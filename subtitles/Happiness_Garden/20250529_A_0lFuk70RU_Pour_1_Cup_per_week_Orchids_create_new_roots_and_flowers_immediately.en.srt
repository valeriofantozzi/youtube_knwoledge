[Music]

28
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,960
started. To make natural fertilizer, use

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,799
rice, a familiar ingredient that is rich

30
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,880
in vitamin B and many essential

31
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,080
minerals, helping orchids grow quickly

32
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,080
and stay healthy.

33
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,119
Use 3 tablespoons of rice to start. This

34
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,799
is the right amount to create an

35
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,799
effective fertilizer mixture for your

36
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,000
orchid. Then add the rice to one liter

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,759

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,220

39
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,879

41
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,280
orchid. And let this mixture sit for 2

42
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,170

43
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,560

45
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,520
The next ingredient to make the

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,960
fertilizer is pure ground

47
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,880
coffee. Coffee contains many valuable

48
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,000
nutrients that help orchids grow healthy

49
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,079
and produce more vibrant

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,920

51
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,780

52
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,840

ensure the safety of your

60
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,760
orchid. For orchids that have finished

61
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,760
blooming, you should cut off the old

62
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,080
flower stems to help the plant focus

63
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,020
nutrients on nurturing new shoots and

64
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,199

92
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,919
We need to observe the of the orchid

93
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,000
regularly. When the tip of the leaf

94
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,759
turns yellow like this, it's a sign that

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,520
the plant may be lacking water or

96
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,760
nitrogen, which is essential for its

97
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:19,919

99
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,360
In this case, we need to water

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,960
adequately and apply fertilizer properly

101
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,400
to help the orchid recover and grow

102
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:35,039

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,560
For an orchid to grow lush and have

always healthy leaves, before

106
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,120
fertilizing, you need to water the plant

107
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,120

Be sure to wipe both the top and

the orchid's delicate root system.

197
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,839
Step three, water this diluted mixture

198
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,839
directly into each orchid pot, allowing

199
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,279
the roots to slowly absorb the nutrients

200
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,279
and promoting strong growth from the

201
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,279
base.

202
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,560
Watering with this mixture provides a

203
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,200
rich source of nutrients directly to the

204
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:12,240
roots, encouraging them to grow quickly,

205
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,320
strongly, and spread throughout the pot,

206
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,250
thereby enhancing the plant's ability to

207
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,429
absorb water and nutrients.

[Music]

209
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,160
Nutrients from coffee and rice water

210
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,160
help improve the structure of the

211
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,720
potting medium, making it looser and

212
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,120
more airrated, creating ideal conditions

213
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,120
for orchid roots to breathe and grow

214
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,120
sustainably.

215
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,120
This mixture also stimulates the growth

216
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,639
of beneficial microorganisms in the

217
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,639
growing medium, supporting the

218
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,639
decomposition of organic matter and

219
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,360
enhancing metabolic activity in the

220
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,360
plant's living environment.

222
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,880
Then soak the orchid pot in this mixture

223
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,120
for about 20 minutes to allow the roots

224
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,040
time to fully absorb the nutrients,

225
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,880
helping the plant recover quickly and

226
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,839
grow

229
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,079
gently remove the orchid pot from the

230
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:28,360
mixture to prevent water logging and

231
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,360
prepare for the next care step.

232
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,240
Step four, use a soft cloth to gently

233
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,240
blot dry any water remaining on the

234
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,680
leaves and in the leaf crevices to

235
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,000
prevent water accumulation that could

236
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,000
harm the orchid.

237
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,639
Blotting off the standing water helps

238
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,959
prevent the growth of mold and

239
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,639
disease-causing bacteria, thereby

240
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,639
keeping the orchid leaves clean and

241
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,839
healthy. Removing standing water also

242
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,839
helps prevent the leaves from rotting or

243
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,000
being damaged due to prolonged exposure

244
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,440
to a moist environment, keeping the

245
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,920
plant healthy and vibrant for

246
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,920
sustainable growth.

247
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,279
Step five, sprinkle cinnamon powder on

248
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,360
the cuts of the flower stems to prevent

249
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,120
the growth of bacteria and fungi,

250
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,550
helping the wounds heal quickly and

251
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:49,070
keeping the orchid healthier.

Now here is the result after 2 weeks of

254
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,560
care. Uh you can clearly see the orchid

255
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,600
has started to develop many new healthy

256
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:11,320
roots signaling recovery and good growth

257
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,320

New roots help the orchid increase its

260
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,000
ability to absorb water and nutrients

261
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,160
from the soil, creating a strong

262
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,430
foundation for the plant to grow healthy

263
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:44,399
and produce more beautiful flowers.
