39
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:09,920

congregate

41
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:28,320

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,479
has a mild bleaching effect so it will

58
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,400
eliminate fungal diseases in pots and

59
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,400

acid in the pot when you use too much

68
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,680
chemical fertilizer to help balance the

69
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,560
pH in the Orchid pot this will stimulate

70
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,560
