00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,899
Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:09,899 --> 00:00:17,897
In this video, I continue to share how to make orchids bloom at the same time with many flower branches.

3
00:00:20,257 --> 00:00:29,895
Orchids after flowers fade.

4
00:00:32,346 --> 00:00:40,892
We cut off all the spent flower stems.

5
00:00:46,663 --> 00:00:56,889
If the plant has never bloomed, it must have 3 or more pairs of leaves.

6
00:00:56,889 --> 00:01:03,144
and healthy roots.

7
00:01:13,184 --> 00:01:23,884
Sprinkle cinnamon powder on the wound to help it heal quickly.

8
00:01:31,882 --> 00:01:39,881
Then wait 1 day for the cut to dry.

9
00:01:50,526 --> 00:02:00,877
Then take 1/2 small onion and cut it into thin slices.

10
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:28,871
 
Add 1 liter of water and bring to a boil.

11
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:36,869
Wait a day then use.

12
00:02:44,868 --> 00:02:54,899
Next take 3 spoons of rice.

13
00:02:56,339 --> 00:03:06,897
Then soak in 1 liter of water and leave for 1 day before using.

14
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:32,892
After a day, filter out the residue.

15
00:03:49,552 --> 00:03:59,886
Mix the two types together.

16
00:04:07,336 --> 00:04:15,883
Clean the leaves with this water.

17
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:28,881
Helps eliminate fungi and bacteria to help orchids grow better.

18
00:04:28,881 --> 00:04:34,879
Do it once a week.

19
00:04:40,198 --> 00:04:50,876
Then use this water to water the orchid roots.

20
00:04:57,295 --> 00:05:06,873
This will help stimulate root and flower stem growth.

21
00:05:09,012 --> 00:05:15,890
Do it once a week.

22
00:05:24,403 --> 00:05:34,868
Place cotton balls between 2 leaves

23
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:09,894
Then spray this water on the cotton pad.

24
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:18,892
This stimulates flower stems to grow.

25
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:31,890
and spray on the top and bottom of the leaves to help supplement nutrients through the leaves for the orchids.

26
00:06:33,956 --> 00:06:42,954
This should be done early in the morning, so that by noon the leaves will dry before the sun shines.

27
00:06:44,711 --> 00:06:54,885
After 30 minutes, remove the cotton and repeat once a week.

28
00:06:57,631 --> 00:07:06,883
and take out the orchid pot.

29
00:07:14,748 --> 00:07:17,880
2 Months Later.

30
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:28,878
Many flower stems grow at the same time.

31
00:07:44,056 --> 00:07:50,874
Orchids also grow many new roots.

32
00:07:52,340 --> 00:08:01,872
With this simple method, you can easily care for blooming orchids at home.

33
00:08:05,171 --> 00:08:15,869

35
00:09:04,893 --> 00:09:16,190
Next, I share a small trick to help stimulate the growth of many small orchids on old orchid branches.

36
00:09:40,186 --> 00:09:51,183
I used a small clove of garlic.

37
00:09:53,183 --> 00:10:16,178
Squeeze water.

38
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:57,170
Apply fresh garlic juice to the places where small orchids can grow.

39
00:11:34,196 --> 00:11:46,027
AFTER 1 WEEK.

40
00:11:52,123 --> 00:12:00,091
Small orchids have grown bigger.

41
00:12:06,995 --> 00:12:16,988
AFTER 2 MONTHS

42
00:12:51,877 --> 00:13:01,846
This orchid I also apply this little trick and it also grows a lot of small orchids.

43
00:13:17,373 --> 00:13:26,341
