Let's get started.

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,439
This is an orchid that has rotted. It

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,760
was discarded, but I brought it home to

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,760
revive it.

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,239
After the orchid blooms, the plant often

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,719
becomes a bit weak because it has used a

15
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,879
lot of energy to flower.

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,200
Um, if not properly cared for, the

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,960
orchid may struggle to recover and it

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,980
will be difficult for it to bloom again

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,520

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,490

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,960
Uh the plant doesn't have to nourish the

weak parts, allowing it to focus on the

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,360
healthy sections.

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,880

For the orchid stem, we need to make a

48
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,519
clean cut to avoid crushing it, which

49
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,000
will reduce the risk of rot from the

51
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,440
These rotting leaves should be removed

52
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,640
and kept far from the garden to prevent

53
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,640

Take one spoonful of cinnamon powder and

put it into a jar.

risk of the plant getting infected.

When the leaves are cleaned, light can

both the top and bottom.

391
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,640
Make sure to thoroughly remove any

392
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,960
remaining water on the leaves to prevent

393
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,120
the plant from becoming overwatered and

394
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,120
to ensure it absorbs nutrients more

395
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,120

Afterward, place the orchid pot in a

399

400
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,600

especially during the intense midday
