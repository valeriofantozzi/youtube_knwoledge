Hello everyone. When your orchid has

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,839
just finished its blooming cycle or even

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,160
has never bloomed, don't worry. Each

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,679
orchid pot has its own growth rhythm.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,679
And with a little patience along with

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,440
the right care steps, you can completely

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,720
help your orchid become healthy and

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,720
bloom brilliantly in the future.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,480
First, you should cut off all the wilted

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,080
flower stems, leaves, and roots. This

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,400
not only helps eliminate potential

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,480
diseases, but also stimulates the orchid

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,800
to grow new healthy leaves, roots, and

14
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,800
flower buds.

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,079
Uh please comment and let me know which

16
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,600

25
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,920
Next, I use eggshells as a natural

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,880
fertilizer to stimulate the orchid to

27
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,799
bloom. Eggshells are rich in calcium and

28
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,799
minerals, helping the orchid not only

29
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,240
stay healthy, but also develop new

30
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,240
flower buds quickly and steadily.

31
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,320
Crush about five eggshells. Grinding

32
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,799
them very finely will help the minerals

33
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,119
dissolve easily into the water and soil,

34
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:07,320
providing nutrients effectively for the

35
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,320
orchid's roots and leaves.

36
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:11,509
[Music]

37
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,440
After crushing, put the eggshells into a

38
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,040
clean jar to prepare for soaking. This

39
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,640
step helps the eggshells blend with

40
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,720
other nutrients during the soaking

41
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,080
process, creating a nutrient-rich

42
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,080
natural fertilizer for the orchid.

43
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:40,480
[Music]

44
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,200
Then add about 50 ml of vinegar into the

45
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,959
jar. Vinegar helps the eggshells ferment

46
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,360
slightly and dissolve the organic

47
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,360
calcium, turning it into a fertilizer

48
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,000
that is easily absorbed by the orchid's

49
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,000
roots and leaves.

50
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,120
You can see immediately after pouring

51
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,360
the vinegar in, a lively reaction occurs

52
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,360
between the vinegar and the eggshells.

53
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,360
This process produces quickly soluble

54
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,040
organic calcium ready to provide

55
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,810
nutrients effectively to the orchid's

56
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,440
roots and leaves.

57
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:17,040
[Music]

58
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,120
Then let the mixture sit for 1 day. This

59
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,360
process allows the calcium and minerals

60
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,599
from the eggshells to fully dissolve,

61
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,599
creating a nutrient-rich solution ready

62
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:29,159
to nourish the orchid's roots, leaves,

63
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,159
and flower buds.

64
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,200
After one day, strain out the remaining

65
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,519
residue. This step makes the solution

66
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,940
clear and smooth, ready to be diluted

67
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:50,879
and used directly for your orchid pot.

[Music]

69
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,840
After straining, dilute the solution

70
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,519
with about 3 L of water. Diluting helps

71
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,599
the nutrients from the eggshells spread

72
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,840
evenly, is safe for the roots and

73
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:05,840
leaves, and also stimulates the new

74
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:15,360
flower buds to grow strongly.

[Music]

76
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,040
Step one, water this fertilizer mixture

77
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,919
directly onto the orchid's roots and

78
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,080
growing medium about once every 2 weeks.

79
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,759
Regular watering provides continuous

80
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,320
nutrients, helping the orchid stay

81
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:32,840
healthy, stimulating root growth and

82
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,840
preparing for new flower buds.

83
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,000
Eggshells contain a lot of calcium,

84
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,919
helping the orchid stay healthy and

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,560
increasing its resistance to pests and

86
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,560
diseases. Not only that, eggshells are

87
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,240
also rich in potassium, an important

88
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,320
nutrient that helps stimulate flower

89
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,800
development, bringing more vibrant and

90
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,800
consistent blooms.

[Music]

92
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,880
In addition, the nitrogen and phosphorus

93
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,840
in eggshells also help the leaves and

94
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,840
roots grow strongly. When the roots are

95
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,680
healthy and the leaves are green, the

96
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,400
orchid can absorb nutrients more

97
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:19,400
effectively, ready to nurture new flower

98
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,400
buds in a healthy and sustainable way.

[Music]

100
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,600
Step two, spray this solution directly

101
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,800
onto the orchid's leaves about once

102
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,880
every 2 weeks. Regular spraying helps

103
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,880
the leaves absorb more nutrients,

104
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,800
maintain a lush green color, and

105
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,800
increase the vitality of the entire

106
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,199

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,199
efficient photosynthesis.

108
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,000
The vinegar in the solution helps remove

109
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,800
dirt, insects, and fungal diseases on

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,479
the orchid's leaves and flowers.

111
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,400
Meanwhile, the calcium from the

112
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,280
eggshells helps the leaves become

113
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,880
stronger, increases resistance to pests,

114
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,880
and maintains the plant's long-term

115
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,880
vitality.

117
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,039
After watering, remember to place the

118
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,520
orchid pot in a spot with gentle

119
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,000
sunlight. Gentle light helps the orchid

120
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,720
photosynthesize effectively, increases

121
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,639
nutrient absorption, and stimulates bud

122
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,240
development, preparing for the vibrant

123
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,479

125
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,639
care and recovery. You can see the

six to seven flower stems at the same

137

This orchid is infected by bacteria

171
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,640
causing its stem and roots to gradually

172
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,640
rot.

174
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,160
First, cut off and clean the rotting

175
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,880
parts on the orchid stem and roots. This

176
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,880
step helps remove harmful bacteria,

177
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,480
prevent the disease from spreading, and

178
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,959
prepare the plant to begin a healthy

only prevents bacteria from spreading

183
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,480
