Hello everyone, so that the orchid garden always has many long-lasting and sustainable blooming flowers

2
00:00:46,292 --> 00:00:50,291
We need to create many small orchids

3
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:58,322
Helps plants grow lush green

4
00:00:58,322 --> 00:01:02,288
Today I share how to propagate baby orchids

5
00:01:02,288 --> 00:01:06,087
from this flower branch.

6
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:16,219
You only need to use a small clove of garlic, garlic contains a lot

7
00:01:18,218 --> 00:01:28,016
Many vitamins and nutrients help plants quickly root and grow very well

8
00:01:30,016 --> 00:01:39,014
and contains many substances necessary for bud growth.

9
00:01:45,053 --> 00:01:50,045
Add 500 ml of room temperature water

10
00:01:50,045 --> 00:01:56,947
You cover it and leave it for a day.

11
00:01:56,947 --> 00:02:02,285
You need to choose flower branches that are still green

12
00:02:02,285 --> 00:02:08,875
The tree grows well

13
00:02:16,873 --> 00:02:26,871
Peeling off the protective film will help the sprouts grow more easily and quickly.

14
00:02:34,232 --> 00:02:39,202
Although garlic is great for growing small plants,

15
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:44,568
But garlic is very spicy, you cannot use it directly.

16
00:02:44,568 --> 00:02:48,567
Leave it for a day to reduce the heat of the garlic.

17
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:53,966
When used directly, the flower branches will dry immediately

18
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:04,111
1 Day later

19
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:20,894
I will put the orchid here

20
00:03:20,894 --> 00:03:26,365
You need to leave it on for 5 minutes, you can't leave it on too long.

21
00:03:33,888 --> 00:03:38,857
After soaking for 5 minutes,

22
00:03:57,415 --> 00:04:06,385
Sprinkle cinnamon powder on the cut to help the wound heal quickly and not rot.

23
00:04:14,985 --> 00:04:22,982
Soaking the moss in garlic water for 5 minutes helps disinfect the substrate and stimulates rooting.

24
00:04:41,975 --> 00:04:50,943
Then take the moss out and squeeze the water dry.

25
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:05,373
Place the orchid branch in

26
00:05:09,248 --> 00:05:16,238
Cover with a clear plastic bottle with vents

27
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:28,102
You should water and mist regularly to keep the growing medium moist.

28
00:05:28,102 --> 00:05:36,201
We place it in places with temperatures from 24 to 29 degrees

29
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:46,898
after 1 month

30
00:05:54,375 --> 00:06:02,362
Baby orchids develop very healthy leaves and roots.

31
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:31,290
When the small tree has begun to grow, choose a tree that receives light from the tree to help it photosynthesize.

32
00:06:31,523 --> 00:06:39,888
We regularly mist it to moisturize so that this small tree can grow better

33
00:06:56,688 --> 00:07:04,683
and after 2 months the tree has grown very well

34
00:07:57,873 --> 00:08:05,871
Please transfer the tree to another pot and we will replant it with pine bark and moss

35
00:08:07,105 --> 00:08:15,273
Let the plant receive light slowly, don't rush.

36
00:08:15,273 --> 00:08:25,207
To help plants gradually get used to the new environment more easily.

37
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:34,899
You keep the stem higher than the substrate to avoid stem rot.

38
00:08:51,026 --> 00:08:56,037
