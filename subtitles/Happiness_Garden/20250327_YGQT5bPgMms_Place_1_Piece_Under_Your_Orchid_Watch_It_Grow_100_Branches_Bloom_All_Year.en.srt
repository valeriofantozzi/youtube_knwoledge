75
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,720
not use

76
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:31,960
it take about 50 ml spr 10 TS beam of

82
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,599
add one liter and four cups of

caring for orchids after blooming is

88
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,800
important so that the plant recovers and

89
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:42,800
continues to bloom in the following

90
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:55,520
