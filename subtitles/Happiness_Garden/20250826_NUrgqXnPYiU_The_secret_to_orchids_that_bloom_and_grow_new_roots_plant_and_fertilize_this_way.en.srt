00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,279
Welcome to the happiness garden, where

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,960
every orchid tells its own story. Here

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,800
we not only learn how to care for the

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,519
plants, but also feel the beauty and

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,679
wonder of nature through every leaf,

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,480
every new root, and every blooming

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,480
petal. Let's enjoy the peaceful moments

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,480
and the joy that the flowers bring each

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,480
day.

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,519
After 1 to two years of planting, each

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,840
orchid should have its medium changed

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,920
and be transferred to a suitable pot so

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,840
the roots can grow, receive enough

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,320
nutrients and water, helping the plant

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,760
stay healthy, grow new roots, and

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,520
prepare for the next flowers.

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,440
Old growing medium often attracts

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,440
insects like snails, which can harm the

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,879
plant's roots and also creates

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,320
conditions for mold to develop.

21
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,879
When the growing medium has

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,199
deteriorated, it can no longer maintain

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,960
proper irerration and drainage, making

24
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,600
it difficult for the roots to absorb

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,760
nutrients. Therefore, replacing it with

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,680
new medium not only protects the roots,

27
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,680
but also helps the orchid grow more

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,680
vigorously.

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,640
Before changing the growing medium,

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,680
perform a preliminary check and remove

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,119
all harmful insects. This helps protect

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,000
the young roots of the orchid and

33
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,080
prevent insect born diseases. Only when

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
the roots are safe should we proceed to

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,150
replant them into the new pot and

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,360
medium.

[Music]

38
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,840
Then I remove the old pot because it is

39
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,759
too tight and no longer provides enough

40
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,680
space for the roots to grow.

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,600
Transferring to a new pot of suitable

42
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,560
size allows the orchid roots to spread

43
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,640
comfortably, absorb nutrients better,

44
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,799
and creates conditions for the plant to

45
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,110
be healthy. preparing for the next

46
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,840
blooms.

[Music]

48
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,399
Next, I remove the damaged or rotting

49
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,880
roots so the plant can focus on

50
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,119
developing healthy roots. This helps

51
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,200
prevent disease attacks and ensures the

52
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,280
orchid absorbs nutrients effectively,

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,280
preparing for strong growth in the near

54
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,280
future.

[Music]

56
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,640
You can see that if it is not

57
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,640
transferred to a new pot, these young

58
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,640
roots will not have enough space to

59
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,640
grow.

60
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,429
[Music]

61
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,160
Then I prepare a larger pot with good

62
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,160
drainage holes for planting.

63
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,920
I place a few small pieces of foam at

64
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,239
the bottom of the pot to help improve

65
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,400
drainage and prevent the roots from

66
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,319
being water logged.

67
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,239
This method also creates extra air

68
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,840
space, helping the roots grow healthy

69
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,879
and allowing the orchid to absorb

70
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,879
nutrients from the new medium.

[Music]

72
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,840
Then I plant the orchid using sterilized

73
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,000
pine bark chips. A clean medium helps

74
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,920
prevent mold and pests while providing

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,400
an ideal airrated environment for the

76
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,959
roots to grow vigorously and absorb

77
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,959
nutrients effectively.

[Music]

79
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,280
The new clean medium along with a larger

80
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,599
pot provides the roots with optimal

81
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,840
space to grow, absorb nutrients

82
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,840
effectively, and keep the orchid

83
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,440
healthy. This is an important step to

84
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,440
prepare for vibrant blooms in the

85
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,440

93
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,400
After planting, leave the orchid in a

94
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,560
cool, airy place for one day without

95
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,800
watering. This helps the new roots

96
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,639
stabilize, reduces the risk of root rot,

97
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,120
and prepares them to absorb nutrients

98
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,120
from the new medium.

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,400
Today, to make natural fertilizer, I

100
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,360
will share how to make fertilizer from

101
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,440
potatoes. This method is simple,

102
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,440
environmentally friendly, and provides

103
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:44,199
all the necessary nutrients for orchids

104
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,199
to grow healthy and bloom brilliantly.

105
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,000
We only need about 10 g of potatoes to

106
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,080
make natural fertilizer. This small

107
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
amount already provides enough essential

108
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,800
nutrients to help the orchid stay

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,199
healthy, grow new roots, and prepare for

110
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,199
beautiful blooms.

111
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,150
Place the potatoes in a clean container

112
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,690
and add 500 ml of water.

[Music]

115
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,440
Then blend the potatoes with the water

116
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,440
to create a natural fertilizer solution.

117
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:40,220
[Applause]

118
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,759
Add another 500 mil of water so that we

119
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,759
have about one liter of the potato

120
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,759
mixture.

[Music]

122
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,319
To enhance the effectiveness of the

123
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,840
fertilizer, I add a spoonful of

124
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,000
molasses.

125
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,919
Molasses provides extra sugar and

126
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,919
nutrients for the microorganisms in the

127
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,600
medium, helping the orchid roots grow

128
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,400
vigorously and allowing the plant to

129
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,400
absorb nutrients better.

130
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,639
After adding the molasses, stir the

131
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,720
mixture well so that all the ingredients

132
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,039
are fully blended. This helps the

133
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,039
natural fertilizer work at its maximum

134
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,039

138
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,600
helps the natural fertilizer solution

139
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,759
stabilize, allows the nutrients to blend

140
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,000

141
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,710

144
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,240
After one day, take about 100 ml of the

145
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,240
clear liquid from the top to dilute.

146
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,319
This is the settled solution, easy to

gentle and safe for the roots while

156
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,039

for for about 2 weeks while while still

164
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,759
retaining its nutrients for the orchids.

Um, wiping the leaves with this mixture

170
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,479
helps remove long accumulated dust,

171
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,159
making the leaves cleaner and allowing

172
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,159
the plant to photosynthesize more

173
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,159
effectively.

174
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,120
When wiping the leaves, the nutrients in

175
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,640
the mixture will be absorbed directly

176
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,959
through through the leaf surface,

177
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:55,800
helping the plant take them in quickly

178
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,800
and receive timely nourishment.

179
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,920
This mixture also helps prevent the

180
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,600
growth of mold and reduces some small

181
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,920
insects that cling to the leaves and

182
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,920
cause damage.

183
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,040
After being wiped, the leaves will

184
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,200
become glossy, green, healthy, and full

185
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,200

Regularly caring for the leaves in this

188
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,839
way also helps boost the plant's

189
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:32,200
resistance, supporting the orchid to

190
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,200

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,160
which country you are watching the video

193
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,880
from.

194
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,640
It's wonderful that we can connect and

195
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,640
chat with each other from all around the

196
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,640
world.

197
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,760
Method two, pour the mixture into a

198
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,399
spray bottle and gently spray it over

199
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:02,040
the entire leaves, stems, roots, and

200
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,040
even the growing medium.

201
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,720
When spraying, make sure to cover both

202
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,519
the top and bottom surfaces of the

203
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,880
leaves, especially the underside.

204
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,720
This is where the plant absorbs

205
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,880
nutrients more effectively and where

206
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,399
insects often hide. So, thorough

207
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:31,079
spraying will help the orchid leaves

208
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,079
stay healthier and free from disease.

209
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,160
Spraying this mixture helps the leaves,

210
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,480
stems, and roots of the orchid absorb

211
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:43,399
nutrients quickly, allowing the plant to

212
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,399
grow more fully and become healthier.

213
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,240
A light mist also keeps the leaf surface

214
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,240
cool and clean, reduces dust buildup,

215
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,180
and lowers the risk of fungal diseases

216
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,839
developing.

217
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,680
[Applause]

218
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,920
When sprayed regularly, the orchid

219
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,920
leaves become glossy green. The roots

220
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,399
grow stronger and the plant blooms more

221
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,399
easily with beautiful longerlasting

222
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,399
flowers.

223
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,879
[Music]

224
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,160
Method three, water this mixture

225
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,200
directly onto the roots and the growing

226
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,200
medium. This this simple way allows the

227
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,440
orchid to absorb nutrients right from

228
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,600
the roots while keeping the medium moist

229
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,360
and nutrient-rich, creating the best

230
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,800
conditions for strong growth.

231
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,120
Watering with this mixture allows the

232
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,279
roots to directly absorb nutrients,

233
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,079
helping the orchid become healthier,

234
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:43,079
grow new roots quickly, and develop more

235
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,079
steadily.

236
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,800
When absorbed into the growing medium,

237
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,279
the mixture provides a nutrient-rich

238
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,360
environment, helping the medium not only

239
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,550
retain moisture well, but also nourish

240
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,880
the plant over the long term.

241
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:58,720
[Music]

242
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,360
Regular watering also stimulates the

243
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,600
harmonious growth of leaves, stems, and

244
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,040
roots, creating a solid foundation for

245
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,680
the orchid to soon produce beautiful

246
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,680
blooms.

247
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,480
After watering, you can soak the whole

248
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,120
orchid pot in the mixture for about 20

249
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,959
minutes so the roots can absorb the

250
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,200
maximum nutrients and refresh the

251
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:22,920
growing medium, helping the plant grow

252
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,920
strong and last longer.

253
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,519
Uh while waiting for the soak, use a

254
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,360
soft cloth to gently dab the water

255
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,760
accumulated on the leaves and in the

256
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,920
leaf crevices. This helps keep the

257
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,760
leaves dry and airy, reduces the risk of

258
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,000
leaf rot, and protects the orchid to

259
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,000
grow healthy.

260
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,880
[Music]

261
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,800
Dabbing the water off the leaves also

262
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,959
helps prevent mold and bacteria from

263
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,279
growing, keeping the orchid leaves

264
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,790
clean, healthy, and ready to absorb

265
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:19,680
nutrients.

266
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:21,839
[Music]

267
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,000
After soaking for about 20 minutes, take

268
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,320
the orchid pot out and place it in a

269
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,760
cool, airy spot with gentle sunlight.

270
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,320
This allows the plant to absorb

271
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,639
nutrients gradually, the roots to dry

272
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:37,399
naturally and helps the orchid grow

273
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,399
healthy, preparing for beautiful blooms.

274
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,720
And here are the results after 2 weeks.

275
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,720
You can see that many new roots have

276
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,240
developed. This shows that the care

277
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,760
method and the use of the natural

278
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,639
fertilizer mixture have helped the

279
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,440
orchid uh absorb nutrients well and grow

280
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,440
healthily.

281
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,920
These new roots will help the orchid

282
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,839
absorb more nutrients, nourish healthy

283
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,000
green leaves, and prepare for the next

284
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:13,000
flowers to bloom strong, vibrant, and

285
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
long-lasting.

286
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,199
Thanks to proper care, the leaves have

287
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,279
become glossy green and sturdy,

288
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,680
reflecting the orchid's good health and

289
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,680
strong growth.

290
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:34,000
Glossy green and sturdy leaves help the

291
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,079
orchid photosynthesize more effectively,

292
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,079
boost its resistance, and prepare it

293
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,880
well for even and beautiful flowering in

294
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,959
the future.

295
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,040
Uh, this is another orchid that has been

296
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,040
cared for using this method before. And

297
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,280
you can see that its roots have

298
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:54,440
developed very healthily.

299
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,440
[Music]

300
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,600
This proves that the method of using the

301
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,680
natural fertilizer mixture combined with

302
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,519
proper care helps the orchid develop

303
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,680
comprehensively

304
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,240
from roots, stems, and leaves to

305
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:13,000
flowers, creating a strong foundation

306
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,000
for healthy growth and beautiful blooms.

307
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,279
You can see the large and beautiful

308
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,519
petals with many blooms opening

309
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:24,120
