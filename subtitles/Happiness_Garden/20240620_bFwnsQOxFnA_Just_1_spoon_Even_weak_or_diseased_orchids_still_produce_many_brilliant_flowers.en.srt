It would be wonderful to have you accompany me. 🌸

6
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:43,725
When the orchid has finished blooming or the plant is stunted, slow to grow and has not yet bloomed.

7
00:00:48,111 --> 00:00:52,890
Cut all dry branches, roots and leaves.

8
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:58,889
This helps orchids focus their energy on healthy growth.

9
00:00:58,889 --> 00:01:04,888
Removing dead parts helps prevent disease, improves air circulation, 

10
00:01:04,888 --> 00:01:10,887
and encourages the growth of new roots and leaves, resulting in stronger and more vibrant blooms. ✨

11
00:01:23,676 --> 00:01:33,882
then take 3 teaspoons.

12
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:48,112
Add 4 cups of boiled water (about 1 liter of water).

13
00:01:58,771 --> 00:02:06,742
then brew until the water cools.

14
00:02:06,742 --> 00:02:08,742
After the water cools, filter to remove sediment.

15
00:02:12,537 --> 00:02:22,506
After the water cools, filter to remove residue.

16
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:26,872
Please comment to me which country you are watching the video from!  

17
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:32,870
It's great that we can chat together from all over the world!

18
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:38,636
In addition to the English dub, we've now created dubs in French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, 

19
00:02:38,636 --> 00:02:45,634
Japanese, Hindi, and Indonesian to help you hear and understand the content more easily.

20
00:02:46,355 --> 00:02:56,366
Then add 1 US gallon of water (about 3.8 liters) to the mixture.

21
00:03:08,692 --> 00:03:18,661
First, use this water to thoroughly wipe the top and bottom of the leaves.

22
00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:35,325
This clears dirt and removes fungus, disease and insects that damage the leaves.

23
00:03:38,589 --> 00:03:46,556
Apply this method once a month.

24
00:03:53,484 --> 00:04:00,472
Helps leaves stay green, strong and resistant to pests.

25
00:04:08,802 --> 00:04:16,783
Then you use this water to water the orchid roots.

26
00:04:19,251 --> 00:04:28,247
This helps roots grow healthily and prevents root rot.

27
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:46,344
Coffee contains many minerals necessary for the growth of orchids.

28
00:04:52,189 --> 00:05:02,174
Organic phosphorus and potassium found in coffee help roots and flowers develop outstandingly.

29
00:05:05,429 --> 00:05:15,426
Do this twice a month for your orchids so they grow and bloom profusely.

30
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:42,599
Or you can also use this water to spray the entire orchid.

31
00:05:58,477 --> 00:06:08,461
Thoroughly spray the top and bottom of the leaves to remove dirt and insects from the leaf surface.

32
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:19,659
Do this every 2 weeks.

33
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:35,755
Coffee water helps repel orchid pests very effectively.

34
00:06:43,973 --> 00:06:52,952
After spraying and soaking in this water for about 5 minutes, the insects will run away from the orchid pot.

35
00:06:55,885 --> 00:07:01,951
If you encounter any difficulties during the orchid growing process, don't hesitate to comment! 

36
00:07:01,951 --> 00:07:08,949
I am always ready to support you so you can grow healthy orchids and bloom lots of flowers. 🌸

37
00:07:13,095 --> 00:07:21,080
Then take the orchid pot out and place it in a cool place with enough light for the orchid to grow.

38
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:26,945
2 Months later.

39
00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:36,843
Orchids will begin to sprout and bloom profusely.

40
00:07:44,295 --> 00:07:52,274
Blooming flowers have bright colors.

41
00:07:55,529 --> 00:08:02,505
Shoe petals will stay fresh longer.

42
00:08:03,505 --> 00:08:12,770
The flowers bloom for up to 6 months before fading.

43
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:26,900
Hopefully the video will help you a lot in taking better care of orchids at home.
