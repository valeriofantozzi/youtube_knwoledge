00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
I am very happy to welcome you to my

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,799
little garden, a peaceful corner to

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,559
breathe with nature. Here we will

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,400
explore the beauty of plants and share

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,719
simple yet inspiring ways to care for

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,559
them.

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,119
Today I happened to find a weak orchid

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,760
that had been thrown away. I suddenly

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,480
thought with just a little love and the

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,519
right care, the plant can still come

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,519
back to life beautifully. So, I want to

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,840
share with you a very simple yet

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,160
incredibly effective semi-hydroponic

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,239
method for growing orchids. One that you

15
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,920
can easily try at home. This method

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,760
helps the plant absorb moisture and

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,960
nutrients more steadily, allowing the

18
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,559
roots to grow strong and healthy. If you

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,399
love orchids and want a modern,

20
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,200
convenient way to care for them that

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:51,890
still feels natural and full of grace,

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:54,960
this is the perfect choice for you.

[Music]

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,440
First, you need to gently cut off all

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,280
the damaged leaves and roots. This helps

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,360
remove parts that could cause fungal

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,600
infections and allows the plant to focus

28
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,040
on on nurturing the remaining healthy

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,200
roots. Be sure to use clean, sterilized

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,760
scissors before cutting to avoid

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,680
spreading any infection to the plant.

32
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,680
After this step, the orchid will look

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,439
tidier and be ready for the recovery

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,530
process in the semi-hydroponic

35
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:33,280
environment.

[Music]

37
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,040
Um, since the plant no longer has

38
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,720
leaves, you can see that the two flower

39
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,920
spikes, although the petals have fallen

40
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,520
off, are still fresh. Inside these

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,720
spikes, there are still plenty of

42
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,799
nutrients. So, I decided to keep them.

43
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,399
When we let the spikes remain, the

44
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,799
remaining nutrients inside will

45
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,560
gradually return to the stem, giving the

46
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,840
plant extra energy to nourish and

47
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,840
develop new shoots and leaves.

48
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,360
After trimming, rinse the entire plant

49
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,280
under running water. The gentle stream

50
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,599

51
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,120
remaining dirt or mold from the roots

52
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,959
while also allowing the plant to

53
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,959
reabsorb a bit of natural moisture.

54
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,640
Be very gentle when handling the roots

55
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,319
as this is a stage when the plant is

56
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,319
very weak and sensitive.

57
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,000
After rinsing, place the plant in a well

58
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,740
ventilated area to let it dry

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,360
completely.

[Music]

61
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,959
Next, we will prepare a natural

62
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,239
fertilizer that helps the plant recover

63
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,560
quickly and grow strong.

64
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,959
The first ingredient is very familiar.

65
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,280
It's rice. You only need about 3

66
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,879
teaspoons of rice, a small amount, but

67
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,360
enough to create a rich source of

68
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,120
nutrients for the plant. Rice is not

69
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,280
only a food that provides energy for

70
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,480
humans, but also contains many B

71
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,560
vitamins, minerals, and starch, all of

72
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,800
which help nourish strong roots,

73
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,360
stimulate new shoots, and support the

74
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,360
plant's quick recovery.

75
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,460
Next, add about 600 ml of water to soak

76
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:14,480
the rice.

[Music]

78
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,120
The final ingredient is red apple cider

79
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,159
vinegar. Just one small spoonful is

80
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,640
enough. Apple cider vinegar provides

81
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,440
mild antibacterial properties, balances

82
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,519
the pH in the growing environment, and

83
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,519
stimulates the roots to absorb nutrients

84
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,040
more effectively.

85
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,040
If you don't have red apple cider

86
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,799
vinegar, you can easily replace it with

87
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,840
any other type of fruit vinegar you have

88
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,760
at home. Whether it's apple, grape, or

89
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,840
pineapple vinegar, they all offer

90
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,250
similar benefits in helping the plant

91
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,360

the solution sit overnight to ferment

95

slightly. This natural fermentation

96

process helps break down the nutrients

97
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,650
in the rice, making them easier for the

98
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,040
plant to absorb.

plant in this fertilizer solution for

192
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,839
about 20 minutes. During the soaking,

193
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,000
the nutrients from the rice and

194
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,560
fermented red apple cider vinegar will

195
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,240
directly penetrate the roots and stem,

196
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,360
providing the energy needed for the

197
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,360
plant to recover.

199
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,920
After soaking for about 20 minutes,

200
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,000
gently lift the orchid out and replant

201
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,320
it into the semi-hydroponic pot with

202
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,320
fresh water.

203
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,680
Next, place the pot in a spot with

204
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,600
gentle sunlight, avoiding direct harsh

205
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,240
sun to prevent damage to the roots and

206
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:54,800

207
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,560
enough light to grow and recover better.

208
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,480
Uh, after soaking, you can use the

209
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,000
remaining fertilizer solution to water

210
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,760

211
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,480

213
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,640
This method helps all the orchids

214
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,720
receive natural nutrients, stimulates

215
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,560
strong root and new chute growth, and

216
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,000

the entire garden.

218
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,240
Spraying the solution onto the stem and

219
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,240
leaves helps the plant absorb additional

220
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,920
easily assimilable nutrients, supporting

221
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,200
the formation and growth of new leaf

222
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,120
shoots. Moreover, these nutrients also

223
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,519
help the flowers bloom evenly and last

224
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,440
longer, allowing the orchid to remain

225
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,330
vibrant and beautiful throughout the

226
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,440

When spraying the mixture onto the

roots, the nutrients from the rice and

230
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,440
red apple cider vinegar will directly

penetrate, providing essential vitamins,

232
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,560
minerals, and enzymes. This helps the

233
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,860
orchid roots grow strong, thereby

234
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:06,079

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,959
Uh you can see that the root system has

240
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,760
grown very strong with many new roots

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,320
Not only that, the orchid has also grown

244
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,399
new leaves, showing that the recovery

245
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,399

absorb more nutrients and water, thereby

251
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,079
speeding up its recovery. They will also

252
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,560
serve as a solid foundation for the

253
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,959
plant to form new shoots and flowers,

254
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,440

semihydroponic method.

295
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,920

301
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,760
You can see that after the plant

302
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,639
absorbed all the nutrients from the

303
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:52,240
still fresh flower spikes, they have now

304
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:54,959
aged, dried, and are no longer alive.

305
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,720
This is completely normal as the

306
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,560
nutrients in the flower spikes have been

307
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,800
fully used by the plant to nourish new

308
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:04,040
roots and leaves, helping it recover and

309
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,040

[Music]

311
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,199
The dried flower spikes are now just

312
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,600
natural remnants and do not affect the

313
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,920
overall health of the orchid. So, we can

314
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,560
remove them. Removing the dried spikes

315
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,440
helps the plant look tidier, reduces the

316
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,519
risk of fungal infections, and creates

317
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,519
space for new leaves and shoots to grow

318
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,519
better.

319
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,680
Then continue planting the orchid into

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,079

321
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,720
roots are evenly spread and the stem is

322
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,800
securely supported. Don't forget to

323
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,680
change the water and feed the plant with

324
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,000
natural fertilizer every 1 to two weeks

325
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,959

326
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,959
full nutrients. With this regular care,

327
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:03,199
the orchid will continue to recover,

328
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,120
grow new, strong roots and leaves, and

329
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:08,120
