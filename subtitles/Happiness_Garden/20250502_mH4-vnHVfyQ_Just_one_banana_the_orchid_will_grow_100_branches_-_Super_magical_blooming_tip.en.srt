00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,880
Welcome everyone to my beloved little

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:08,640
garden where I share simple yet

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,640
heartfelt things for my beautiful orchid

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,400
pots. Today I will share with you how to

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,279
make a simple natural fertilizer at home

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,760
to help restore the or the orchid after

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,920
it has finished blooming so the plant

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,800
can continue to grow healthily and

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,800
prepare for the next blooming.

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,640
Um, you can see that my orchid has many

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,600
spent flower stems, but don't worry,

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,239
it's a normal sign and we can help the

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,239
plant recover

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,960
better. We need to remove all the wilted

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,719
petals so the plant can focus its energy

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,600
on developing roots and leaves,

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,600
preparing for the next blooming.

[Music]

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,119
The unopened buds can be stimulated to

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,040
produce new flower stems here, helping

21
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,360
the plant bloom continuously throughout

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,040
the

23
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,439
year. As for the buds that have already

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,720
bloomed, they cannot bloom again. So, we

25
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,040
just need to take good care of the

26
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,040
remaining buds.

28
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,240
Next, take about 250 ml of water into a

29
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,399
cup. Next, you need to prepare baking

30
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,799
soda. This is the main ingredient that

31
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:54,880
helps adjust the pH in the orchid pot

32
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,880
and prevent some harmful fungi and

33
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,960
bacteria. Just about a/ teaspoon of

34
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,880
baking soda is enough. No need for too

35
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,119
much as we only need the right amount to

36
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,679
achieve the desired effect without

37
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,679
harming the plant.

38
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,480
Next, you need neem oil. Neem oil helps

39
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,080
repel insects and prevent bacterial and

40
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,360
fungal diseases, helping to protect the

41
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,360
orchid plant and keep it

42
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,959
healthy. Just one teaspoon of neem oil

43
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,800
is enough. This amount of oil will

44
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,840
create an effective solution without

45
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,680
overloading the plant.

46
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,680
Stir well to ensure that the neem oil

47
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,080
and baking soda dissolve completely into

48
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,560
the water, creating a uniform solution

49
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,560
ready to

50
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,160
use. Step one, use a soft cloth to soak

51
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,720
up this mixture and gently wipe both the

52
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,599
top and bottom of the leaves, helping to

53
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,560
remove dust and small insects while also

54
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,560
protecting the leaves from diseases.

[Music]

56
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,599
Neem oil can help maintain the natural

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,680
moisture of the leaves, preventing them

58
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,239
from drying out and keeping the leaves

59
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,239
soft and fresh.

60
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,360
The combination of baking soda and neem

61
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,120
oil not only helps remove insects, but

62
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,120
also creates a protective layer on the

63
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,159
leaves, helping the plant effectively

64
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,159
resist pests and diseases.

65
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,879
After wiping the leaves, pour this

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,640
mixture into a spray bottle. Make sure

67
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,560
the spray bottle is clean and ready to

68
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,359
spray evenly on the leaves and the

69
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,359
orchid's growing medium.

76
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,280
mixture helps remove dirt and small

77
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,040
insects, protects the leaves from

photosynthesize more

80
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:06,320
effectively. When sprayed on the stem,

81
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,560
it helps prevent the growth of bacteria

82
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,560
and fungi, keeping the stem healthy and

83
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,200
preventing it from rotting or getting

84
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,339

Step three, use a soft cloth to absorb

92
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,360
the excess water on the leaves and

93
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,440
between the leaf veins, helping the

94
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,600
leaves dry quickly and preventing mold

95
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,600

101
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,479
After that, place the orchid pot in a

102
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,080
spot with gentle sunlight and good

103
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:18,280
airflow. Do not water it for 3 days to

104
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,800
allow the plant time to absorb the

105
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:24,160
nutrients and recover

106
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,840
naturally. Next, we will prepare another

107
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,919
very special natural fertilizer for

108
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,440
orchids. You only need a few familiar

109
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:34,000
ingredients. Ripe banana, garlic, honey,

110
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,000
and warm

111
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,479
water. Take one ripe banana and slice it

112
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,639
into thin pieces. Bananas provide plenty

113
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,120
of potassium and natural nutrients that

114
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,120

116
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,479
Um, then put the sliced banana into a

117
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,080
clean jar. A glass or plastic jar will

118
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,479

Next, take three cloves of garlic and

122
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,599
chop them finely. Garlic helps with

123
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:37,800
antibacterial and antifungal properties

124
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,800

135
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,479
The next ingredient is one teaspoon of

136
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,480
dry yeast. The dry yeast will help

137
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,080
ferment the mixture, creating enzymes

138
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,080

140
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,720
Uh the next ingredient is honey. Add

141
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,560
about 1 teaspoon of honey which will

142
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,600
enrich the mixture with nutrients and

143
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,600

completely with water leaving some space

152
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,480
at the top uh because fermentation will

153
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,720
produce gas.

154
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,360
This space allows the mixture to avoid

155
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,920
overflowing as gas is created during the

156
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,920
fermentation

157
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,959
process. Then close the lid and place

158
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,399
the jar in a cool airy spot for 3 weeks.

159
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,200
After this time, the mixture will

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,079
provide nutrients to help these buds

192
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,079
develop and bloom in the

193
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:39,920
future. Just water each pot with about

194
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,839
10 tablespoons of the GE mixture. Uh,

195
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,519
this amount is enough to provide

196
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:48,399
nutrients to the plant without

197
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,399
overwatering and causing root rot.

Uh, in addition to the English

200
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,959
voiceover, we have now created

201
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,120
voiceovers in French, German, Italian,

202
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,839
Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Hindi,

203
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,959
and Indonesian to help you listen to and

204
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,959
understand the content more

205
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,040
easily. For languages without

206
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:13,560
voiceovers, we have created subtitles so

207
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,560
you can read and understand the content.

208
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,880
Then pour this mixture into a spray

209
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,880
bottle.

210
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,040
Step six, spray this mixture over the

211
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,199
entire orchid pot, including the leaves,

212
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,800
stem, roots, and growing medium.

213
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,720
Spraying helps evenly distribute

214
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,360
nutrients, stimulating the plant to grow

215
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,360
and bloom

216
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,600
continuously. When you spray it on the

217
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,399
leaves and roots, it helps the orchid

218
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,959
easily absorb essential nutrients from

219
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,639
the GE mixture, supporting healthy

220
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,120
growth and strengthening the root

221
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,120
system.

222
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,079
Spraying on the stem and unopened nodes

223
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,600
helps stimulate the orchid to bloom

224
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:20,720
regularly, contributing to beautiful and

225
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,720
long- lasting flowering

226
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,600

227
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,000
harmful insects and supports disease

228
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,360
prevention, making the orchid plant

229
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,120
healthier. Wait 20 minutes before

230
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,360
removing the cloth wrapped around the

231
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,040

232
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,639
the nutrients to be absorbed and to

233
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,959
stimulate the nodes to develop new

234
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,959

236
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,160
the cloth wrapped around the nodes. This

237
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,680
amount of time is enough for the

238
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,279
nutrients to be absorbed and to

239
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,600
stimulate the nodes to develop new

240
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,600
flower spikes.

241
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,970
[Music]

242
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,160
After 20 minutes, remove the cloth

243
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,639
wrapped around the nodes and repeat once

244
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,440
a week. This helps stimulate the growth

245
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,440
of new flower

247
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:22,639

248
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,800
about 20 minutes, remember to take it

249
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,639
out. This helps the plant absorb

250
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,959
nutrients effectively without causing

251
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,959

00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:35,519
logging. Step seven, use a cloth to

253
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,320
absorb the excess water on the leaves

254
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,560
and leaf axles. This helps prevent water

255
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,079
from accumulating, avoiding leaf rot and

256
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,079
keeping the leaves dry and well

257
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,079
ventilated.

260
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,880
Um, after wiping the leaves, place the

261
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,880
orchid pot in a spot with gentle

262
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,559
sunlight. This helps the plant recover

263
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,600
and grow naturally without being

264
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,600
affected by harsh sunlight.

265
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,839
Use any remaining mixture to spray on

266
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,240
orchids that are currently blooming.

267
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:27,280
This helps the flowers last longer and

268
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,280

270
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,840
the orchid's resistance, allowing the

271
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,600
plant to defend against environmental

272
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,600
stressors like intense sunlight and

273
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,600
drought.

274
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,960
The nutrients in this mixture promote

275
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,880
root development, helping the orchid

276
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,880
absorb water and nutrients more

277
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,679
effectively. The GE mixture provides

278
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,679
nutrients that help the orchids leaves

279
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:01,480
grow strong, shiny, and fresh, giving

280
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,480
the plant a healthy appearance.

281
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,000
The nutrients in GE not only help the

282
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,600
current flowers last longer, but also

283
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,840
stimulate the buds that haven't bloomed

284
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,840
yet, encouraging the orchid to flower

285
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,320
continuously. Using GE fertilizer to

286
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,799
care for orchids is very beneficial, but

287
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,160
it should be done about twice a month.

288
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,240
This allows the plant to absorb

289
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,000
nutrients effectively without causing

290
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:29,440

has grown many new roots, which proves

297
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,120
that the natural fertilizer has helped

298
