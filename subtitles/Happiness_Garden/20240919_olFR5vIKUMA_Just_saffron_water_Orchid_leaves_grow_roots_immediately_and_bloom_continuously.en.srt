00:00:19,897 --> 00:00:23,896
Welcome everyone to my channel

2
00:00:24,896 --> 00:00:31,894
This is an orchid with leaf rot caused by a fungus

3
00:00:32,894 --> 00:00:40,892
We need to separate the diseased plant from other orchids

4
00:00:42,892 --> 00:00:50,890
Now I will share how to restore this rotten orchid with only 1 leaf

5
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:06,887
Cut off all damaged roots

6
00:01:12,886 --> 00:01:18,885
Cut off all rotten parts of the orchid stem

7
00:01:22,884 --> 00:01:30,882
This will help prevent the orchid stem from rotting further

8
00:01:54,878 --> 00:02:00,877
Cut off wilted branches

9
00:02:00,878 --> 00:02:06,875
Helps remove dust, mold, and insects on orchidsThis will help prevent the orchid stem from rotting furtherRinse with water

10
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:16,873
Rinse with water

11
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:25,872
Helps remove dust, mold, and insects on orchids

12
00:03:00,898 --> 00:03:06,897
This is saffron starch

13
00:03:10,896 --> 00:03:18,894
Take 3 teaspoons of saffron starch and put it in a glass

14
00:03:25,893 --> 00:03:31,892
Add 500ml of water

15
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:56,887
Wait 10 minutes for the saffron essence to completely dissolve in the water

16
00:04:02,886 --> 00:04:06,885
10 minutes later

17
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:32,880
Filter out residue

18
00:04:47,877 --> 00:04:50,876
Step 1

19
00:04:56,875 --> 00:05:02,874
Thoroughly wipe the top and bottom of the leaf

20
00:05:04,873 --> 00:05:10,872
Helps remove dirt, mold, and insects hiding on leaves that harm orchids

21
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:20,870
Saffron starch is rich in antioxidants and has antibacterial properties,

22
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:29,868
Helps orchids increase their resistance to mold, bacteria and other harmful agents. 

23
00:05:30,868 --> 00:05:38,900
This helps the plant avoid root rot or disease during growth.

24
00:05:58,896 --> 00:06:03,895
Then place the orchid roots in this glass

25
00:06:16,892 --> 00:06:19,892
Step 2

26
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:29,890
Soak orchid roots in saffron starch water for 20 minutes

27
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:37,888
Saffron starch contains natural nutrients 

28
00:06:37,888 --> 00:06:45,887
Has the ability to promote root growth and rapid germination. 

29
00:06:49,886 --> 00:06:58,884
Dissolve the remaining safaron water and add 1 liter of water

30
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:20,880
Then water each orchid pot with about 10 tablespoons of water.

31
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:28,878
Saffron provides a large amount of essential nutrients 

32
00:07:29,878 --> 00:07:36,877
helps orchids grow healthily. 

33
00:07:36,877 --> 00:07:42,875
Plants can grow faster,

34
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:50,874
Leaves and stems become strong and full of vitality.

35
00:07:52,873 --> 00:08:00,872
Fertilize orchids with this fertilizer 1-2 times/month, 

36
00:08:00,872 --> 00:08:08,870
combined with other organic fertilizers that I have shared on the channel.

37
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:15,869
will help your orchids stay healthy and full of vitality

38
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:29,899
After soaking for 20 minutes, take the orchid out and use cotton to absorb all the water from the roots

39
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:55,894
Then sprinkle saffron starch on the cut

40
00:08:55,894 --> 00:09:02,893
This helps the cut heal quickly

41
00:09:12,891 --> 00:09:20,889
At the same time, saffron starch also stimulates faster rooting

42
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:44,687
Then leave it for 1 day for the cutting to dry completely before planting

43
00:09:47,017 --> 00:09:50,883
1 Day later

44
00:10:04,217 --> 00:10:10,879
Recycle plastic bottles into orchid nursery tools

45
00:10:45,872 --> 00:10:55,870
Place a cotton ball here to help absorb water and retain moisture better

46
00:11:19,673 --> 00:11:29,897
Then place the orchid root on top of the flower and put it all in the vase

47
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:46,894
Pour in filtered water but do not let the filtered water touch the roots

48
00:11:48,693 --> 00:11:56,892
The water will seep through the cotton pad and create moisture for the orchid roots to grow

49
00:11:59,592 --> 00:12:08,889
Spray mist with water to keep orchid leaves moist once a day

50
00:12:15,888 --> 00:12:21,887
Results after 50 days

51
00:12:27,401 --> 00:12:35,884
The roots grow many new roots

52
00:12:38,243 --> 00:12:48,881
From the old orchid stem, two baby orchids have grown on both sides

53
00:12:57,355 --> 00:13:06,878
There was a small orchid that was attacked by insects and ate its leaves

54
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:30,873
I planted the orchid in a new pot so the orchid can grow in an outside environment

55
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:42,871
Planting with bark will help the roots breathe and reduce root rot

56
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:29,895
After planting orchids, water with saffron starch again

57
00:14:40,717 --> 00:14:48,891
Thank you for watching this video. Good luck and happiness in life
