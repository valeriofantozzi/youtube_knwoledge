00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:16,897
When you buy an orchid or someone gives it to you.

3
00:00:22,896 --> 00:00:32,894
You need to do the following:

4
00:00:34,894 --> 00:00:46,218
Leave the orchid in a cool place for a few hours to let it adapt to the new climate.

5
00:00:56,259 --> 00:01:06,246
If the growing medium is moss or small wood chips, it is only suitable for industrial orchid gardens.

6
00:01:07,887 --> 00:01:17,885
Because moss retains a lot of moisture, many plant roots rot due to waterlogging.

7
00:01:36,881 --> 00:01:46,879
The humidity was too high so the leaves were also infected with black mold.

8
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:15,874
Therefore, you need to remove all moss or old growing medium.

9
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:31,087
Because this type of substrate is only suitable for industrial orchid gardens that can control special humidity.

10
00:02:58,898 --> 00:03:08,896
Then you cut off all damaged roots.

11
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:46,889
and cut off all wilted flowers.

12
00:04:07,885 --> 00:04:17,883
Then you take 1 aloe vera leaf.

13
00:04:48,877 --> 00:04:58,875
And take a clove of garlic.

14
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:39,799
Put all the aloe vera and garlic in a jar and soak it with 2 liters of water.

15
00:05:50,898 --> 00:06:00,896
Wait 30 minutes for the nutrients from the garlic and aloe vera to dissolve into the water.

16
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:06,894
30 MINUTES LATER

17
00:06:28,696 --> 00:06:38,694
Soak the roots in this solution for 30 minutes.

18
00:06:41,216 --> 00:06:51,214
Garlic and aloe vera help stimulate root growth and effectively fight harmful insects and fungi

19
00:07:06,778 --> 00:07:16,776
Spraying this solution on the entire orchid will help repel insects,

20
00:07:16,776 --> 00:07:23,746
eliminate fungal diseases and keep the leaves green.

21
00:07:35,877 --> 00:07:45,875
Then clean the black mold stains with this solution.

22
00:07:56,873 --> 00:08:06,871
This helps prevent orchids from recurring mold.

23
00:08:50,895 --> 00:09:00,893
Now I recycle used plastic containers to make orchid pots.

24
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:48,451
I put a layer of pumice on the bottom of the orchid pot.

25
00:09:50,212 --> 00:10:00,077
This helps keep the bottom of the orchid pot clear so the roots don't get waterlogged.

26
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:12,879
For the top, I used dried pine bark as a growing medium.

27
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:22,877
and mix in some dry moss.

28
00:10:45,873 --> 00:10:55,871
When planting, cushion the substrate tightly so that the roots do not move.

29
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:24,965
Insert the flower branch into the right position to help prevent the orchid from shaking.

30
00:11:40,895 --> 00:11:50,893
After planting, let it dry for 5 days before watering.

31
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:58,891
