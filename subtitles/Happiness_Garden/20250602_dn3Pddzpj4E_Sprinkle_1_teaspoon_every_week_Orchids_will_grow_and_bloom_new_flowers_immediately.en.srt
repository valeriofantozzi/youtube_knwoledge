7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,359
with you a new method for uh making

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,520
natural fertilizer that is both simple

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,760
and effective, suitable for orchids and

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,680
many other types of plants using

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,960
familiar ingredients that almost every

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,960
household already has in the kitchen.

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,960
This type of fertilizer will help your

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,880
orchid grow quickly, stay healthy, and

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,440
remain vibrant with beautiful clusters

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,600
of flowers that bloom evenly and last a

18

20
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,960
right on the plant and may even bloom

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,690

00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:04,879
started. To make today's natural

26
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,960
fertilizer, I will use eggshells. A

27
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,119
simple, easy to find ingredient that is

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,360
very rich in essential nutrients for

29
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,200
plants, helping to strengthen the health

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,990
of orchids and other plants in the

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,160

[Applause]

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,040
Take about 10 eggshells and wash them

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,800
Then dry or with the eggshells on the

51
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,560
stove over low heat for about 5 minutes.

52
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,200
This step helps completely eliminate

57
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,319
on the stove for five minutes, take them

58
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,760

fertilizer making

61
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:54,800
process. Next, use a mortar and pestle

62
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,519
to crush the eggshells into small

63
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,840
pieces, making the fertilizer easier to

64
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,440
dissolve and allowing the plants to

65
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,550
absorb the nutrients in the eggshells

66
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,749
better.

the eggshells blend and work best when

74
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,920
applied to the plants.

[Music]

76
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,200
Then pour about 100 mm of white vinegar

77
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,120
into the jar to help dissolve the

78
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,680
minerals in the crushed eggshells and

79
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,680
stimulate the decomposition process,

80
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,480
creating a natural fertilizer rich in

81
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,480
nutrients for the plants.

82
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,079
You close the jar lid and observe the

83
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,320
reaction process between the eggshells

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,320
and the

85
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,759
vinegar. When you see bubbling and foam

86
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,520
appear, that is a sign that the the

87
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,220
minerals are dissolving and breaking

88
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:37,490

90
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,160
Then let the mixture ferment overnight

97
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,720
prepare some clean water to dilute the

98
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,960
fertilizer before use. This helps reduce

99
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,840
the acidity and ensures it's safe for

100
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,840
the plant roots when

101
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:15,320
watering. Prepare two cups, each

102
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,320
containing one liter of clean water.

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,639
eggshell and white vinegar solution into

106
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,160
each liter of water. This ratio provides

107
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,160
just the right amount of nutrients for

108
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,160

Then I proceed to treat the pine bark

113
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,360
before planting to eliminate fungi and

114
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,600
impurities while also making the bark

115
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,940
safer and more suitable as a growing

116
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:58,000

118
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,240
Pour the diluted fertilizer mixture over

119
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,560
the pine bark and moss to soak them for

120
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,880
about 20 minutes before planting. This

121
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,560
helps with light sterilization, adds

122
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,800
initial nutrients, and softens the

123
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,800
materials, creating an ideal environment

124
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,800
for orchid roots to attach and grow

126
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,360
Now I prepare a healthy small orchid to

127
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,360
repot into a new pot.

128
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,960
You need to remove the old moss or

129
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,199
orchid growing foam before planting

130
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,840
because these mediums retain water very

131
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,840
well, but can easily cause root rot when

132
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,880
transferring to a larger pot, negatively

133
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,880

136
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,280
medium, we need to cut off any rotten

137
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,280
and weak roots.

138
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,479
This helps remove parts that can no

longer absorb nutrients while also

140
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,800
stimulating the plant to focus on

141
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:22,759
growing new, healthier roots, ensuring

142
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,759
good growth in the new pot.

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,159
Then soak the orchid roots in the

diluted fertilizer mixture for about 20

147
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,160

149
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,560
absorb nutrients and promotes quick

194
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:17,320
leftover fertilizer into a spray bottle

195
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,320

[Music]

197
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,760
You can use a spray bottle to mist the

198
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,600
orchids that are blooming. This is very

199
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,360
beneficial as it directly supplies

200
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,360
nutrients through the leaves, helping

201
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,720
the flowers stay fresh longer and

202
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,510
keeping the plants healthier throughout

203
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,649
the blooming season.

[Music]

206
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,600
The fertilizer will provide ample

207
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,440
calcium and essential minerals, helping

208
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,839
to strengthen the cellular structure of

209
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,959
the orchid flowers. This makes the

210
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:59,040
petals firmer, more vibrant, and extends

211
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:03,639
the blooming period, allowing you to

212
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,639
enjoy their brilliant beauty for longer.

213
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,600
Um, when sprayed directly onto the

214
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,079
leaves, the fertilizer quickly

215
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,279
supplements nutrients, enhances the

216
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,320
plant's photosynthesis capacity and

217
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:20,079
resistance, helping the orchid better

218
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,399
withstand changing weather conditions

219
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,399
and

220
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,680
pests. After spraying the fertilizer,

221
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,160
remember to gently wipe off any water

222
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:34,200
droplets on the surface and crevices of

223
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,200
the leaves with a soft cloth.

224
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,880
This helps prevent uh prolonged moisture

225
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,040
buildup, reduces the risk of fungal

226
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,600
infections, and keeps the orchid leaves

227
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,600
dry and

228
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,900

229
00:13:55,959 --> 00:14:00,480
healthy. After a week without watering

230
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,740
to allow the plant to stabilize, we

231
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:08,970
begin fertilizing the orchid.

232
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:08,970
[Music]

233
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,160
I use rice water to care for

234
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,320
orchids. Use a soft cloth soaked in the

235
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,440
rice water mixture to gently wipe the

236
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,440
surface of the orchid leaves clean.

237
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,519
This method helps remove dust, provides

238
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,440
nutrients, and keeps the leaves shiny

239
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,060
and healthy, contributing to enhancing

240
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:38,440
the plant's photosynthesis

241
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,440
[Music]

242
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,519
capacity. Then use the diluted rice

243
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:47,560
water to water directly onto the roots

244
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,560
and growing medium of the orchid.

245
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,880
Uh, it's best to alternate between

246
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,240
different types of natural fertilizers

247
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,240
for your orchids every 2

248
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,279
weeks. This method helps provide the

249
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,240
plant with a full range of diverse

250
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:04,320
nutrients, avoiding nutrient excess or

251
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,000
deficiency while maintaining balanced

252
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,360
and sustainable

253
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,600
growth. After that, remember to place

254
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,360
the orchid pot in a spot with gentle

255
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,540
sunlight so the orchid can

256
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,900
photosynthesize optimally.

And here is the result after 3 months of

259
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:28,240
care. Um, you can see the orchid leaves

260
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,480
