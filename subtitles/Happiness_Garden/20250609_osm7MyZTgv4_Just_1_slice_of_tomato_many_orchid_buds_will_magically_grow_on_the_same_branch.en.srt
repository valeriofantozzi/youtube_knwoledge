00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,120
When growing orchids, everyone wants the

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,280
flowers to bloom for a long time, right?

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,560
And each orchid pot will bloom a lot of

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,840
flowers all year round.

Now, let's get started.

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,120
And when the flowers have all bloomed, I

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,780
cut off all the places that are no

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:59,120

Then, sprinkle white cement on the cut

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,479
to help the wound dry faster, limit

27
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,080
bacteria and fungi from entering,

28
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,640

31
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,880
Unflowered nodes like this will have the

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,570
potential to sprout buds or flower buds.

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,440
I peel off the protective film that will

38
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,640
Then I took the tomatoes to make natural

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:16,000
fertilizer for the orchids.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,440
Take a slice of tomato like this.

42
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,680
Tomatoes contain a lot of vitamin A,

43
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,680
vitamin C, and are rich in potassium,

44
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,160
calcium, and phosphorus, which are very

45
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,239
good for orchids. Therefore, when caring

46
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,800
for orchids with tomatoes, orchids will

47
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,800
grow very quickly.

Method one. Then gently wipe the leaves

62
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,319
to clean and nourish the plant.

63
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,920
Then using cotton soaked in tomato

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,239
mixture and wrapping it around the

65
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,750

81
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,040
On normal days, you just need to use

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,320
regular water to keep the flower

00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:11,639

minerals that can help make the leaves

89
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,000

every two weeks.

111
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,520
Orchids grow because nutrients are

transported from the roots to all parts

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,479

stock furthest from the roots.

115
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,800
Before fertilizing, water the orchid

116
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,390

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:30,590
Then you cut off all damaged roots.

196
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:47,909

197
00:12:49,839 --> 00:13:20,800
and cut off all wilted flowers.

198
00:12:54,060 --> 00:13:24,240
[Music]

199
00:13:20,800 --> 00:14:01,839
Then you take one aloe vera leaf.

200
00:13:24,240 --> 00:14:04,580
[Music]

201
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:16,200
and take a clove of garlic.

202
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:16,200
[Music]

203
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:22,039

[Music]

205
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,230
Put all the aloe vera and garlic in a

206
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:52,919
jar and soak it with 2 L of water.

207
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:52,919
[Music]

208
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,369
[Music]

209
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,760
Wait 30 minutes for the nutrients from

210
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,160
the garlic and aloe vera to dissolve

211
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,160
into the water.

212
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:18,780
[Music]

213
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:35,200
30 minutes later,

214
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:35,200
[Music]

215
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,839
Soak the roots in this solution for 30

216
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,839
minutes.

217
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,190
[Music]

218
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,440
Garlic and aloe vera help stimulate root

219
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,240
growth and effectively fight harmful

220
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,240
insects and fungi.

221
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:21,920
[Music]

222
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,839
Um, spraying this solution on the entire

223
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,519
orchid will help repel insects,

224
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,780
eliminate fungal diseases, and keep the

225
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:31,669
leaves green.

226
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:31,669
[Music]

227
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:45,349
[Music]

228
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,639
Then clean the black mold stains with

229
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,639
this solution.

230
00:16:54,530 --> 00:17:09,759
[Music]

231
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,079
This helps prevent orchids from

232
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,079
recurring mold.

233
00:17:15,390 --> 00:18:06,080
[Music]

234
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:09,640
Now I recycle used plastic containers to

235
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,640
make orchid pots.

236
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:54,400
[Music]

237
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:58,039
I put a layer of pummus on the bottom of

238
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,039
the orchid pot.

239
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:05,919
[Music]

240
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
This helps keep the bottom of the orchid

241
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,130
pot clear so the roots don't get water

242
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:15,840
logged.

243
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:18,320
[Music]

244
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,240
For the top, I use dried pine bark as a

245
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:24,640
growing medium

246
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,640
[Music]

247
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,880
and mix in some dry moss.

248
00:19:45,290 --> 00:20:00,960
[Music]

249
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:05,880
When planting, cushion the substrate

250
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,880
tightly so that the roots do not move.

251
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:29,840
[Music]

252
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,919
Insert the flower branch into the right

253
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,440
position to help prevent the orchid from

254
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:53,809
shaking.

255
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:53,809
[Music]

256
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,030
After planting, let it dry for 5 days

257
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:04,880
before watering.

258
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:06,480
[Music]

259
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,559
Take care of your orchids with all the

260
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:13,159
love you have for plants and they will

261
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,159
bloom all over the garden this way.

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,369

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:24,919

264
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,919
