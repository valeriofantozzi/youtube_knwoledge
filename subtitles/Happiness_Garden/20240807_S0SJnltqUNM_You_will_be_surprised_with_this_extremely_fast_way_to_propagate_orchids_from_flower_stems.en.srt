Welcome to my channel

2
00:00:22,896 --> 00:00:27,895
Today I share how to propagate orchids from flower stalks using a new, very easy method

3
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:33,894
so that you have many different ways to choose from for propagating orchids.

4
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:06,887
Pry off the membrane so the sprouts can grow easily

5
00:01:09,887 --> 00:01:13,886
Use about 10g of onion

6
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:54,878
Squeeze the onion juice

7
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,869
Wait 5 minutes for the onion juice to penetrate the orchid

8
00:02:42,868 --> 00:02:44,868
AFTER 5 MINUTES

9
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,899
Wait for the cut to dry

10
00:03:03,897 --> 00:03:08,896
Use tree bark glue (TREE SEAS)

11
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:14,895
Apply it on the cut to keep it from drying out

12
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:20,894
and keep orchids from rotting.

13
00:03:20,894 --> 00:03:25,893
WAIT FOR THE GLUE TO DRY

14
00:03:27,893 --> 00:03:35,891
Use 1 teaspoon of cinnamon bark powder

15
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:42,890
Add 60ml boiled water

16
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:52,888
Wait for the water to cool

17
00:04:23,881 --> 00:04:28,880
Soak the moss in this cinnamon water for about 20 minutes

18
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:36,879
Cinnamon juice has very good antiseptic properties

19
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:03,873
After 20 minutes soak in cinnamon water

20
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:26,869
I use recycled plastic bottles to make orchid care tools

21
00:05:51,897 --> 00:05:57,896
Insert the branch and point the sprout upward

22
00:05:57,896 --> 00:06:06,894
and spray regularly with moisturizing water

23
00:06:14,893 --> 00:06:19,892
PUT IN A COOL LOCATION

24
00:06:20,892 --> 00:06:28,890
and spray water to moisturize

25
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:34,889
AFTER 3 WEEKS

26
00:06:47,886 --> 00:06:55,885
Sprouts have grown

27
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,880
Regularly mist to moisturize

28
00:07:28,878 --> 00:07:33,877
CONTINUE INSTALLATION IN A COOL PLACE

29
00:07:40,876 --> 00:07:48,874
AFTER 3 MONTHS

30
00:07:48,874 --> 00:07:55,873
The small orchid has grown very well

31
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:10,870
Roots develop very well

32
00:08:40,897 --> 00:08:50,895
Reuse recycled plastic bottles to grow orchids

33
00:09:27,888 --> 00:09:36,886
With this planting method, orchids will grow very quickly

34
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:59,881
Because orchids always have appropriate humidity

35
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,879
