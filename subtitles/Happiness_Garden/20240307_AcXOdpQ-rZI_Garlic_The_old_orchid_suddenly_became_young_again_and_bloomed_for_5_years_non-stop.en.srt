Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:41,814 --> 00:00:51,790
If you have an orchid with wilted and rotten leaves like this.

3
00:00:54,657 --> 00:01:04,654
Cut off all wilted leaves and damaged roots.

4
00:02:16,065 --> 00:02:26,038
Leave for 1 day without watering so that the cut heals quickly.

5
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:49,100
Then take 2 cloves of garlic.

6
00:03:30,561 --> 00:03:40,557
and take about 20 grams of aloe vera leaves.

7
00:04:04,325 --> 00:04:12,317
Add 1 liter of water at room temperature.

8
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:22,882
and wait 1 day before using.

9
00:04:31,518 --> 00:04:35,513
1 day later.

10
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:15,405
Cleaning the leaves with this water helps eliminate fungal diseases and insects.

11
00:05:51,082 --> 00:06:01,895
Spraying this water on the entire orchid helps kill mold, insects and adds necessary nutrients.

12
00:06:07,894 --> 00:06:16,893
Helps orchids increase resistance and stimulate growth.

13
00:06:20,225 --> 00:06:30,223
Then you use this water to water the orchid roots.

14
00:06:32,989 --> 00:06:40,988
Soaking in this water for 5 minutes helps kill fungal diseases on the orchid growing medium.

15
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:57,884
Recycle plastic bottles into orchid rooting tools.

16
00:07:54,929 --> 00:08:04,904
Add sterilized dry moss here.

17
00:08:31,157 --> 00:08:40,131
Then regularly water and keep moist to stimulate root growth..

18
00:08:44,462 --> 00:08:54,428
I usually water every 3 days.

19
00:09:02,226 --> 00:09:12,224
and spraying moisturizing mist with water helps leaves stay fresh and recover quickly.

20
00:09:23,408 --> 00:09:33,387
Place in a cool place with enough light for the orchids to photosynthesize.

21
00:09:40,574 --> 00:09:45,551
1 month later.

22
00:09:51,092 --> 00:10:00,082
The orchid leaf has gotten stronger and has grown a new leaf at the top.

23
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:22,877
This method stimulates the root system to develop very well.

24
00:11:33,464 --> 00:11:43,461
Apply toothpaste to the cut to help it heal quickly and prevent tooth decay.

25
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:19,409
I also apply the same method to this orchid.

26
00:13:19,409 --> 00:13:29,353
The lower stem has been rejuvenated and the baby orchid has been revived

27
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:44,104
The top has grown very healthy and has many flower buds.

28
00:13:44,104 --> 00:13:56,102
