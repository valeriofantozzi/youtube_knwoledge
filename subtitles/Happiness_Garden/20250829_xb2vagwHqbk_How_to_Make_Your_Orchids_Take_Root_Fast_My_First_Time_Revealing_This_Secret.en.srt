Hello everyone. I hope you are having a

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,520
wonderful day and are ready to spend

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,000
some time relaxing beside the beautiful

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,000
orchid pots.

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,040
This orchid is having a problem with

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,520
yellow leaves. The cause is often

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,320
insects sucking the plant sap creating

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,119
small wounds and then fungi and bacteria

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,119
enter through those wounds.

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,000
When the plant encounters this disease,

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,719
the leaves, although still turgid, fall

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,719
off very quickly.

13
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,800
You can see that the entire orchid has

14
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,840
only one healthy leaf left, while all

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,840
the other leaves have been infected.

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,440
If not treated promptly, the spots on

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,120
the leaves will quickly spread and cause

18
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,120
the orchid to become severely weakened.

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,719
I cut here to check the inside of the

20
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,719
stem to see how far the disease has

21
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,719
spread.

00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,850
I will remove all the infected leaves to

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,720
This spot is exactly where the fungi

32
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,119
reside, so it needs to be removed to

42
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,610

After about 10 minutes, when the

61
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,640
Then use a soft cloth to soak up the

62
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,519
solution and gently wipe the leaves and

63
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,519
stem of the orchid thoroughly.

64
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,680
The cement water will create a

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,480
protective layer on the cut, preventing

66
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,080
fungi and bacteria from entering. As a

67
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,760
result, the orchid is effectively

68
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,760
protected against stem and leaf rot.

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,680
Then gently wash the orchid in this

Now scoop this solution and pour it

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,280
directly onto the orchid's stem in the

76
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,600
pot while also soaking the entire

77
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,600
growing medium.

78
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,759
During the watering process, you should

79
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,000
also take the opportunity to wash the

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,560
cut on the stem with this and with this

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,880

82
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,720

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,720

Then soak the entire orchid pot in this

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,840
solution for about 10 minutes so that

87
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,570

I also soak the moss in this solution

provide calcium and important nutrients

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,199
Eggshells also help increase slight
