Welcome to my

00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:04,930
channel. When you buy an orchid or

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,880
someone gives it to

4
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:10,600
[Music]

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:14,430
you. You need to do the

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,430
[Music]

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,359
following. First, you need to remove the

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,359
packaging from the

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,920
[Music]

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,840
orchid. Next, leave the orchid in a cool

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,930
place for a few hours to allow it to

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:39,649
adjust to the new climate.

13
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:39,649
[Music]

14
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,800
Uh if the growing medium is moss or

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,920
small wood chips, it is only suitable

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,920
for industrial orchid gardens.

17
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:05,150
[Music]

18
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:08,000
[Applause]

19
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:10,320
[Music]

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Because moss retains a lot of moisture,

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,000
many plant roots rot due to water

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
logging.

23
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,119

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,280

[Music]

28
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,960
along. Uh the humidity was too high, so

29
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,960
the leaves were also infected with black

30
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,960
mold.

31
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,280
In addition to the English dub, we've

32
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,000
now created dubs in French, German,

33
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,320
Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese,

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,880
Hindi, and Indonesian to help you hear

00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:05,000

[Music]

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,879
easily. Therefore, you need to remove

38
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,879
all moss or old growing medium.

39
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,080
Um because this type of substrate is

40
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,060
only suitable for industrial orchid

41
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:35,959
gardens that can control special

42
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:38,400

00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:40,720
humidity. Please comment to me which

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,239
country you are watching the video from.

45
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,870
It's It's great that we can chat

46
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:53,860

48
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,490
world. Then you cut off all damaged

49
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:17,590
roots.

50
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:17,590

52
00:03:36,799 --> 00:04:07,760
and cut off all wilted flowers.

53
00:03:41,060 --> 00:04:11,240
[Music]

54
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:48,880
Then you take one aloe vera leaf.

55
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:51,580
[Music]

56
00:04:48,880 --> 00:05:03,199
and take a clove of garlic.

57
00:04:51,580 --> 00:05:03,199

00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,040

[Music]

60
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,230
Put all the aloe vera and garlic in a

61
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:39,920
jar and soak it with 2 L of water.

62
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:39,920
[Music]

63
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,369
[Music]

64
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,800
Wait 30 minutes for the nutrients from

65
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,150
the garlic and aloe vera to dissolve

66
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:01,830
into the

67
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:01,830

68
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:22,199
water. 30 minutes later.

69
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:22,199
[Music]

70
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,880
Soak the roots in this solution for 30

71
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,880
minutes.

72
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,479
Garlic and aloe vera help stimulate root

73
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,280
growth and effectively fight harmful

74
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,280
insects and fungi.

75
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:08,960
[Music]

76
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,880
Um, spraying this solution on the entire

77
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,560
orchid will help repel insects,

78
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,780
eliminate fungal diseases, and keep the

79
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,670
leaves green.

80
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,670
[Music]

81
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:32,350
[Music]

82
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,599
Then clean the black mold stains with

83
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,599
this

84
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:58,400
[Music]

85
00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:02,039
solution. This helps prevent orchids

86
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,039
from recurring mold.

87
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:53,040
[Music]

88
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,600
Now I recycle used plastic containers to

89
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,600
make orchid pots.

90
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:22,360
[Music]

91
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,360
Hey, hey, hey.

92
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:41,360
[Music]

93
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:45,000
I put a layer of pummus on the bottom of

94
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,000
the orchid pot.

95
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,760
[Music]

96
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,130
This helps keep the bottom of the orchid

97
00:09:52,880 --> 00:10:01,880
pot clear so the roots don't get water

98
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:04,720
[Music]

99
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:07,600
logged. For the top, I use dried pine

100
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,600
bark as a growing

101
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,639
[Music]

102
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,920
medium and mix in some dry moss.

103
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:48,000
[Music]

104
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:52,839
When planting, cushion the substrate

105
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,839
tightly so that the roots do not move.

106
00:10:53,740 --> 00:11:16,800
[Music]

107
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,880
Insert the flower branch into the right

108
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,440
position to help prevent the orchid from

109
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:40,809
shaking.

110
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:40,809
[Music]

111
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,030
After planting, let it dry for 5 days

112
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:50,740
before

113
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:50,740

114
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,120
watering. Take care of your orchids with

all the love you have for plants, and

116
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,120
they will bloom all over the garden this

117
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,120
way.
