Welcome to my Happiness Garden channel

00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:13,898
Cattleya is an orchid with bright colors and an attractive scent, so it is loved by many people around the world.

3
00:00:15,964 --> 00:00:22,896
In this video, I share how to make them reproduce quickly.

4
00:00:23,896 --> 00:00:31,894
This is a pot of Cattleya orchids.

5
00:00:32,894 --> 00:00:40,892
Includes 6 barren pseudobulbs.

6
00:00:43,892 --> 00:00:55,889
First you need to cut off all damaged roots.

7
00:01:03,462 --> 00:01:13,886
I then inserted these bars to stabilize the orchid so it wouldn't shake.

8
00:01:35,882 --> 00:01:45,880
Then use scissors to separate each pseudobulb.

9
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:54,878
This helps the orchid grow many new pseudobulbs.

10
00:01:56,955 --> 00:02:06,875
Then leave it in a cool place for 1 week without watering to let the wound heal itself.

11
00:02:16,873 --> 00:02:20,873
a week later

12
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:28,871
Take 5 spoons of rice.

13
00:02:31,657 --> 00:02:40,869
Add 2 liters of warm water.

14
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:54,899
Then add 1 teaspoon of turmeric powder.

15
00:02:56,358 --> 00:03:06,897
Soak rice and turmeric starch for 30 minutes.

16
00:03:14,056 --> 00:03:19,028
30 Minutes later.

17
00:03:53,158 --> 00:04:03,886
Then you use this rice water mixed with turmeric powder to water the orchid roots.

18
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:16,883
Rice water contains some basic nutrients such as nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus,

19
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:26,881
like a natural fertilizer to provide nutrients to plants.

20
00:04:28,992 --> 00:04:38,879
You can soak the orchid pot for 20 minutes.

21
00:04:45,488 --> 00:04:55,875
Next, use this water to thoroughly wipe both sides of the orchid leaves.

22
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:08,873
Turmeric starch contains antioxidants and has antibacterial effects.

23
00:05:11,986 --> 00:05:21,870
Helps eliminate fungi, bacteria, and insects that harm orchids

24
00:05:27,604 --> 00:05:36,867
Apply 2-3 times per month with the above 2 methods.

25
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:46,898
2 weeks later.

26
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:58,896
The sprouts begin to sprout.

27
00:06:28,231 --> 00:06:38,888
I continue to fertilize the orchids with fertilizer from rice water and turmeric starch.

28
00:06:48,886 --> 00:06:57,884
Fertilize 2-3 times/month with this type of fertilizer. On weekdays you just need to water to keep it moist.

29
00:07:22,682 --> 00:07:26,879
2 Months later.

30
00:07:28,576 --> 00:07:38,876
 
The sprouts have grown healthily.

31
00:07:42,735 --> 00:07:52,874
There are 6 sprouts in total.

32
00:07:58,021 --> 00:08:08,870
Normally, if you do not apply the method I just shared, the orchid will only grow 1-2 sprouts.

33
00:08:14,551 --> 00:08:26,900
Now I plant orchids in larger pots so they can grow stronger.

34
00:08:42,275 --> 00:08:50,895
Continue applying this fertilizer.

35
00:09:05,762 --> 00:09:09,892
One year later.

36
00:09:14,727 --> 00:09:25,888
I have a giant pot of orchids.

37
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:35,886
