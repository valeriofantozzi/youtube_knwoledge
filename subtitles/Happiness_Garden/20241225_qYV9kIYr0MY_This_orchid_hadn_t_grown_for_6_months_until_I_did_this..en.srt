00:00:03,209 --> 00:00:05,828
Today, we will explore how to care for weak orchids, 

3
00:00:05,828 --> 00:00:10,555
helping them recover strongly from roots to leaves and bloom beautifully.

00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,423
You can see that this orchid hasn't grown for six months.

6
00:00:24,423 --> 00:00:30,593
 Its leaves are gradually wilting, the roots are rotting, and the plant is on the brink of dying.

7
00:00:37,793 --> 00:00:45,292
Have you ever encountered a similar situation and didn't know what to do to save your beloved orchid?

8
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:52,134
First, I’ll carefully remove all the wilted and damaged leaves. 

9
00:00:52,134 --> 00:01:03,581
This is important because unhealthy leaves can drain the plant's energy, hindering its recovery and growth.

10
00:01:08,378 --> 00:01:17,568
Next, I’ll cut off all the damaged roots. This is essential because rotten roots can spread decay to healthy parts of the plant,

11
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:26,905
 preventing it from absorbing nutrients properly.

12
00:01:36,424 --> 00:01:43,560
Finally, I’ll cut off any old flower stems if present. 

13
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:55,538
This helps the plant focus its energy on new growth rather than wasting resources on fading flowers.

14
00:02:03,589 --> 00:02:12,541
Then, I’ll rinse the orchid thoroughly with water to remove any remaining dirt or contaminants that could harm the plant.

15

16
00:02:36,898 --> 00:02:45,941
It's amazing that we can connect with each other from all around the world.

17
00:02:50,935 --> 00:02:57,630
Then, I’ll place the orchid into an empty jar.

18
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:16,895
Now, I'll add 1 liter of water into the jar.

19
00:03:28,485 --> 00:03:35,327
Next, I’ll add 1 teaspoon of baking soda to the water and mix it well.

20
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:49,634
Baking soda helps prevent mold and bacterial diseases on orchids.

21
00:03:52,035 --> 00:03:55,433
Then, I’ll pour the baking soda mixture into the jar 

22
00:03:55,433 --> 00:04:05,224
and soak the orchid in it for 10 minutes to disinfect the roots and eliminate harmful mold and bacteria.

23
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:17,603
This helps the orchid recover quickly, prevent the recurrence of diseases, and promote the plant's growth.

24
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:27,068
Next, I’ll take 3 teaspoons of rice to make natural fertilizer for the orchid.

25
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:37,974
Add it to 1 liter of water.

26
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:47,177
Rice water contains vitamins and minerals that stimulate root development and improve the health of wilted orchids.

27
00:04:52,702 --> 00:05:00,000
After rinsing the rice, you can let the rice water ferment overnight to create beneficial bacteria for the orchid.

28
00:05:06,275 --> 00:05:10,933
After soaking the orchid in the baking soda solution for 10 minutes, 

29
00:05:10,933 --> 00:05:14,629
gently remove the plant and pat it dry with a soft cloth. 

30
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:19,265
This helps remove any residual solution, prevents mold and bacteria growth, 

31
00:05:19,265 --> 00:05:26,031
and allows the orchid to recover quickly and healthily.

32
00:05:52,495 --> 00:06:00,000
Then, let it sit to allow the cut to heal completely.

33
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:15,258
This is moss for planting orchids. I put it into the jar.

34
00:06:21,435 --> 00:06:29,011
Then, pour the baking soda mixture into the jar to soak the moss.

35
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:36,584
Soaking the moss before planting orchids helps eliminate harmful bacteria and mold, 

36
00:06:36,584 --> 00:06:43,488
while providing a clean and safe environment for the orchid's roots to thrive.

37
00:06:44,296 --> 00:06:49,390
I soak it overnight before using it to plant the orchids.

38
00:06:55,851 --> 00:07:03,648
After one night, I take the orchid and place the roots into the cup like this.

39
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:30,644
Then, strain out the residue and keep the rice water to make a liquid fertilizer, which is very beneficial for orchids.

40
00:07:48,673 --> 00:07:54,048
Then, soak the orchid roots in the rice water for 20 minutes. 

41
00:07:54,048 --> 00:07:59,129
This helps stimulate rapid root growth because the rice water is rich in nutrients 

42
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:06,118
and beneficial microorganisms that promote root development.

43
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:38,618
While waiting, I take a soft cotton pad, soak it in the rice water, healthy growth.

44
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:45,430
and gently wipe the leaves to help revive wilted leaves because the rice water nourishes 

45
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:51,275
and moisturizes the leaves, promoting recovery and

47
00:09:32,562 --> 00:09:44,393
After soaking for 20 minutes, take the orchid out and plant it immediately into the new pot.

48
00:09:58,901 --> 00:10:03,836
Take the moss that has been soaked in the baking soda solution, 

49
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:10,972
wring out the excess water, and then use it to plant the orchid.

50
00:10:32,229 --> 00:10:41,858
Planting orchids with soaked moss helps the wilted orchid quickly grow roots because moss has good moisture retention, 

51
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:47,379
providing an ideal environment for strong root development. 

52
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:55,688
Additionally, moss retains nutrients from the soaking solution, aiding the plant in recovery and rapid growth.

53
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:22,026
After that, water the orchid with rice water once every 10 days to help it recover quickly.

54
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:51,667
After watering, remember to place the orchid pot in a spot with gentle sunlight so the 

55
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:57,300
plant can photosynthesize and improve its metabolic processes.

56
00:11:58,354 --> 00:12:01,528
The results after 3 weeks.

57
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:10,122
As you can see, the wilted leaves have become greener, shinier, and a bit sturdier.

58
00:12:13,762 --> 00:12:22,805
The orchid has also grown a new, healthy leaf that looks very strong.

59
00:12:24,987 --> 00:12:32,563
The orchid has developed numerous new roots, which efficiently absorb water and nutrients.

60
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:48,484
This helps speed up the recovery process and helps the wilted plant recover faster.

You can see that the orchid has almost fully recovered, with the leaves becoming healthy and strong.

74
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:27,300
And the orchid has even grown a new flower spike that is very healthy.

75
00:16:30,592 --> 00:16:41,102
With this simple care routine, the orchid has quickly recovered and bloomed beautifully, just like any other healthy orchid.

76
00:16:51,435 --> 00:16:58,717
This natural fertilizer not only supports the recovery process of your beloved orchid but also helps

77
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:08,053
 the flowers bloom more vibrantly, last longer, and stay in bloom for up to 6 months before wilting.

78
00:17:11,534 --> 00:17:18,376
