00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:12,898
In this video, I share tips on recycling organic waste to make great fertilizer for orchids.

3
00:00:18,897 --> 00:00:28,895
We will not have to spend money on fertilizer and the orchids will still grow healthily.

4
00:00:33,894 --> 00:00:43,892
Orchids grow many flowers.

5
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:52,024
Flowers bloom continuously from one wave to another.

6
00:00:55,889 --> 00:01:05,887
To make this fertilizer I will recycle fish bones into fertilizer.

7
00:01:15,885 --> 00:01:25,883
Tumble dry on low heat for 10 minutes.

8
00:01:54,878 --> 00:02:04,876
pulverize.

9
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:16,873
Take 1 spoon of fish bone powder.

10
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:26,871
2 liters of hot water.

11
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:33,870
Wait for the water to cool.

12
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:48,867
rice 5 spoons.

13
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:59,898
2 liters of water.

14
00:02:59,898 --> 00:03:06,920
Wait 1 hour.

15
00:03:18,653 --> 00:03:22,894
1 Hour later.

16
00:03:36,298 --> 00:03:46,889
Filter out residue.

17
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:26,881
FIRST METHOD.

18
00:04:29,912 --> 00:04:39,878
Fertilize the orchid pot with fish bones and rice water.

19
00:04:49,335 --> 00:04:59,874
Fish bones are a rich source of natural phosphorus.

20
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:16,871
Phosphorus is one of three important nutritional elements for orchid growth.

21
00:05:22,179 --> 00:05:32,868
It helps create many important cell types, such as energy cells and nutrient transport cells.

22
00:05:39,858 --> 00:05:49,898
Calcium in fish bones helps create strong orchid cell structures,

23
00:05:55,335 --> 00:06:05,895
especially in forming and maintaining the structure of leaves and flowers.

24
00:06:14,564 --> 00:06:26,891
 
Soaking this fertilizer for about 10-20 minutes and then lifting the orchid pot out will be better.

25
00:06:32,678 --> 00:06:42,887
Do this 1-2 times a month to supplement nutrients for orchids.

26
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:55,885
SECOND METHOD.

27
00:06:59,612 --> 00:07:09,882
Spray this fertilizer on the entire orchid.

28
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:26,879
Rice is rich in potassium, Potassium helps balance water in plants,

29
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:36,877
Increases plants' ability to tolerate water shortages and improves plants' ability to respond to environmental stresses.

30
00:07:41,888 --> 00:07:51,874
Rice also provides some minerals and organic substances such as amino acids, which can be helpful for orchid growth.

31
00:08:00,628 --> 00:08:03,871
RESULT.

32
00:08:05,495 --> 00:08:15,869
After 2 months, the roots grow very healthy, helping the orchid absorb the most nutrients.

33
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:51,895
Many buds develop.

34
00:08:51,895 --> 00:08:58,443
New sprouts are very strong and grow quickly.

35
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:10,891
bloom many flowers.

36
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:26,888
The flower color is more vibrant than usual.

37
00:09:32,027 --> 00:09:42,019
The flowers stay on the branches for a long time before fading.

38
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:52,083
