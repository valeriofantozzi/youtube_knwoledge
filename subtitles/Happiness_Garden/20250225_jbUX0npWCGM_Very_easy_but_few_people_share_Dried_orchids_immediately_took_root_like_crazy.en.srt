fast when I just bought orchids we

234
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,080
remove all this

235
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,360
Moss uh because these Orchid pots are

236
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,840
grown in an industrial environment

237
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:30,760
controlled by temperature humidity and

238
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,760
uh ideal for orchid

239
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,360
but when brought back the environment

240
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,440
has changed making these roots

241
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:40,320
susceptible to rot therefore you should

242
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,320
cut off damaged

243
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,600

285
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:12,279

[Music]

291
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,360
in put terracotta seeds around the

292
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:50,400
pot grown in a semi-hydroponic

293
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,520
environment often in contact with water

294
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,679
so we use breathable terracotta beads as

295
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,679
the best

297
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,279

rotten and after planting The Roots will

299
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:10,880

311
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,490
let the water level cover part of the

315
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,720
to maintain the moisture in the growing

316
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:19,919

00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:22,000
[Music]

318
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,240
anymore when the water in the container

319
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,100
is empty remember to add more water to

320
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:31,159
keep the growing medium in a moist state

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,640
quickly a strong root system will help

337
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:30,120
the plant perform metabolism and absorb

338
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,120
organic fertilizer and water very well

339
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:36,120
