Now let's get started

11
00:01:04,406 --> 00:01:06,876
How to make fertilizer

12
00:01:09,014 --> 00:01:16,985
This is garlic powder that has been dried and crushed

13
00:01:18,321 --> 00:01:24,835
use 1 teaspoon of garlic powder

14
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:30,629
Add 1 liter of boiling water

15
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:36,057
then wait for the water to cool

16
00:01:36,974 --> 00:01:43,300
After the water cools

17
00:01:49,431 --> 00:02:00,741
Filter the water in the upper part

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,900
The scum below we remove

19
00:02:29,276 --> 00:02:35,270
1. Clean the leaves

20
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:47,415
Use a cotton ball soaked in garlic juice to wipe the upper and lower eyes of the leaves

21
00:02:47,415 --> 00:02:59,193
Garlic juice has antiseptic properties that will help get rid of the fungus

22
00:02:59,193 --> 00:03:08,533
and get rid of insects like aphids, red spiders, insects

23
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:17,558
This also causes the stomata in the leaves to open

24
00:03:17,558 --> 00:03:25,788
help orchids photosynthesize well

25
00:03:32,544 --> 00:03:54,198
Regularly wipe, the orchid leaves will be green like this

26
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:26,625
2. Mist moisturizing

27
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:36,579
Spray on front, back and base of orchids

28
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:48,113
This is like using foliar fertilizer

29
00:04:48,113 --> 00:05:02,883
Helps orchids grow and increase resistance to fungal diseases

30
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:13,228
3. Irrigate this liquid fertilizer for orchids

31
00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:24,374
Water each orchid 5-6 tablespoons of this garlic-based fertilizer

32
00:05:24,374 --> 00:05:35,690
Just 2 times a month combined with other organic fertilizers that I have shared

33
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:46,899
Will help orchids grow, increase disease resistance

34
00:05:46,899 --> 00:06:06,495
Because orchids contain many natural vitamins and minerals such as nitrogen, 

35
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:15,687
phosphorus, and potassium

36
00:06:15,687 --> 00:06:25,970
When irrigated with fertilizer from garlic, 

37
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:34,904
it will help orchids absorb nutrients more easily

38
00:06:34,904 --> 00:06:45,001
Fertilizer from garlic is very good but should not be overused

39
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:53,336
should only be used as my guide

40
00:06:54,685 --> 00:07:04,208
Now look at the orchids after being cared for with garlic water

41
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:18,998
The roots are protected, so they grow very well

42
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:39,486
a lot of new roots grow after 2 weeks of use

43
00:07:49,848 --> 00:07:59,233
Many flower buds grow on the same branch

44
00:07:59,233 --> 00:08:04,105
