00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:16,897
I just picked up a rotten orchid because people threw it away.

3
00:00:33,894 --> 00:00:43,892
The top part of the orchid has rotted.

4
00:00:45,891 --> 00:00:54,890
I need to remove all the rotten spots.

5
00:00:57,889 --> 00:01:07,887
Throw away the old moss.

6
00:01:10,886 --> 00:01:16,885
Cut off damaged roots.

7
00:01:31,972 --> 00:01:41,970
The flowers have all fallen off but the branches are still fresh.

8
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:54,878
Next I took 3 spoons of cinnamon powder.

9
00:01:58,877 --> 00:02:08,875
Then soak in 2 liters of boiled water.

10
00:02:16,873 --> 00:02:26,871
Incubate until the water cools.

11
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:55,899
After the water cools, filter to remove sediment.

12
00:03:02,898 --> 00:03:10,896
Add 4 liters of water.

13
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:26,893
Water and soak the orchid pot in this solution for 30 minutes

14
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:46,889
Cinnamon juice has antibacterial and antiseptic properties that help kill fungi and harmful insects.

15
00:03:50,888 --> 00:04:00,886
and protect the orchid from further rot.

16
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:37,879
Dry the leaves.

17
00:04:40,878 --> 00:04:50,876
Then leave it for 1 week without watering.

18
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:58,875
A WEEK LATER

19
00:05:01,874 --> 00:05:11,872
Adding new moss helps retain moisture better.

20
00:05:33,868 --> 00:05:44,899
Take 1 spoon of rice flour.

21
00:05:50,898 --> 00:05:59,896
and 1/2 teaspoon yeast.

22
00:06:00,896 --> 00:06:10,894
Soak in 2 liters of warm water for 2 hours.

23
00:06:15,893 --> 00:06:25,891
Rice water combined with yeast will form amino acids that are very good for orchid growth.

24
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:36,889
AFTER 2 HOURS.

25
00:06:38,888 --> 00:06:48,886
Filter residue.

26
00:06:51,886 --> 00:07:01,884
Apply this fermented rice fertilizer to orchid roots.

27
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:11,882
This liquid fertilizer stimulates the growth of shoots and roots very quickly.

28
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:33,877
Pour into the jar about 2 liters of water.

29
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:48,874
Next I took about 20 grams of aloe vera leaves.

30
00:07:48,874 --> 00:07:59,872
Aloe vera gel moisturizes and stimulates plant growth very well

31
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:15,869
Then squeeze aloe vera gel into a basin of water.

32
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:39,898
Then place the orchid pot on top.

33
00:08:39,898 --> 00:08:48,896
Note that the water only reaches the bottom edge of the orchid pot.

34
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:57,709
Then change the aloe vera gel water once a week.

35
00:09:03,893 --> 00:09:06,892
TWO MONTHS LATER.

36
00:09:12,891 --> 00:09:22,889
Orchids develop more roots and branches.

37
00:09:46,884 --> 00:09:52,883
revive another seedling.

38
00:09:58,882 --> 00:10:08,880
These branches are still blooming very healthily.

39
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:18,878
Hope the video will help you a lot.

40
00:10:18,878 --> 00:10:26,876
