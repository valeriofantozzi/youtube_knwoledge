00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:06,601 --> 00:00:14,898
This orchid has yellow leaf disease.

3
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:28,895
The cause is due to insects sucking tree sap and then being infected with fungi and bacteria through insect bites.

4
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:38,893
This disease leaves the leaves still succulent but falls off very quickly.

5
00:00:40,892 --> 00:00:50,890
Only one healthy leaf remains. The rest are infected.

6
00:00:56,691 --> 00:01:03,888
I cut here to check for disease inside the stem.

7
00:01:15,767 --> 00:01:26,883
All infected leaves need to be removed.

8
00:01:37,115 --> 00:01:48,879
Black spots are where the disease resides so they need to be removed.

9
00:02:16,873 --> 00:02:26,871
then take 5 spoons of cement.

10
00:02:39,341 --> 00:02:50,900
Mix 5 liters of water.

11
00:03:01,006 --> 00:03:09,896
Then wait for the sediment to settle.

12
00:03:19,097 --> 00:03:22,894
10 Minutes later.

13
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:41,890
Take only the clear water at the top.

14
00:03:59,886 --> 00:04:09,884
Clean orchid branches with cement water.

15
00:05:03,656 --> 00:05:16,522
Soak the orchid pot in cement water for 10 minutes

16
00:05:21,951 --> 00:05:29,868
Soak the moss in cement water for 10 minutes.

17
00:05:52,073 --> 00:06:02,895
Soak 10 eggshells in 2 liters of boiled water.

18
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:14,893
Wait for the water to cool.

19
00:06:17,363 --> 00:06:27,890
In the meantime, I recycle plastic bottles into orchid nursery equipment.

20
00:07:14,202 --> 00:07:26,879
Take 3 more Vitamin B1 tablets and mix them into eggshell water.

21
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:45,875
Soak the orchid branches in this water for 20 minutes.

22
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,872
20 minutes later.

23
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:18,868
Sprinkle cement powder on the cut.

24
00:09:01,226 --> 00:09:09,892
Place the orchid branch in.

25
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:17,890
Pour some water into the plate.

26
00:09:20,987 --> 00:09:30,887
Place in a cool place, avoid direct sunlight.

27
00:09:32,345 --> 00:09:42,885
After 1 week, spray water every 5 days.

28
00:09:50,805 --> 00:09:58,882
Water from eggshells and B1.

29
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:05,880
Pour some water into the bowl.

30
00:10:19,191 --> 00:10:29,876
Leave in a cool place, after 1 week spray water every 5 days.

31
00:10:45,106 --> 00:10:48,872
1 MONTH LATER.

32
00:10:52,971 --> 00:11:02,869
Roots grow very strongly.

33
00:11:02,869 --> 00:11:10,868
Now plant it in a pot so it can grow outside

34
00:11:19,014 --> 00:11:23,898
Under the orchid tree, two more small orchids have grown.

35
00:11:23,898 --> 00:11:28,897
Hope the video will help you a lot.

36
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:36,896

To help you have many options when caring for orchids at home with organic fertilizer.

39
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:12,889
Aims to protect the environment but still help orchids grow strongly.

40
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:21,887
In this video, I continue to share new methods.

42
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:41,883
To make this compost I recycle chicken bones into fertilizer.

43
00:12:45,882 --> 00:12:55,880
First, wash the chicken bones several times with water

44
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:09,877
Chicken bones are rich in potassium and calcium.

45
00:13:12,877 --> 00:13:22,875
These are all very benign substances and have very good effects for the growth and development of orchids.

46
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:32,873
Using chicken bones as fertilizer will help you take care of orchids more effectively.

47
00:13:36,872 --> 00:13:46,870
Wash the chicken bones and dry them crispy at low temperature.

48
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:16,897
After the chicken bones are dry and crispy, they will be ground into powder.

49
00:15:21,885 --> 00:15:31,883
Take 1 tablespoon of chicken bone powder and put it in a jar.

50
00:15:35,882 --> 00:15:45,880
Then soak with 2 liters of water.

51
00:15:56,878 --> 00:16:06,876
Wait a day before using.

52
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:20,873
The remainder is stored for use in the next batch.

53
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:38,869
A DAY LATER.

54
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:45,868
Filter out residue.

55
00:17:08,897 --> 00:17:12,896
FIRST METHOD.

56
00:17:15,895 --> 00:17:25,893
Water this fertilizer solution on the orchid roots.

57
00:17:31,892 --> 00:17:41,890
Chicken bones contain many minerals and organic substances that help provide nutrition for orchids.

58
00:17:46,889 --> 00:17:56,887
It contains nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus which are important for orchid growth.

59
00:18:02,886 --> 00:18:12,884
Potassium helps flower development and resists drought very well.

60
00:18:16,883 --> 00:18:26,881
Phosphorus helps roots grow quickly. Nitrogen will help develop orchid stems and leaves.

61
00:18:40,878 --> 00:18:45,878
NEXT METHOD

62
00:18:56,875 --> 00:19:06,873
Spray this fertilizer on the entire orchid.

63
00:19:11,872 --> 00:19:21,870
Spray the top and bottom of the leaves thoroughly

64
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:35,868
Spray seedlings to help them grow faster.

65
00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:54,897
Spraying the roots will stimulate many branches.

66
00:20:10,894 --> 00:20:16,893
RESULT

67
00:20:19,892 --> 00:20:29,890
After 1-2 months of applying this fertilizer, many roots and branches grow.

68
00:20:41,888 --> 00:20:51,886
Potassium in chicken bones helps prevent flower buds from wilting.

69
00:21:05,883 --> 00:21:16,881
The flowers bloom more brightly than usual.

70
00:21:32,878 --> 00:21:42,876
The flowers stay on the branches for a long time before fading.

71
00:21:42,876 --> 00:21:48,875
Thank you for watching the video. Good luck
goodbye and see you again in the next videos.
