Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:38,893
If you have an orchid that has rot causing it to lose all its leaves.

3
00:00:38,893 --> 00:00:46,891
So don't rush to throw it away. I'll share how to revive it quickly and easily.

4
00:00:51,890 --> 00:01:01,888
This orchid has a bacterial disease that causes it to rot.

5
00:01:02,888 --> 00:01:10,886
First, cut off and clean the rotten areas.

6
00:01:28,538 --> 00:01:38,881
Then completely cut off the damaged roots.

7
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:30,871
And this is hydrogen peroxide.

8
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:40,869
Place pure hydrogen peroxide on the rotten area.

9
00:02:46,867 --> 00:03:00,001
Helps eliminate pathogens and prevent rot from spreading.

10
00:03:04,897 --> 00:03:14,895
and you pour it on the cut to help disinfect it.

11
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:32,892
Then leave it for 1 day without irrigation to let the wound heal completely.

12
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:46,889
Take 3 liters of water.

13
00:03:52,888 --> 00:04:02,886
Take 1 teaspoon of baking soda and mix it with water.

14
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:22,882
Baking soda helps eliminate pathogens and needs to balance pH levels.

15
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:43,878
Soak the entire orchid in this water for 10 minutes.

16
00:04:51,876 --> 00:05:01,874
will eliminate pathogens and need to balance the PH level in the orchid growing environment.

17
00:05:30,868 --> 00:05:36,867
Then take it out.

18
00:05:48,898 --> 00:05:54,897
Pour water into the plate.

19
00:05:55,897 --> 00:06:05,895
helps the substrate always have the right moisture for orchids to germinate.

20
00:06:09,894 --> 00:06:19,892
Place in a cool, well-lit place.

21
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:36,889
Spray moisturizer regularly when the substrate feels dry.

22
00:06:51,383 --> 00:07:00,884
Take 2 spoons of rice.

23
00:07:02,883 --> 00:07:12,881
Rice water contains many nutrients that are very good for the growth of orchids.

24
00:07:30,878 --> 00:07:40,876
Soak orchid roots in rice water for 20 minutes.

25
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:52,874
Helps stimulate the growth of sprouts and roots

26
00:07:55,873 --> 00:08:01,878
Do it once a week.

27
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:26,900
After soaking for 20 minutes, take it out.

28
00:08:46,896 --> 00:08:50,895
1 MONTH LATER.

29
00:08:56,894 --> 00:09:06,892
From the rotten orchid root, a small healthy orchid is revived.

30
00:09:36,886 --> 00:09:46,884
Continue watering the orchid with rice water once a week.

31
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:59,882
Soak for 20 minutes then take out.

32
00:10:28,876 --> 00:10:32,875
After the next 1 month.

33
00:10:39,874 --> 00:10:49,872
Baby orchids are getting healthier and stronger.

34
00:11:06,868 --> 00:11:16,900
Orchid roots also grow very healthily.

35
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:32,897
