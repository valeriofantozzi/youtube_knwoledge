00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,120
Welcome to my channel. Today I want to

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,440
continue sharing with you a simple but

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,519
effective care method that helps your

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,920
orchid maintain continuous blooming

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,799
cycles while still keeping its natural

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:19,199
health. Orchids will always respond to

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:21,039
the love and patience you give them.

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,039
This orchid of mine has just gone

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,199
through a blooming cycle, so it has

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,560
become quite weak and needs time to

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,560
recover. When all the flowers fall off,

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,120
the plant's energy has been focused on

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,440
nourishing the blooms. So, it doesn't

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,520
have much strength left. Therefore, we

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,320
need to care for and restore the plant

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,239
in a timely manner so it can regain its

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,640
vitality and prepare for the next

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,640
blooming cycle.

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,239
First, we need to cut off the damaged

20
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,640
roots. These root parts can no longer

21
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,399
absorb water or nutrients and can even

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,280
cause rot to spread to the healthy

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,520
roots. By removing them, you are helping

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,440
the plant lighten its load and creating

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,440
conditions for new, stronger roots to

26
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,440
grow.

38
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,840
Next, cut off the damaged or yellowing

39
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,240
leaves. These leaves can no longer

40
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,399
perform photosynthesis effectively and

41
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,640
may drain the plant's energy, even

42
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,640
becoming spots where diseases can easily

43
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,640
develop.

[Music]

45
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,920
Now, we will cut off the old and dry

46
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,080
flower stems. These stems no longer have

47
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,160
aesthetic or nutritional value for the

48
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,879
plant. And if left, they can reduce the

49
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,879
plant's overall vitality.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,519
After finishing the pruning, you should

51
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,760
let the plant rest for a few days to

52
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,360
allow the cuts to heal. This is an

53
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,480
important step to help the plant avoid

54
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,480
infection or rot.

55
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,040
After a few days of rest, we will start

56
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,360
making a natural fertilizer to restore

57
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,160
the plant's health. This time, the

58
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,280
ingredient I chose is wheat flour, a

59
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,360
nutrientrich source of energy that helps

60
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,200
the plant quickly recover its roots and

61
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,200
leaves while creating favorable

62
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,200
conditions for new flower shoots to grow

63
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,200
vigorously.

64
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,840
You only need one full teaspoon of wheat

65
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,540
flour, enough to provide the necessary

66
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,840
nutrients without overdoing it.

67
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,840
[Music]

68
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,959
The next ingredient is aloe vera, and

69
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,959
you only need a small leaf.

70
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,040
Aloe vera not only provides water, but

71
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,879
also contains many vitamins and

72
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,040
minerals, helping the plant recover

73
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:36,400
quickly with greener, shinier, and

74
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,120
smoother leaves.

75
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,360
Then add 500 ml of water to the wheat

76
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,040
flour and aloe vera leaf and grind

77
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,440
thoroughly so that all the nutrients are

78
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,440
completely dissolved.

81
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,080
Next, strain out the solids from the

82
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,080
mixture. This helps make the solution

83
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,080
smooth.

85
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,199
Next, dilute the solution with an

86
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,040
additional 500 ml of clean water. This

87
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,040
step helps thin the mixture just enough

88
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,880
for the plant to absorb easily without

89
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,880
being too thick while ensuring the

90
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,720
nutrients spread evenly to the roots,

91
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,680
leaves, and flower shoots, helping the

92
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,680
plant recover more healthily.

Step one, water this natural fertilizer

97
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,240
mixture directly onto the roots and the

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,240
growing medium.

99
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,919
As the solution soaks in, the roots will

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,240
quickly absorb the necessary nutrients,

101
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,320
helping the plant regain vitality, grow

102
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,320
vigorously, and prepare for new flower

103
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,320
shoots.

104
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,720
When applying this fertilizer, the

105
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,440
nutrients from the wheat flour and aloe

106
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,560
vera will penetrate deeply into the

107
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,639
growing medium and the roots.

108
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,800
The orchid roots are provided with full

109
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,039
energy and minerals, helping them grow

111
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:52,759
enhance their ability to absorb water

112
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,759
and nutrients for the plant.

113
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,320
The vitamins and minerals from aloe vera

114
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,880
combined with the energy from wheat

115
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:04,639

shiny, smooth, and full of vitality.

117
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,560
Healthy leaves are an important

118
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,560
foundation for good photosynthesis,

119
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,080
providing a solid energy source for

120
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,800
flower shoots and the overall

121
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,800
development of the plant.

122
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,319
Step two, pour the natural fertilizer

123
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,560
mixture into a spray bottle. This allows

124
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,039

131
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,880
the top and underside of the leaves. The

132
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,400
fine mist will evenly coat them,

133
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,120

and stems, the nutrients penetrate

141
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,479
straight into the leaf tissue, providing

142
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,560
essential vitamins and minerals. The

143
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,960
leaves become green, firm, and

144
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:23,080
healthier, enhancing photosynthesis and

145
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,080
energy storage for the plant.

leaves also helps the plant receive

149
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,880
signals to develop flower shoots. When

150
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,560
the leaves and stems are healthy, the

151
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,039
plant has enough stored energy to

152
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,479
produce new buds, preparing for a more

vibrant next blooming cycle.

154
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,800
Besides the leaves and stems, you should

155
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,280
also spray directly onto the plant's

156
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,280
roots. Uh, as the nutrients penetrate

157
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,759
the roots, they are quickly absorbed,

158
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,160
helping the roots grow strong, anchor

159
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,680

growing environment in the garden is

222
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,320
very suitable. When the aerial roots are

223
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,640

224
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,279
and nutrients from the air, helping the

225
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,120
