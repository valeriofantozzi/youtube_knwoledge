First, to make this fertilizer, I use oats.

6
00:01:19,385 --> 00:01:29,883
Soak 1 tablespoon of oats in warm water for 1 hour.

7
00:01:50,012 --> 00:02:00,877
After 1 hour, puree the oats.

8
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:25,872
Filter out residue.

9
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:48,867
Next, take a spoonful of yogurt and mix it with water from the oatmeal.

10
00:03:00,032 --> 00:03:08,896
Then add water to get 2 liters of liquid fertilizer.

11
00:03:09,381 --> 00:03:12,896
METHOD 1.

12
00:03:18,295 --> 00:03:28,892
Wipe the top and bottom of the leaves with this liquid fertilizer.

13
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:47,889
This method helps eliminate fungi and insects that harm orchids.

14
00:03:53,705 --> 00:04:03,886
Also adds nutrition through leaves to orchids.

15
00:04:09,522 --> 00:04:19,882
This method helps leaves photosynthesize and synthesize chlorophyll better.

16
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:38,879
Helps keep green leaves and healthy plants.

17
00:04:42,423 --> 00:04:46,877
METHOD 2.

18
00:04:56,652 --> 00:05:06,873
Spray this liquid fertilizer on the entire orchid plant 1-2 times a month.

19
00:05:12,872 --> 00:05:22,870
Helps supplement nutrients through leaves and roots for orchids.

20
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:39,900
Oats are a source of many nutrients such as vitamins, minerals 

21
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:47,898
and fiber that are very good for the growth of orchids.

22
00:06:12,176 --> 00:06:15,893
METHOD 3.

23
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:29,890
Apply this liquid fertilizer to orchid roots 1-2 times a month.

24
00:06:35,401 --> 00:06:45,887
Yogurt contains lactic acid which helps control soil pH,

25
00:06:45,887 --> 00:06:54,885
Create good growing conditions for orchids to grow.

26
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:15,881
Yogurt provides calcium, phosphorus and other minerals that are very good for orchid growth.

27
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:36,877
This method helps provide nutrients directly through the roots so the orchid grows fastest.

28
00:07:54,272 --> 00:07:58,872
RESULT.

29
00:08:02,628 --> 00:08:12,870
After 2 months of fertilization, the orchid has developed many new roots.

30
00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:29,900
This helps orchids absorb the most nutrients.

31
00:08:34,121 --> 00:08:46,896
When provided with enough nutrition, the flowers will bloom more brilliantly.

32
00:08:52,306 --> 00:09:02,893
The flowers stay on the branches for a long time before fading.

33
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:26,322
Many flowers grow on the same branch without falling off.

34
00:09:30,246 --> 00:09:40,885
