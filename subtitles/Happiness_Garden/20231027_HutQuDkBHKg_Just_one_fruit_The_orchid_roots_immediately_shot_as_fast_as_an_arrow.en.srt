If you grow many orchids, it is inevitable that the orchids will rot due to bacteria or fungi.

3
00:00:14,898 --> 00:00:20,896
My orchid has leaf rot and stem rot.

4
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:30,894
When we encounter an orchid like this, we need to cut off all rotten leaves, roots, and stems.

To restore this orchid, I use 2 okra pods.

12
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:41,868
Soak in 1/2 US gallon of water (about 2 liters).

13
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:53,899
Wait 30 minutes for the gel and nutrients from the okra to dissolve into the water.

14
00:02:56,255 --> 00:03:02,898
Next take 1 teaspoon of cinnamon powder.

15
00:03:03,675 --> 00:03:12,896
Soak in 1/2 US gallon of boiling water (about 2 liters) for 30 minutes.

16
00:03:26,898 --> 00:03:30,892
AFTER 30 MINUTES.

17
00:03:40,995 --> 00:03:50,888
Filter out residue.

18
00:04:09,884 --> 00:04:18,883
Wipe the orchid with cinnamon water. This helps eliminate fungal diseases and harmful insects.

19
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:42,878
Then incubate the roots with cinnamon water for about 20 minutes to help disinfect 

20
00:04:42,878 --> 00:04:48,877
and stimulate roots to grow and germinate.

21
00:05:13,994 --> 00:05:21,870
Soak the moss in cinnamon water for 20 minutes. Helps eliminate fungi and bacteria in moss.

22
00:05:53,053 --> 00:06:03,895
Soak orchid stems in okra gel for 20 minutes.

23
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:40,888
Water okra gel into old orchid roots.

24
00:06:40,888 --> 00:06:48,886
This helps stimulate better germination and rooting.

25
00:06:58,884 --> 00:07:08,882
Adding moss helps retain moisture better.

26
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:23,879
Spray moisturizer with water once a week

27
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:29,878
Place in a cool, well-lit place.

28
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:50,874
I reused a plastic container and cut a drainage hole in the bottom.

29
00:08:01,626 --> 00:08:11,870
Place the orchid branch in then spray it with water to keep it moist once a week.

30
00:08:23,868 --> 00:08:30,900
Place in a cool, well-lit place.

31
00:08:38,545 --> 00:08:42,897
6 weeks later.

32
00:08:51,950 --> 00:09:01,893
You can see that the orchid has taken root and is very healthy.

33
00:09:04,893 --> 00:09:17,890
With this simple method, you can easily restore an orchid without roots.

34
00:09:30,425 --> 00:09:40,885
Because the roots are strong, I planted them in pots to help the plants grow quickly.

35
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:56,882
The old root below has also revived new orchid sprouts.

36
00:10:04,881 --> 00:10:14,879
Hope the video will help you a lot.

37
00:10:16,878 --> 00:10:26,876
Wishing you success and happiness in life. Goodbye and see you again in the next videos.
