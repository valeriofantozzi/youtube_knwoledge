Hello everyone. Welcome to the happiness

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,279
garden channel. Today I will share a

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,800
great tip for taking care of orchids

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,559
after the flowers have faded.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,719
This method is especially effective in

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:18,200
helping wilted or weak orchids recover

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,200
and grow quickly.

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,000
This is an orchid that has been attacked

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,240
by insects, causing its leaves to become

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,760
torn and no longer intact as they were

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,679
originally.

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,000
These marks are evidence that the plant

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,680
once had to fight against pests in

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,600
nature.

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,160
And this orchid has also finished its

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,920
previous blooming cycle. The once

18
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,760
vibrant flowers have now faded, making

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,500
way for the plant's period of rest and

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:52,640
energy regeneration.

[Music]

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,800
At this time, we need to cut off the

23
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,960
withered flower spike to prevent the

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,440
plant from wasting energy on a part that

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,039
is no longer necessary.

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,630
This will allow the plant to focus on

27
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:09,810
developing new roots and leaves.

Leaves that are severely damaged or

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,240
starting to turn yellow should also be

31
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,320
gently removed.

32
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,799
Removing damaged leaves helps the orchid

33
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,119
become more ventilated, reduces the risk

34
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,260
of fungal diseases, and allows it to

35
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,320

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,200
of mold appearing around the roots.

45
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,799
This is a warning sign that the plant is

46
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,360
having problems and needs to be treated

47
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,360
promptly to prevent spreading and root

49
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,799
Therefore, when growing orchids at home,

50
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,799
we should remove the moss and replace it

51
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:09,479
with a more breathable medium to avoid

52
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,479
water retention that can cause root rot.

78
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,120
important to sterilize the pruning tools

79
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,000

remove part parts that no longer absorb

To treat the orchid before planting, I

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,880
use lemon. You can use either green or

101
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:01,199
yellow lemons as both contain natural

support the plant's recovery process.

111
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,880
Next, we need to prepare the necessary

112
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,880
tools to dilute the lemon juice.

113
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,360
First, pour 3 L of clean water into a

114
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,440
container. This will serve as the base

115
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,280
to dilute the lemon juice, creating a

118
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,120
Next, add 3 tsp of lemon juice into the

119
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,600
container. This amount is just enough to

120
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:44,520
create a mild disinfecting solution that

121
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,520
cleans the roots without causing damage.

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,919
ensure the lemon juice is fully

125

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,240
Step one, use a soft cloth soaked in

128
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:16,759
this solution. Then gently wipe both the

129
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,759
upper and lower surfaces of the leaves.

This method also helps eliminate scale

146
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,280
insects at an early stage. Scale insects

147
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,440
cling tightly to both the upper and

148

take out the dried moss and pine bark

This is the final preparation step

197
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:01,640

Prepare a new pot with drainage holes at

202
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,760
the bottom. This design prevents water

203
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,760
from accumulating and creates a well

204
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,760

209
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,760
the roots are nestled within the medium,

210
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,079
but the base of the plant is not buried

211
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,079
too deeply.

When adding the growing medium, gently

215
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,079
shake the pot so that the pine bark and

216
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,160
moss fill in the gaps around the roots.

217
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,320
helping the plant stay stable and

218
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,560
allowing the roots to have even contact

219
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,560

220
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,800

surface of the growing medium after

222
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,000

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,399
light moisture around the base of the

224
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,920

225
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,920
fresh and more visually appealing look.

235
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,480
early warning sign, so it needs to be

236
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,680
treated promptly to prevent the spots

237
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:45,120

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,639
to sterilize the pruning tools with 90%

241
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,480

cut off the darkened part of the leaf.

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,160
Timely removal will help prevent the

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,520

spot with gentle sunlight and good

277
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,319
airflow and avoid watering for 1 week.

278
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,240
This allows the cuts to dry completely

279
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,240
and helps prevent root rot or fungal

280
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,240

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,440
After about one to two weeks, once the

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,360
roots have stabilized, in addition to

283
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,320
watering, you can gently apply a natural

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,640

You can see that the orchid has grown a

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,600

However, you should not spray directly

530
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,679

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,600
planted densely, they are prone to black

541
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,360

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,799
also help repel some types of insects,

570
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,360
protecting the orchids from pests and

571
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:40,360
keeping the leaves, stems, and flowers

572
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,360
healthy.

573
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,840
Uh the compounds in lemon peel have

574
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,080
antibacterial and antifungal properties,

575
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,919
helping protect orchids from diseases,

576
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,880
keeping the leaves, stems, and roots

577
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,949
healthy.

[Music]

579
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,279
Thanks to these properties, using the

580
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,200
lemon and baking soda mixture not only

581
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,679
provides nutrients but also prevents

582
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,600
fungal diseases, helping the orchids

583
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:09,080
grow comprehensively from roots to

584
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,080
leaves and flowers.

585
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,000
With this care method, you will see the

586
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,640
orchids grow healthy, produce many

587
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,039
roots, have glossy green leaves, and

588
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:30,039
bloom evenly, lasting throughout the

589
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,039
year.

[Music]

591
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,360
Do not underestimate natural

592
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,840
fertilizers. They are as effective as

593
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,559
synthetic mineral fertilizers, but safer

594
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,320
for the plants and the environment.

595
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,760
Initially, the plants may grow more

596
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,240
slowly compared to inorganic

597
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,919
fertilizers, but once the nutrients are

598
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:55,080
fully absorbed, they will grow

599
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:55,080
sustainably healthy and longlasting.

600
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,960
Do this one to two times a month to help

601
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:05,000
protect the orchids, keeping them

602
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,000
healthy and growing sustainably.

603
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,080
On my channel, I share many great ways

604
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,480
for you to make natural fertilizers

605
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,799
yourself, helping you care for orchids

606
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,960
at home effectively and safely. Give

607
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:19,600
them a try and see the remarkable change

608
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,919
in your plants.

[Music]

610
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,640
After soaking for about 20 minutes,

611
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,880
gently lift the orchid pot out and place

612
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,200
it in a spot with diffused light so the

613
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:35,240
plant can continue photosynthesizing and

614
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,240
recover in the best way.

615
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,240
Uh remember that no matter how well you

616
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,080
fertilize, if the orchids do not receive

617
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,720
enough light, they will still be

618
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:47,039
stunted, have yellowing leaves, and

619
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,320
struggle to bloom. Light is the key

620
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:52,399
factor that helps the plants

621
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:54,240
photosynthesize and grow healthy.

622
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:56,559
Sunlight helps orchids carry out

623
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,399
photosynthesis, thereby converting the

624
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:01,279
nutrients in the fertilizer into the

625
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:03,760
energy needed for the plant's growth.

626
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:05,679
Thanks to light, the plant can absorb

627
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,610
and use the nutrients we provide to the

628
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,960
fullest.

00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,520
ingredients, caring for orchids becomes

632
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,599
simple, safe, and still incredibly

633
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,919
effective. Be patient in applying this

634
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,839
