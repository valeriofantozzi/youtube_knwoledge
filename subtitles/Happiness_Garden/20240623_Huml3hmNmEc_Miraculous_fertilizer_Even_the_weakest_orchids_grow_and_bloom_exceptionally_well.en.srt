Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,598
Today's video I share how to easily make your own fertilizer

3
00:00:14,942 --> 00:00:22,929
But its effects are miraculous.

4
00:00:38,468 --> 00:00:43,073
Let's start.

5
00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:54,534
To make this magical fertilizer you need flour.

6
00:00:56,794 --> 00:01:05,534
I took 3 tablespoons of flour.

7
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:17,152
And take another spoonful of yeast (the type of yeast used to make bread).

8
00:01:43,735 --> 00:01:52,778
Add a little warm water.

9
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:25,616
Then incubate for 2 hours for the beneficial microorganisms in the yeast to take effect.

10
00:02:35,265 --> 00:02:41,235
AFTER 2 HOURS.

11
00:02:44,058 --> 00:02:54,066
Currently, the beneficial microorganisms in yeast have multiplied many times over.

12
00:03:08,047 --> 00:03:26,560
Mix with 5 liters of water.

13
00:03:48,922 --> 00:03:54,921
FIRST METHOD

14
00:03:55,926 --> 00:04:05,918
Water the orchid roots with this microbial fertilizer solution.

15
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:21,267
Beneficial microorganisms will grow in the orchid pot.

16
00:04:29,665 --> 00:04:39,645
Helps protect orchid roots from rot caused by fungi and bacteria.

17
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:56,242
This type of fertilizer also balances the PH level in orchid pots.

18
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:10,172
Helps stimulate orchid roots to grow and not be damaged by acid.

19
00:05:23,043 --> 00:05:33,035
This type of fertilizer also provides many necessary nutrients for orchids such as:

20
00:05:38,313 --> 00:05:48,298
Potassium, phosphorus, nitrogen, magnesium, calcium, iron, zinc and vitamins...

21
00:06:00,738 --> 00:06:10,706
It would be better to soak the orchid pot for 30 minutes.

22
00:06:15,212 --> 00:06:26,191
This type of fertilizer is especially good for weak, stunted orchids with underdeveloped root systems.

23
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:39,788
because it does not shock weak orchids like chemical fertilizers.

24
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:52,885
SECOND METHOD

25
00:06:56,368 --> 00:07:06,349
Wipe the leaves clean with this microbial fertilizer solution.

26
00:07:18,065 --> 00:07:28,045
Helps eliminate insects and leaf-damaging fungi.

27
00:07:38,705 --> 00:07:42,676
THRD METHOD

28
00:07:55,447 --> 00:08:05,438
Spray this fertilizer solution over the entire orchid.

29
00:08:18,842 --> 00:08:28,866
Especially with weak orchids, it will help recover quickly.

30
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:36,965
RESURT

31
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:49,362
If you do this every 2 weeks, after only 1-2 months the orchid will have many new roots.

32
00:08:56,917 --> 00:09:06,892
This helps the orchid absorb maximum nutrients through its roots.

33
00:09:11,713 --> 00:09:21,689
Flowers bloom brightly and colorfully.

34
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:36,253
Many flowers bloom on the same branch.

35
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:56,049
Thank you for watching the video. Good luck

36
00:09:56,049 --> 00:09:59,034
Goodbye and see you again in the next video.
