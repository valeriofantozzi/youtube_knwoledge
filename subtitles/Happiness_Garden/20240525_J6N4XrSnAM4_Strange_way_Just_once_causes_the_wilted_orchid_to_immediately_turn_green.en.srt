Welcome to Hapiness Garden channel

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,659
I am a nutritionist for orchids

3
00:00:06,659 --> 00:00:13,061
In this video I show you how to make an organic fertilizer

4
00:00:13,061 --> 00:00:19,754
to help restore weak, yellowed, and wilted orchids

5
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:29,618
To make fertilizer you use 1 aloe leaf

6
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:39,559
Aloe vera gel helps to stimulate roots very well

7
00:00:39,593 --> 00:00:47,491
At the same time, it helps to retain moisture and restore wilted leaves very quickly

8
00:00:48,475 --> 00:00:58,456
next you use 1-2 more eggshells

9
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:13,854
Remember to wash it to remove the fungus

10
00:01:15,735 --> 00:01:22,717
Eggshells contain 70% calcium

11
00:01:22,717 --> 00:01:29,316
Will help the orchid grow stronger,

12
00:01:29,316 --> 00:01:35,259
improve resistance to fungi and insects

13
00:01:41,805 --> 00:01:53,781
Then puree aloe vera leaves and egg shells with 300ml of filtered water

14
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:06,642
Filter out the residue

15
00:02:11,053 --> 00:02:27,719
Add water to get 3 liters of aloe vera solution

16
00:03:13,216 --> 00:03:16,195
first way

17
00:03:28,735 --> 00:03:39,724
Wipe the top and bottom of orchids with wilted leaves every 2 days

18
00:03:39,724 --> 00:03:47,535
Aloe vera gel contains many vitamins and minerals necessary for plants

19
00:03:47,535 --> 00:03:56,120
and aloe vera gel also moisturizes well, so it helps to recover wilted leaves very quickly

20
00:03:57,544 --> 00:04:08,518
Wipe the top and bottom of orchids with wilted leaves every 2 days

21
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:25,515
If you do this regularly, the orchid's leaves will always be green and not be attacked by fungi and insects

22
00:04:33,634 --> 00:04:36,612
Second way:

23
00:04:38,383 --> 00:04:48,377
Watering aloe vera for wilted orchids once a week

24
00:04:52,129 --> 00:05:03,107
Will provide the orchid with essential vitamins and minerals through the roots

25
00:05:03,107 --> 00:05:12,739
At the same time, it is also a fertilizer that helps to revive roots very quickly

26
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:23,303
For normal growing orchids, water aloe vera every 2 weeks

27
00:05:28,777 --> 00:05:31,768
3rd way

28
00:05:34,988 --> 00:05:45,999
Spray aloe vera juice on wilted orchid once every 3 days

29
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:56,023
like we fertilize the orchid leaves

30
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:10,960
For normal orchid growth, just mist with aloe vera juice every 2 weeks

31
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:20,758
This helps the orchid grow and keep the flower on the branch for a long time

32
00:06:24,244 --> 00:06:27,224
Let's see the results together

33
00:06:33,565 --> 00:06:43,554
After 2 weeks of use, my wilted orchid has grown new roots

34
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:04,197
This orchid has also grown many new roots

35
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:16,447
Growing roots help absorb more nutrients and water

36
00:07:18,447 --> 00:07:28,912
help wilted orchid quickly recover wilted leaves

37
00:07:30,386 --> 00:07:40,376
As for orchids that are growing normally, it will promote faster growth

38
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:52,358
Orchids have developed roots, flowers bloom longer and keep on branches longer

39
00:07:52,358 --> 00:07:57,573
If you haven't received any value, don't leave the video.
