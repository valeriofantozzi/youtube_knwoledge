00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello friends

2
00:00:08,745 --> 00:00:16,731
I am an expert in organic fertilizers and orchid care techniques

3
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:27,095
In this video, I show you how to rejuvenate an old orchid

4
00:00:28,773 --> 00:00:38,759
and the secret to revive the orchid to take root and produce young leaves

5
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:52,457
Cut off damaged leaves

6
00:01:12,108 --> 00:01:18,085
Cut off damaged roots

7
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:39,714
Rinse with water

8
00:01:49,737 --> 00:01:56,711
Use 1 clove of garlic

9
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:09,975
Use 1 sprig of fresh ginger

10
00:02:12,992 --> 00:02:18,973
300ml filtered water

11
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:30,071
Garlic and ginger have a very good effect on stimulating germination and roots

12
00:02:31,997 --> 00:02:41,968
Puree garlic and ginger with 300 ml of water

13
00:02:49,006 --> 00:02:55,999
Filter out the residue

14
00:03:02,836 --> 00:03:12,829
Soak orchid branches in garlic and ginger juice for 20 minutes

15
00:03:18,222 --> 00:03:28,193
Remove the branches after soaking for 20 minutes

16
00:03:39,257 --> 00:03:47,255
Wipe and wait for the cut to dry
0:03:56.386,1193:02:47.295
Dip the cut in the molten candle solution

17
00:04:21,504 --> 00:04:33,480
Recycle plastic boxes into mini greenhouses to revive weak orchids to grow faster

18
00:04:57,971 --> 00:05:07,447
Put orchid branches in miniature greenhouse

19
00:05:08,631 --> 00:05:18,930
Pour water into the miniature greenhouse but don't let the water reach the orchid's branches

20
00:05:21,214 --> 00:05:33,201
Place the orchid in a cool place, the temperature is 20-30 degrees Celsius, there is light but avoid direct sunlight

21
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:49,031
Now I will rejuvenate this old orchid

22
00:06:31,438 --> 00:06:39,421
Water once every 2 weeks and keep in a cool place as above

23
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:48,353
5 Weeks Later

24
00:06:53,072 --> 00:07:05,050
The old orchid root has been rejuvenated

25
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:19,913
The old root has grown 2 sprouts and produced many new healthy roots

26
00:07:29,603 --> 00:07:43,575
The orchid branch has grown many roots and is very healthy

27
00:07:45,803 --> 00:07:55,773
and grow 1 more young leaf

28
00:08:04,947 --> 00:08:16,935
Now I plant in pots to grow orchids in the outside environment

29
00:08:20,894 --> 00:08:28,900
After planting, you take care of them like any other normal plant

32
00:09:02,436 --> 00:09:12,425
Now I will show you how to make orchids not root or orchids with root rot quickly.

33
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:22,889
This is a wilted orchid.

34
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:42,885
Only the top part of the orchid is still fresh.

35
00:09:43,969 --> 00:09:51,883
I dipped the cut into this molten candle solution.

36
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:58,882
This method helps cuts heal quickly and does not rot.

37
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:10,880
I use 1 aloe vera leaf.

38
00:10:33,542 --> 00:10:43,873
Put into blender with 300ml of water.

39
00:11:04,869 --> 00:11:12,867
Filter out the residue.

40
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:38,896
Soak orchid branches in aloe vera water for 30 minutes.

41
00:11:51,156 --> 00:11:56,892
30 MINUTES LATER.

42
00:11:56,892 --> 00:12:06,890
Take out the orchid branches and dry them.

43
00:12:40,103 --> 00:12:50,881
Plug the orchid branches into the foam and then put them in a plastic box.

44
00:12:51,548 --> 00:13:01,879
Water it just enough to keep it moist, then take the orchid pot to a cool place with light light but not direct sunlight.

45
00:13:16,785 --> 00:13:20,875
45 DAYS LATER.

46
00:13:39,872 --> 00:13:49,870
You can see that your orchid has grown very healthy roots.

47
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:12,898
and even grow very strong new leaves.

48
00:14:28,474 --> 00:14:38,893
Now I need to plant the orchid in a pot so it can grow in a normal outside environment.

49
00:15:21,885 --> 00:15:31,883
Add some moss on top to keep the roots moist.

50
00:15:42,385 --> 00:15:50,879
Water to keep moist.

51
00:16:03,111 --> 00:16:13,874
So with this simple way, anyone can revive a withered orchid to grow again.

52
00:16:30,871 --> 00:16:40,869
Hopefully this little trick will help you take better care of orchids at home.

53
00:16:52,476 --> 00:17:00,899
This is Dendrobium orchid, an orchid with a very beautiful scent and color.

54
00:17:03,385 --> 00:17:13,896
In this video I will show you how to revive denrobium orchids.

55
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:26,893
1. Cut off all old and damaged roots.

56
00:17:29,428 --> 00:17:38,891
In this video, I have subtitles in all countries.

57
00:17:39,891 --> 00:17:50,889
So you can choose subtitles (CC) in the correct language to understand the video content.

58
00:18:31,046 --> 00:18:41,879
2. Rinse with water.

59
00:18:58,551 --> 00:19:08,873
3. Add 5 drops of rooting and budding stimulant solution mixed with 50ml of filtered water.

60
00:19:26,773 --> 00:19:36,868
4. Soak this dry orchid branch in this water for 30 minutes.

61
00:19:47,362 --> 00:19:57,897
5. Recycle plastic boxes into miniature greenhouses to propagate orchids faster.

62
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:08,895
Use floral foam.

63
00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:33,878
6. Put the orchid in a miniature greenhouse.

64
00:21:34,537 --> 00:21:44,876
7. Pour in filtered water just enough to moisten it.

65
00:21:49,966 --> 00:21:59,873
I only add enough water and I will add more when the water runs out.

66
00:22:33,488 --> 00:22:36,899
2 Months Later.

67
00:22:40,368 --> 00:22:50,896
So after 2 months the withered denrobium orchid was revived.

68
00:23:04,652 --> 00:23:13,891
Young orchids grow roots very well.

69
00:23:33,864 --> 00:23:43,885
This orchid is smaller but the roots are also very strong.

70
00:24:00,957 --> 00:24:10,880
Now I will plant in pots to grow orchids in an environment outside the greenhouse.

71
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:18,900
denrobium grows very quickly so I will put it in a larger pot.

72
00:25:39,068 --> 00:25:50,894
After planting, you water and care for it like other normal orchids.

73
00:26:03,434 --> 00:26:05,890
1 YEAR LATER.

74
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:11,889
Thus, a withered orchid revives after a year of beautiful blooming.

75
00:26:11,889 --> 00:26:16,888
That's all I want to share with you in this video.

76
00:26:17,888 --> 00:26:23,787

78
00:26:30,758 --> 00:26:32,885
Welcome to Hapiness Garden channel

79
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:36,384
I am a nutritionist for orchids

80
00:26:36,384 --> 00:26:43,383
In this video I show you how to make an organic fertilizer

81
00:26:43,383 --> 00:26:49,382
to help restore weak, yellowed, and wilted orchids

82
00:26:49,382 --> 00:26:59,380
To make fertilizer you use 1 aloe leaf

83
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:09,378
Aloe vera gel helps to stimulate roots very well

84
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:17,376
At the same time, it helps to retain moisture and restore wilted leaves very quickly

85
00:27:18,376 --> 00:27:28,374
next you use 1-2 more eggshells

86
00:27:28,374 --> 00:27:30,374
Remember to wash it to remove the fungus

87
00:27:33,373 --> 00:27:43,371
Remember to wash it to remove the fungus

88
00:27:45,371 --> 00:27:52,369
Eggshells contain 70% calcium

89
00:27:52,369 --> 00:27:59,368
Will help the orchid grow stronger,

90
00:27:59,368 --> 00:28:05,400
improve resistance to fungi and insects

91
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:23,396
Then puree aloe vera leaves and egg shells with 300ml of filtered water

92
00:28:27,396 --> 00:28:36,394
Filter out the residue

93
00:28:41,393 --> 00:28:57,390
Add water to get 3 liters of aloe vera solution

94
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:46,380
first way

95
00:29:58,378 --> 00:30:09,375
Wipe the top and bottom of orchids with wilted leaves every 2 days

96
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:17,607
Aloe vera gel contains many vitamins and minerals necessary for plants

97
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:26,605
and aloe vera gel also moisturizes well, so it helps to recover wilted leaves very quickly

98
00:30:27,605 --> 00:30:36,603
Wipe the top and bottom of orchids with wilted leaves every 2 days

99
00:30:41,602 --> 00:30:55,633
If you do this regularly, the orchid's leaves will always be green and not be attacked by fungi and insects

100
00:31:03,631 --> 00:31:06,631
Second way:

101
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:18,628
Watering aloe vera for wilted orchids once a week

102
00:31:22,628 --> 00:31:33,625
Will provide the orchid with essential vitamins and minerals through the roots

103
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:42,624
At the same time, it is also a fertilizer that helps to revive roots very quickly

104
00:31:43,623 --> 00:31:53,621
For normal growing orchids, water aloe vera every 2 weeks

105
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:01,620
3rd way

106
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:15,617
Spray aloe vera juice on wilted orchid once every 3 days

107
00:32:15,617 --> 00:32:25,615
like we fertilize the orchid leaves

108
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:40,612
For normal orchid growth, just mist with aloe vera juice every 2 weeks

109
00:32:40,612 --> 00:32:50,610
This helps the orchid grow and keep the flower on the branch for a long time

110
00:32:54,609 --> 00:32:57,609
Let's see the results together

111
00:33:03,608 --> 00:33:13,606
After 2 weeks of use, my wilted orchid has grown new roots

112
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:34,601
This orchid has also grown many new roots

113
00:33:35,601 --> 00:33:46,632
Growing roots help absorb more nutrients and water

114
00:33:48,632 --> 00:33:58,630
help wilted orchid quickly recover wilted leaves

115
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:10,628
As for orchids that are growing normally, it will promote faster growth

116
00:34:10,628 --> 00:34:22,625
Orchids have developed roots, flowers bloom longer and keep on branches longer

117
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:27,624
If you haven't received any value, don't leave the video.

118
00:34:27,624 --> 00:34:30,024
Part 2/2 I share easy tips for propagating orchids that anyone can do themselves
