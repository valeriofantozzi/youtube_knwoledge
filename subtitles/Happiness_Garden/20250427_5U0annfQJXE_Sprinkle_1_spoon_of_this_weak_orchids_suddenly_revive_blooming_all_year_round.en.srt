00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,680
I'm very happy to welcome you to my

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:09,680
little garden where every flower is

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,680
cared for with all my love and

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,559
patience. Today I will continue to guide

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,080
you on how to revive weak orchids, those

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,359
that have become exhausted after

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,800
blooming so so they can regain their

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:24,640
vitality, grow healthily, and get ready

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,640
for a vibrant next blooming

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,080
season. You can easily notice that this

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,679
orchid is wilting. If not revived in

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,840
time, it is very likely that the plant

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,840
will

14
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:41,379
[Music]

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,960
die. When you notice that the orchid is

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,800
wilting, the first and most important

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,360
step is to immediately check the growing

18
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,120
medium and the root system, as these are

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,120
the key factors that will help the plant

20
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,239
recover. After checking, I found that

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,080
the orchid has a lot of rotting roots.

22
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,920
So, we need to cut off all the damaged

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,159
roots so that the plant can recover and

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,159
grow

25
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,040
back. Removing the damaged roots helps

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,880
stop the spread of fungi and bacteria

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,759
while also creating favorable conditions

28
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,360
for new healthy roots to grow. This in

29
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,240
turn helps the orchid recover quickly

30
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,240
and continue to

31
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,400
thrive. Next, we need to remove the

32
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,560
yellowing and wilting leaves as this

33
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,320
will help the plant focus its energy on

34
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,320
recovering and developing healthier

35
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,320
parts.

[Music]

37
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,920
Next, we need to cut off the old flower

38
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,039
stems as this will help the plant focus

39
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,120
its nutrients on developing new parts,

40
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:15,480
supporting the recovery process, and

41
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,480
preparing for the next blooming season.

[Music]

43
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,200
After cutting off the damaged roots, we

44
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,400
wash the plant under running water to

45
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,879
remove dirt, bacteria, and mold while

46
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,480
also cleaning the growing medium. This

47
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,800
creates a better environment for the

48
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,800
plant to absorb water and nutrients more

49
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,800
easily.

50
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,760
Now we will prepare fertilizer to help

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,440
restore the health of the orchid,

52
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,800
providing the necessary nutrients for

53
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,800
the plant to grow strong again.

54
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,159
To make natural fertilizer, I use one

55
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,519
teaspoon of sugar, which provides a

56
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,519
natural energy source for the

57
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,159
plant. Then dilute it with one liter of

58
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,599
water to create a fertilizer solution

59
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,599
that is easy for the plant to absorb.

[Music]

61
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,400
After preparing the solution, pour it

62
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,879
over and soak the orchid leaves for

63
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,040
about 20 minutes. This helps provide

64
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,040
nutrients directly to the plant, aiding

65
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,560
in the recovery of wilted leaves and

66
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,560
stimulating the growth of new leaves.

67
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,120
This process will help revive the wilted

68
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,439
leaves, making them fresher and

69
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,840
healthier by replenishing energy and

70
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,840
essential nutrients.

71
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,400
Next, take one liter of water to prepare

72
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,840
the second natural fertilizer, which

73
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,000
will provide additional nutrients for

74
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,000
the orchid.

75
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,840
Then add one teaspoon of dry yeast,

76
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,400
which helps stimulate the decomposition

77
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,080
process and improve the soil quality,

78
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,479
creating a favorable environment for the

79
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,479
plant's

80
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,280
growth. Next, add 1 teaspoon of flour.

81
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,160
The combination of flour and yeast in

82
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,000
the water will create a nutrient-rich

83
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,400

for about 20 minutes, be sure to remove

95
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,240
them and avoid leaving them in the

I spread a layer of moss on top of the

192
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,000
pot to help retain moisture for the

193
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,920
plant, protect the roots from direct

194
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,639
sunlight, and create stable conditions

195
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,639
for the orchid's growth.

[Music]

197
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,680
I spread a layer of moss on top of the

198
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,360
pot to help retain moisture for the

199
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,360
plant, protect the roots from direct

200
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,079
sunlight, and create stable conditions

201
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,079
for the orchid's growth.

202
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,530
[Music]

203
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,440
From now on, water the orchid with this

204
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,040
fertilizer mixture once a week to

205
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,560
provide continu continuous nutrients

206
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,720
helping the plant recover quickly and

207
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,720
grow

208
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:41,120
healthily. On regular days when the

209
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,040
growing medium is dry, simply water the

210
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:47,160
orchid to maintain moisture, helping the

211
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,160
plant stay hydrated without wilting.

212
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,279
Then place the orchid pot in a spot with

213
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,959
gentle sunlight, ensuring the plant

214
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,480
receives enough light without the risk

215
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,279
of leaf burn, creating the best

216
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,279
conditions for its

217
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:10,560
growth. Now, let's take a look at the

218
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,260
results after 3 weeks of caring for the

219
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,480
orchid with natural fertilizer.

220
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,480
[Music]

221
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,000
You can see that many new roots have

222
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:26,279
sprouted, indicating that the orchid is

223
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,279
recovering well and growing strongly.

224
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,969
[Music]

225
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,720
Although the leaves are still wilted, as

226
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,560
new roots develop, the plant will

227
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,320
gradually recover and start growing new

228
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,320
leaves, making it stronger and

229
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,480
healthier.

230
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,519
Continue watering the orchid with this

231
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,519
fertilizer mixture once a week to

232
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,279
maintain strong growth and help the

233
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,279
plant produce new roots and grow

234
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,279
healthily.

235
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,360
And here is the result after 2 months of

236
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,720
recovery with natural

237
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,160
fertilizer. As you can see, although the

238
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,399
leaves are still wilted, they have

239
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,240
become much sturdier compared to before,

240
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,240
showing that the plant is gradually

241
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,240
recovering.

242
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,480
The orchid has even grown a new flower

243
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,600
spike, indicating that the recovery

244
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,280
process is progressing very well. This

245
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,199
shows that the plant is gradually coming

246
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,799
back to life. Not only recovering its

247
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,880
leaves, but also starting to show signs

248
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:18,760
of strong growth, such as the appearance

249
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,760
of a new flower spike.

250
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:22,969
[Music]

251
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,559
I continue to water the orchid with this

252
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,400
natural fertilizer mixture once a week,

253
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,919
providing regular nutrients to help the

254
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,400
plant grow healthily and produce

255
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,400
beautiful flowers.

256
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,280
Once the orchid has developed enough

257
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,760
roots and is securely anchored in the

258
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,760
medium and pot, we can remove the tying

259
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,520
string to prevent it from constricting

260
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,840
the plant, allowing it to continue

261
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,840
growing naturally.

of recovery, the orchid has fully

267
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,120
revived.

268
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,039
As you can see, after 3 months of

269
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,039
recovery, the orchid has fully

270
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,600
revived. The leaves are now vibrant and

271
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,679
full of life, showing that the care

272
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,360
method has been incredibly effective,

273
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,000
helping the plant grow strong and

274
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,000
healthy once

275
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:07,200
again. What do you think about the way I

276
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,559
revived my weak orchid? Feel free to

flowers about to bloom, the orchid now

282
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:24,000
shows a remarkable recovery and promises

283
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,000
