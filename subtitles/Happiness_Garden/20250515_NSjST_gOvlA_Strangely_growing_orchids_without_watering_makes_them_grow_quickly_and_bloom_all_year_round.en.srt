grow it to grow

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,120
fast. When I just bought orchids, we

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,120
remove all this

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,400
moss. Uh because these orchid pots are

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,840
grown in an industrial environment

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,800
controlled by temperature, humidity, and

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,800
uh ideal for orchids.

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,399
But when brought back, the environment

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,120
has changed, making these roots

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,399
susceptible to rot. Therefore, you

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,399
should cut off damaged

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,640
roots. Please comment to me which

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,320
country you are watching the video from.

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,920
It's great that we can chat together

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,710
from all over the

19
00:00:50,920 --> 00:01:03,840

[Music]

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,680
Taking advantage of used plastic

22
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,830
bottles, I recycled them into hydroponic

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:20,000
orchid pots.

[Music]

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,840
This method of planting will not require

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
watering, but will still help orchids

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,930
grow very healthily and produce more

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,089

30
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,240
flowers. Recycling plastic bottles to

31
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,280
make orchid pots is not only a great way

32
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,000
to repurpose used materials, uh, but

33
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,680
also helps protect the environment. This

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,310
way we reduce plastic waste while

35
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:58,040
creating unique and sustainable orchid

42
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,440
I need to wash the plastic bottle to

43
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,879
make sure it's clean from fungi and

44
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,879

Using the drill bit, we'll cut out the

54
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,480
This part will be used as an orchid

[Music]

56
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:03,199

[Music]

58
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,360
storage. Using a glass jar on the bottom

59
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,360
will help the roots not absorb too much

60
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,360
water.

62
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,880
Put the orchid

[Music]

64
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,400
in. Put terracotta seeds around the pot.

65
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,960
grown in a semi-hydroponic environment,

66
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,720
often in contact with water. So, we use

67
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,720
breathable terracotta beads as the

68
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,019
[Music]

69
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:08,000
best. If it's breathable, it's very

70
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,880
rarely rotten. And after planting, the

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,880
roots will grow very fast.

72
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:20,769
[Music]

73
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,840
So, I've finished

00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:36,880
[Music]

75
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,880
planting. You water the potted

76
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:43,780
plants. We only water once. next time

77
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,919
you don't need to water

78
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:49,039

00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:50,960

80
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,140

81
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,279

[Music]

83
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,639
of. With this planting method, you will

84
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,039
let the water level cover part of the

85
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,039
bottom of the pot.

00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:10,240
[Music]

87
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,880
The water will absorb itself, helping to

88
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,690
maintain the moisture in the growing

89
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:19,880
medium. We will not need to water

90
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:22,080
[Music]

91
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,319
anymore. When the water in the container

92
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,000
is empty, remember to add more water to

93
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,000
keep the growing medium in a moist

94
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:33,520

95
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,199
state. And this is the orchid. I planted

96
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,759
it using this method. You can see it

97
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,759
grows very

98
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:44,270
quickly. The flowers are durable and

99
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:54,919
have many flower stems on the same

100
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:57,520

101
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:59,759
branch. And I also grow this orchid

102
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,000
using the semihydroponic method using

103
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,870
pine bark. When it flowers, it has

104
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,360
vibrant colors and stays fresh

105
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:10,360

106
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,759

107
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:20,000

108
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,000
wellmaintained. The roots will grow very

109
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:24,639
quickly. A strong root system will help

110
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:30,199
the plant perform metabolism and absorb

111
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,199
organic fertilizer and water very well.

112
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:36,039
Uh, with this simple planting method, we

113
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,880
will get orchids that grow

00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:40,639
faster. I hope this video provides

137
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:56,120

ability to increase the pH level in

167
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,639
orchid pots. This is helpful in reducing

168
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,639
acidity if you use too much chemical

protect orchids from insects and
