Welcome to my channel

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,071
There are different ways to care for orchids at home,

3
00:00:09,071 --> 00:00:13,454
Today I share a new method for you to have more choices.

4
00:00:15,232 --> 00:00:21,291
This is an aloe plant

5
00:00:26,537 --> 00:00:35,899
Use 1 aloe leaf

6
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:04,522
Add 1 liter of water at room temperature

7
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:13,818
Leave in the dark for 1 day

8
00:02:24,485 --> 00:02:26,485
AFTER 1 DAY

9
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:44,341
You will get red aloe vera juice like this

10
00:03:13,432 --> 00:03:17,414
Use cotton balls

11
00:03:22,756 --> 00:03:30,120
Clean the top and bottom of the orchid leaves

12
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:39,201
Water soaked in aloe vera leaves has many uses

13
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:53,101
Widely used in cosmetic, hair and skin industries

14
00:03:53,101 --> 00:04:05,719
For plants, aloe vera helps kill fungi and bacteria that cause rot very quickly

15
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:12,534
Because in aloe vera contains a high content of natural antibiotics

16
00:04:12,534 --> 00:04:21,652
it's many times better than garlic and antibiotics

17
00:04:24,803 --> 00:04:49,214
Pay attention to thoroughly wipe the underside of the leaves because this place contains many fungi, bacteria and insects

18
00:04:49,214 --> 00:05:05,579
Clean the surface of leaves with aloe vera juice every 2 weeks

19
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:13,805
Helps open stomata on orchid leaves

20
00:05:13,805 --> 00:05:20,718
and kill fungi, bacteria, insects

21
00:05:24,686 --> 00:05:46,856
Watering aloe vera on the entire root and growing medium

22
00:05:46,856 --> 00:06:03,980
Water it like this once a month

23
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:14,893
Aloe vera juice is also a rich source of nutrients for orchids

24
00:06:14,893 --> 00:06:26,981
because aloe vera contains 75 kinds of nutrients including: 20 kinds of minerals, 12 kinds of vitamins, enzymes and antioxidants,

25
00:06:26,981 --> 00:06:49,398
This will stimulate the orchid to sprout and take root very quickly

26
00:06:49,398 --> 00:06:56,267
If you do it regularly, orchid leaves will always be green

27
00:06:56,267 --> 00:07:01,507
If the orchid is healthy, the flowers will also bloom

28
00:07:01,507 --> 00:07:07,833
flowers also last a long time

29
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:19,665
Each year will bloom from 2 to 3 times depending on the orchid variety and the growth of the orchid

30
00:07:19,665 --> 00:07:27,053
The flower color is also more beautiful

31
00:07:29,743 --> 00:07:38,466
flower buds won't fall

32
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:48,120

Welcome to part 2 of the video

35
00:08:03,871 --> 00:08:07,870
when the orchid has faded,

36
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,870
We can completely propagate from branches,

37
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,869
Today I will show you how to breed very simply.

38
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:47,896
Peel off the outer membrane

39
00:08:47,896 --> 00:08:59,893
Thus, small orchid sprouts will easily grow

40
00:09:05,892 --> 00:09:14,890
Use about 20 grams of aloe leaves

41
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:26,888
take 200ml of water

42
00:09:30,887 --> 00:09:39,885
Crush aloe vera leaves in water

43
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:58,882
Soak in this aloe vera juice for 20 minutes

44
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:26,876
Take it out and dry it

45
00:10:28,876 --> 00:10:32,875
Wait for it to dry completely

46
00:10:46,872 --> 00:11:01,869
Use candles to apply to the cut so that the orchid does not lose water and does not rot

47
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:15,900
Use 1 teaspoon of turmeric powder

48
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:26,898
add 800ml water

49
00:11:42,894 --> 00:11:49,893
Soak moss in turmeric water to remove disease fungi and bacteria in the media

50
00:11:49,893 --> 00:11:51,893
wait 20 minutes

51
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:18,887
Recycle recycled plastic bottles to make orchid propagating tools

52
00:12:46,882 --> 00:12:51,881
Put the orchid branch in and remember to rotate the orchid branch upwards

53
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,879
Spray moisturizing mist every 5 days

54
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:13,876
Cover and put in a cool place

55
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,874
AFTER 3 WEEKS

56
00:13:28,873 --> 00:13:37,872
Small orchid sprouts have grown

57
00:13:49,869 --> 00:13:54,868
Continue misting to moisturize every 5 days

58
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:58,867
Continue to cover and place in a cool place

59
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:14,898
AFTER THE NEXT 1.5 MONTHS

60
00:14:19,897 --> 00:14:33,894
Small orchids are already quite large

61
00:14:41,892 --> 00:14:43,892
Continue misting to moisturize every 5 days

62
00:14:44,892 --> 00:14:48,891
Close the lid and continue to keep in a cool place

63
00:15:02,888 --> 00:15:05,887
AFTER THE NEXT 1.5 MONTHS

64
00:15:05,887 --> 00:15:16,885
The small orchid has grown healthy,

65
00:15:24,884 --> 00:15:33,882
finished enough leaves and roots

66
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:59,877
Now we bring it out and plant it under normal conditions for the plant to grow

67
00:16:16,873 --> 00:16:20,873
Reuse recycled plastic bottles to make orchid pots,

68
00:16:20,873 --> 00:16:29,871
This also helps to reduce environmental pollution.

69
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:53,899
Add some moss on top for moisture

70
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:59,898
Add 300 ml of water to the mixed aloe vera juice

71
00:16:59,898 --> 00:17:03,897
Add 300 ml of water to the mixed aloe vera juice

72
00:17:06,897 --> 00:17:22,894
Irrigate with freshly brewed aloe vera water.

73
00:17:22,894 --> 00:17:30,892
With this planting method, orchids will grow very quickly

74
00:17:30,892 --> 00:17:37,891
So with this simple way you can propagate orchids at home very easily

75
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:49,888
Now take care of it like any other orchid

76
00:17:49,888 --> 00:17:57,887
Hope the video will be useful for you to take better care of orchids at home

77
