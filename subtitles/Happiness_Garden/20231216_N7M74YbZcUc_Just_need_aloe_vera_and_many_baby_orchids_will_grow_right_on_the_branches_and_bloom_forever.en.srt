Hello friends

2
00:00:04,875 --> 00:00:12,865
In my hand is a wilted orchid branch, the flowers have all fallen

3
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:24,622
But in this place can still sprout

4
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:30,863
so I will cut this sprout to propagate

5
00:00:58,783 --> 00:01:06,867
I use 1 teaspoon of cinnamon powder

6
00:01:07,812 --> 00:01:13,534
Add 1 liter of boiled water

7
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,347
Wait for it to cool

8
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:33,039
After cooling, filter out the residue

9
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:52,145
Soak moss in cinnamon water for 30 minutes

10
00:01:55,665 --> 00:02:01,134
Use 1 aloe leaf

11
00:02:22,045 --> 00:02:28,319
100ml of water at room temperature

12
00:02:35,091 --> 00:02:42,157
1 Tablet of Vitamin B1

13
00:02:53,407 --> 00:03:00,734
Mix B1 water with aloe vera leaves

14
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:09,862
puree

15
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:30,000
Soak orchid branches in aloe vera and B1 water for 20 minutes

16
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:47,378
After soaking for 20 minutes, remove the branches

17
00:03:48,536 --> 00:03:56,473
Dry the orchid branch

18
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:19,101
Dip the tip of the cut into the molten candle solution

19
00:04:19,101 --> 00:04:26,281
This helps the cut heal quickly and the orchid does not rot

20
00:04:29,331 --> 00:04:38,534
After soaking for 30 minutes, proceed to remove the moss

21
00:04:39,827 --> 00:04:51,088
then mix aloe vera juice and B1 with moss

22
00:04:51,088 --> 00:05:07,120
B1 and aloe vera juice promote sprouting and rooting very well

23
00:05:22,017 --> 00:05:31,220
Put moss in a transparent jar

24
00:05:39,813 --> 00:05:44,583
plant branches like this

25
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:52,768
Packed in transparent nylon

26
00:06:06,752 --> 00:06:14,867
Then put it in a cool place, away from direct sunlight

27
00:06:22,304 --> 00:06:25,291
1 MONTH LATER

28
00:06:33,085 --> 00:06:39,201
Orchid sprouts grow very well

29
00:06:53,674 --> 00:07:00,000
I continue to plant in this jar

30
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:09,014
From now on, it is necessary to spray moisturizing mist every 5 days

31
00:07:41,088 --> 00:07:44,075
NEXT 1 MONTHS

32
00:08:08,563 --> 00:08:16,539
Orchids grow very well

33
00:08:18,168 --> 00:08:26,067
If you find it interesting, please like, share and subscribe to my channel to support me

34
00:08:26,493 --> 00:08:33,465
Roots grow very healthy

35
00:08:33,465 --> 00:08:40,064
Now let's plant the orchid outdoors to let it grow naturally

36
00:08:40,064 --> 00:08:45,563
Wish you success and always happy in life
