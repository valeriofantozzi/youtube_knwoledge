Welcome to my channel.

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,360
When you grow orchids, it is unavoidable

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:13,280
that the leaves may rot.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,759
If your orchid's leaves are rotting like

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,920
this, don't worry because in this video,

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:22,560
I'm sharing a new method to help you

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,320
quickly treat leaf rot in time.

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,640
First, you need to cut off the rotting

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,400
part of the leaf from the orchid. This

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,760
helps prevent the rot from spreading to

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,760
the stem and other healthy leaves.

12
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,520
Then we check the roots and remove any

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,800
rotten ones from the orchid. This helps

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,399
prevent the rot from spreading

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,840
throughout the entire plant from the

16
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,840
roots to the stem and leaves.

43
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:30,520
Uh, it's best to check the orchid once a

44
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,520
week to remove yellow or rotting leaves.

45
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,160
For orchids with rotting leaves caused

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,879
by bacteria, we need to isolate them

47
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,640
from the garden to treat the rot. This

48
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,879
helps prevent the rot from spreading to

49
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,879
other plants.

50
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,879
Now I am using turmeric powder because

51
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,599
it has excellent natural antibacterial

52
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:04,440
and anti-inflammatory properties which

53
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,440
are great for treating orchid leaf rot.

[Music]

55
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:18,200
Apply turmeric powder to the cut as it

56
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,200
helps the wound heal quickly.

57
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,680
This helps reduce the risk of infection

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,680
and aids the plant in recovering

59
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,680
quickly.

[Music]

61
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,799
Moreover, turmeric helps stimulate the

62
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,720
process of cell regeneration, allowing

63
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,599
the cut to heal quickly and the plant to

64
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,599
return to a healthy state.

65
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,959
Then place it in a well ventilated area

66
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,959
and avoid watering to help the cut heal

67
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,959
quickly.

68
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,759
Then add one teaspoon of turmeric powder

69
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,600
into a bottle and mix it with four cups

70
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,600
of hot water, about one liter.

71
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,479
Cover the bottle and wait for the water

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,479
to cool down.

73
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,960
This is oatmeal which can be used as a

74
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,960
very good natural fertilizer for

75
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,960
orchids.

76
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,680
Take 1 tbsp of oatmeal powder and mix it

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,880
with four cups of room temperature

78
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,880

79
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,880
Wait for about 2 hours to allow the

80
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,660
nutrients to fully dissolve into the

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,680
You can use a sieve or a thin cloth to

filter, ensuring that only clean liquid

87
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,440

[Music]

95
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,080
The first step is to soak a cotton ball

96
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,759
in the turmeric water mixture and gently

97
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,240
wipe both the top and bottom of the

98
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,240
orchid leaves.

99
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,800
Wiping the leaves with turmeric water

100
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,800
not only helps clean the leaves but also

101
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,039
provides nutrients that keep the leaves

102
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,120
healthy. Additionally, it has

103
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,280
anti-inflammatory and antibacterial

104
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,280
properties helping the leaves avoid

105
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,280
diseases.

106
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,639
You should wipe evenly and gently to

107
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,639
avoid damaging the leaves.

108
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,720
Turmeric contains curcumin which helps

109
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,199
reduce inflammation and prevent the

110
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,599
growth of harmful bacteria and fungi on

111
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,599
the leaves. This helps the plant fight

112
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,599
against diseases such as leaf rot and

113
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,599
mold.

114
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,319
Curcumin and turmeric also has

115
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,000
antioxidant properties, protecting the

116
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,880
leaves from the harmful effects of the

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,560
environment and strong sunlight, helping

118
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,560
the orchid leaves maintain their

119
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,560
freshness.

120
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,919
To care for orchids effectively, you can

121
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,280
wipe the leaves with turmeric water

122
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,280
about one to two times a month.

123
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,160
Step two, pour the turmeric water into a

124
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,879
spray bottle. Then spray it onto the

125
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,879
entire orchid plant.

126
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,479
Um, this helps the turmeric water cover

127
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,080
the leaves, roots, and stem evenly,

128
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,200
providing nutrients and protecting the

129
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,200
plant from harmful agents.

130
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,440
Regularly spraying turmeric water helps

131
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:56,519
the orchid maintain its health, reduce

132
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,519
inflammation, and prevent mold growth.

133
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,800
You should spray turmeric water on the

134
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,800
orchid about one to two times a month.

135
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,200
This is enough to provide the plant with

136
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,200
nutrients from turmeric while also

137
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,920
protecting the leaves from bacteria and

138
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,560
fungi without causing excess moisture to

139
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,560
linger too long.

140
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,920
Um, if the plant has health issues or is

141
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,519
infected, you can do it more frequently,

142
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,800
but for healthy plants, a frequency of

143
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,800
one two times a month is ideal.

144
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,640
Now, mixing turmeric water with oatmeal

145
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,240
water is a great way to create a

146
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,240
natural, nutrient-rich mixture for

147
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,240
orchids.

148
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,920
Oatmeal water is rich in vitamins and

149
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,839
minerals, providing essential nutrients

150
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,160
for the plant's healthy growth. While

151
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,710

174
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,720
Moss has excellent moisture retention,

175
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:23,160
so you only need to water with this

176
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,160
mixture once every 2 weeks.

177
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,880
With moss as the growing medium, you

178
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,680
don't need to water too frequently

179
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,360
because it retains water longer, helping

180
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,839
to maintain a stable moisture level for

181
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,839

However, if your orchid's growing medium

184
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,760
is bark chips, it drains water faster.

185
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,000
So, you will need to water with this

186
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,640
mixture once a week to ensure the plant

187
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,640
receives enough nutrients.

188
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,680
Bark chips don't retain moisture as well

189
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,839
as moss, so more frequent watering is

190
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:17,480
needed to ensure the plant doesn't lack

191
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,480
water and nutrients.

192
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:24,219
[Music]

193
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,959
Step four. After watering the plant with

194
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,959
the turmeric and oatmeal mixture, you

195
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:43,240
should wipe off any remaining mixture on

196
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,240
the leaves and leaf axles.

197
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,079
Uh this is an important step to prevent

198
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,560
the mixture from remaining on on the

199
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,000
plant which could create prolonged

200
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,760
moisture and provide favorable

201
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,760
conditions for mold or bacterial growth.

202
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,560
Um, you can use a soft cloth or cotton

203
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,399
ball to gently wipe away any excess,

204
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,880
ensuring that areas like the top and

205
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:19,880
bottom of the leaves and the leaf axles

206
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,880
are dry and not left wet for too long.

207
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,800
This helps the orchid maintain its

208
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,120
health, prevents mold, and keeps the

209
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,120
leaves clean.

210
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,079
After wiping off the excess mixture, you

211
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,880
should place the orchid pot in a spot

212
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,639
with gentle sunlight as light is a

213
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:47,959
crucial factor that helps the orchid

214
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,959
perform photosynthesis and grow well.

215
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,639
However, you should avoid direct and

216
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,760
intense sunlight as it can cause leaf

217
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,760
burn or stress the plant.

218
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,399
[Music]

219
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,480
Now, let's take a look at the results

220
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,800
after 2 months of caring for the orchid.

221
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,720
The with it with the natural fertilizer

222
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,500
mixture made from turmeric powder and

223
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,839
oatmeal.

224
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:16,000
[Music]

225
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,160
You can see that my orchid pot has grown

226
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,800
three new flower spikes, all thick and

227
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,880
healthy. This shows that the natural

228
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:28,519
fertilizer made from turmeric powder and

229
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:28,519
oatmeal has truly had an amazing effect.

230
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,360
Not only has it produced many new flower

231
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,040
spikes, but it's also developed many new

232
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,800
roots.

233
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,720
This proves that the plant is very

234
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,519
healthy and receiving enough nutrients

235
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,519
from the natural fertilizer.

236
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:52,800
[Music]

237
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,440
New roots help the orchid absorb water

238
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,199
and nutrients more efficiently, which in

239
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,760
turn helps the plant grow better and

240
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,760
maintain its health.

241
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,680
The strong growth of the flower spikes

242
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,920
is a sign that the plant is receiving

243
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:16,360
all the necessary nutrients and the care

244
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,360
environment is perfect for its growth.

245
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,160
This orchid, although smaller, has grown

246
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,399
two flower spikes after 2 months of

247
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,399
careful care, which is a very positive

248
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,399
sign.

249
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,040
This proves that although the plant

250
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,440
doesn't grow as vigorously as the

251
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,759
others, with the right care and natural

252
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,399
fertilizer, it can still bloom and

253
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,399
recover its health.

254
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,800
Uh this is a clear example that patience

255
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:15,480
and careful care will help the plant

256
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,480
recover and produce beautiful blooms.

257
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,279
Here's another regular orchid. And when

258
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,120
cared for using this method, you can

259
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:33,720
clearly see the difference. The leaves

260
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,720
are vibrant, firm, and healthy.

261
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:53,170
The flower spikes are not only large but

262
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,120
also thick and full of vitality.

263
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:57,040
[Music]

264
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,360
This care method has helped the plant

265
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,519
grow vigorously and bloom brilliantly,

266
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,720
proving its exceptional effectiveness in

267
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,720
nurturing and caring for orchids.

268
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,160
With this simple method, you can easily

269
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,679
care for and revive orchids right at

270
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,000
home, helping them grow healthily and

271
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,000
bloom beautifully.
