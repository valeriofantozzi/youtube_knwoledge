Hello orchid lovers!

2
00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:15,997
Today, we will explore together the secret of orchid watering,

3
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:24,929
so that they always bloom and grow with magical roots.

4
00:00:26,236 --> 00:00:32,227
With a little patience and care,

5
00:00:32,227 --> 00:00:42,226
You will find that taking care of these plants is not as difficult as you think!.

6
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:52,324
First of all, the irrigation technique is not correct.

7
00:00:53,323 --> 00:01:12,066
Do not water directly from the faucet for orchids like this.

8
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:37,400
And you should not water directly on the top of the orchid like this.

9
00:01:40,777 --> 00:01:50,259
You should also not water directly on the flowers.

10
00:01:52,899 --> 00:02:04,817
The above 3 watering methods are easy to make orchids stamp leaves, rot leaves, and rot flowers.

11
00:02:04,817 --> 00:02:38,600
like these orchids.

12
00:02:47,620 --> 00:03:09,021
You need to observe the roots and the growing medium to decide whether to water or not.

13
00:03:09,543 --> 00:03:26,870
If the roots are still green and the substrate is still moist like this, no watering is needed.

14
00:03:36,444 --> 00:03:52,799
But when you see the roots turn white and the medium is too dry like this, you need to water the orchid immediately.

15
00:03:55,884 --> 00:04:03,942
First way.

16
00:04:07,883 --> 00:04:17,104
Soak the orchid pot in water for 20-30 minutes every month.

17
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:28,914
This helps to remove excess mineral salts in the orchid growing medium.

18
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:47,226
This also helps the orchid get the best water.

19
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:56,176
2nd way.

20
00:04:58,153 --> 00:05:08,140
You water directly on the root but do not wet the stem and leaves of the orchid.

21
00:05:12,172 --> 00:05:16,172
3rd way.

22
00:05:16,172 --> 00:05:26,898
Spray a moisturizing mist on the top and bottom of the leaves.

23
00:05:41,315 --> 00:06:00,000
In this way, after watering, you need to dry the shoots and interstitial leaves.

24
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:33,910
This way I apply regularly and the leaves are always green and clean.

25
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:47,218
 
When the orchid is watered with enough moisture and nutrition,

26
00:06:47,218 --> 00:06:59,165
it will develop a lot of flower buds like this orchid of mine.

27
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:12,663
Leaves are sturdy and disease free.

28
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:24,502
Blooming flowers are brightly colored.

29
00:07:27,023 --> 00:07:39,376
very fat flower buds.

30
00:07:40,177 --> 00:07:50,790
This helps the petals bloom wider and stay fresh longer.

31
00:07:53,259 --> 00:08:03,785
spread enough water will not wilt.

32
00:08:04,655 --> 00:08:14,003
Enough moisture roots easily absorb nutrients.

33
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:26,711
If the orchid has enough water and nutrients, the flower can be kept on the branch for up to 6 months before it falls.

34
00:08:31,627 --> 00:08:43,545
Adequate watering will help the roots grow stronger.

35
00:08:49,316 --> 00:09:02,278
Healthy roots will also better absorb water and nutrients.

36
00:09:04,016 --> 00:09:14,629
Helps orchids increase resistance to pests.
