Hello everyone, to easily care for orchids to always grow healthily.

2
00:00:16,897 --> 00:00:26,895
There are many flower buds, the flowers stay on the branches longer.

3
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:38,893
Today I share a very easy way to make orchids always grow healthily.

4
00:00:44,892 --> 00:00:52,890
lush green and flowers will bloom all year round.

5
00:00:56,889 --> 00:01:06,887
Water it once a week.

6
00:01:16,252 --> 00:01:23,884
and leave for 10 minutes.

7
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:29,883
to help the roots turn green.

8
00:01:32,882 --> 00:01:39,881
then take it out.

9
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:51,878
I use a small teaspoon of cinnamon powder mixed into 1 liter of boiled water.

10
00:01:53,878 --> 00:02:02,876
Cinnamon powder is very good, helping orchids grow very quickly.

11
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:09,875
Wait for this water to cool.

12
00:02:14,609 --> 00:02:23,872
After the water cools, will filter this water.

13
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:41,868
And I use 1 tablespoon of flour, which contains a lot of nutrients.

14
00:02:44,507 --> 00:02:51,900
Add 1 liter of water.

15
00:02:53,366 --> 00:03:01,898
The nutrients in wheat flour also help plants grow very quickly.

16
00:03:03,346 --> 00:03:10,896
and mix with cinnamon water.

17
00:03:11,563 --> 00:03:18,894
will create a great organic nutrient for orchids.

18
00:03:20,294 --> 00:03:28,892
And water immediately at the base of the tree.

19
00:03:29,892 --> 00:03:36,891
You should fertilize orchids every 2 weeks.

20
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:50,888
Use this water to spray on the leaves.

21
00:03:55,131 --> 00:04:03,886
Helps prevent insects such as thrips and mealybugs.

22
00:04:07,285 --> 00:04:16,883
You should do it early in the morning and by noon the leaves will dry very quickly.

23
00:04:19,882 --> 00:04:29,880
Leave it like that for 20 minutes.

24
00:04:32,595 --> 00:04:42,878
Wheat always contains many organic nutrients.

25
00:04:47,558 --> 00:04:55,875
Helps orchids grow healthily.

26
00:05:06,345 --> 00:05:14,871
This type of water also helps a lot for weak, underdeveloped plants.

27
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:27,869
If the orchid has been planted for many years and still hasn't bloomed, repot it.

28
00:05:36,114 --> 00:05:46,898
Cut off damaged roots.

29
00:05:55,563 --> 00:06:05,895
use this water wipe the leaves.

30
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:16,893
Helps leaves recover from fungus.

31
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:28,890
Cinnamon powder has antibacterial and antiseptic properties and wheat contains a lot of minerals.

32
00:06:32,028 --> 00:06:41,888
and essential vitamins, helping plants recover very quickly.

33
00:06:51,119 --> 00:07:00,884
Adding this amount of water helps new roots grow quickly.

34
00:07:02,134 --> 00:07:07,882
Soak in this water for 20 minutes.

35
00:07:09,308 --> 00:07:13,881
Then take it out.

36
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:20,880
Place the plant in a bright place.

37
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:32,877
Helps plants photosynthesize, create chlorophyll, keep leaves green and roots strong.

38
00:07:35,558 --> 00:07:44,875
and the flowers will bloom more beautifully.

39
00:07:53,601 --> 00:08:01,872
Hope it will always help you a lot.
