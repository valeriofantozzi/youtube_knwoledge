00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:16,897
For orchids to grow well, the roots must be strong.

3
00:00:18,897 --> 00:00:28,895
Because the roots are healthy, they can absorb more nutrients to feed the plant.

4
00:00:32,894 --> 00:00:42,892
When Lan absorbs enough nutrients, the flower will bloom.

5
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:56,889
To do that, in this video I share a very easy fertilizer.

6
00:01:06,887 --> 00:01:16,885
To make this fertilizer I will recycle potato peels as fertilizer.

7
00:01:26,883 --> 00:01:36,881
Potato peels contain many important nutrients such as potassium, fosfor and many other minerals.

8
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:52,878
Recycled fertilizer from them helps provide these nutrients to plants, helping them grow strongly.

9
00:02:02,876 --> 00:02:12,874
I used the peel of 1 potato.

10
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:32,870
and soak in 2 liters of boiled water.

11
00:02:41,868 --> 00:02:51,900
Then incubate for a day so that the nutrients are completely dissolved in the water.

12
00:02:59,898 --> 00:03:09,896
Next I used 3 cloves of garlic.

13
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:26,893
 
Garlic contains natural antibacterial compounds such as allicin,

14
00:03:26,893 --> 00:03:36,891
Helps prevent the growth of bacteria and mold in soil and on orchids.

15
00:03:50,888 --> 00:04:00,886
After cutting into small pieces, put them in a jar and soak with 2 liters of water.

16
00:04:06,885 --> 00:04:16,883
Then leave for 1 day for the nutrients to completely dissolve in the water.

17
00:04:21,882 --> 00:04:26,881
1 DAY LATER.

18
00:04:48,877 --> 00:04:58,875
Filter out residue.

19
00:05:14,871 --> 00:05:18,871
FIRST METHOD.

20
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:36,867
Apply this liquid fertilizer to the orchid roots.

21
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:55,897
Potato peels and garlic contain many important nutrients such as potassium, 

22
00:05:55,897 --> 00:06:02,895
fosfor and many other minerals.

23
00:06:08,894 --> 00:06:18,892
Their recycled fertilizer helps provide these nutrients to orchids, helping them grow strongly.

24
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:38,888
Do this every 2-3 weeks to supplement nutrients and increase disease resistance for orchids.

25
00:06:48,886 --> 00:06:51,886
SECOND METHOD.

26
00:06:53,885 --> 00:07:03,883
Spray this fertilizer on the top and bottom of the leaves and roots of the orchid.

27
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:22,879
Garlic is known for its resistance to diseases and pests.

28
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:33,932
Using recycled fertilizer from garlic helps plants prevent and fight harmful diseases and pests.

29
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:48,874
 
Using recycled fertilizer from potato peels and garlic helps reduce the need to use chemicals for orchids,

30
00:07:50,874 --> 00:08:02,872
because they provide essential nutrients for plants. This helps reduce negative impacts on the environment.

31
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:08,870
3. RESULT

32
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:22,868
After 2-3 times of fertilizing this way, the orchid will have many branched roots.

33
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:42,897
This helps the orchid easily absorb most nutrients through the roots.

34
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:58,894
By providing nutrients and improving soil structure, potato 

35
00:09:00,893 --> 00:09:08,892
and garlic fertilizers help increase the yield and quality of orchids.

36
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:25,888
Garlic and potatoes are rich in potassium, so they help orchids bloom more.

37
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:38,886
Hope it will help you a lot.
