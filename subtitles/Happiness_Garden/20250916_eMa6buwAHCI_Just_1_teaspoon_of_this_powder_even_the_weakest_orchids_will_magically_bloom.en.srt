00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,800
To make this compost, you will need

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,750
eggs. More precisely, about 10

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:01:00,800
eggshells.

25
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,479
Then wash the eggshells with water to

26
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:22,650
remove remaining egg white, keeping the

27
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:29,399
mixture clean and safe for the plant.

30
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,200
Next, place the eggshells under the sun

31
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,119
to dry completely. This step makes them

32
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,720
more brittle and easier to crush. And

33
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,360
the sunlight also helps naturally

34
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,360
disinfect them.

[Music]

36
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,799
After about 3 hours of sun drying, the

37
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,319
eggshells are completely dry and ready

38
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,480
for the next step.

39
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,120
Now, just crush them first and then

40
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,959
grind them finely. The finer the shells,

41
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,380
the easier it will be for the plant to

42
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:29,730
absorb the nutrients and grow better.

After grinding finally, take one

48
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,319
teaspoon of the eggshell powder and put

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,239
it into a clean bottle. This will be the

50
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,920
main ingredient for making the watering

51
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,680
solution for the orchids.

After adding the eggshell powder to the

54
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,920
clean bottle, pour in about four cups of

55
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,560
boiling water, equivalent to one liter

56
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,080
of water. Stir well so that the

57
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,480
nutrients in the eggshells are

58
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,480
completely dissolved.

60
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,360
After stirring well, close the lid

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,680
tightly and let it sit until the

62
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,440
solution cools completely. This step

63
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,959
helps the minerals in the eggshells

64
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,959
blend into the water more effectively.

[Music]

66
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,760
When the water has completely cooled,

67
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,840
strain out the eggshell residue and keep

68
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,920
the clear liquid. This is the calcium

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,810
and mineralrich solution to water your

70
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:37,100
orchids.

[Music]

72
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,600
The first method is to use a soft cloth

73
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,680
soaked in this solution. Then gently

74
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,940
wipe both the upper and lower surfaces

75
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,620
of the leaves.

[Music]

77
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,560
Eggshells contain a lot of calcium, an

78
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,639
important mineral for orchid growth.

79
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,080
Calcium helps form new tissues, makes

80
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,639
the leaves thicker and stronger than

81
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,639
usual, and also supports strong root

82
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,639
development.

00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,720
[Music]

84
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,800
This method not only provides nutrients,

85
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,960
but also helps kill fungi and repel

86
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,600
insects effectively, keeping the plant

87
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,600
healthy and disease-free.

88
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,360
You can wipe the leaves every two weeks

89
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,840
to remove dust, helping them

90
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,759
photosynthesize better. When the leaves

91
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,160
are clean and clear, the plant will

92
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:39,080
absorb light more effectively, grow

93
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,080
stronger roots, and produce more blooms.

[Music]

95
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,680
Another tip is to wipe the leaves early

96
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,919
in the morning or late in the afternoon

97
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,240
when the sun is not too strong.

98
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,160
This allows the leaves to dry naturally,

99
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:58,600
preventing water from lingering and

100
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,600
causing rot or fungal issues.

[Music]

102
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,960
The second method is to pour this

103
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,360
mixture into a spray bottle. Then gently

104
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,520
mist the entire plant covering both the

105
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,520
upper and lower sides of the leaves so

106
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,980
the plant can absorb the nutrients more

107
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:29,600
evenly.

108
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:31,600
[Music]

109
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,440
You should mist in the early morning or

110
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,639
late afternoon when the sunlight is not

111
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,800
too harsh. This allows the leaves to dry

112
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,880
during the day, reduces the risk of

113
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,080
fungal diseases, and helps the plant

114
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,080
absorb nutrients to the fullest.

115
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,400
Maintain misting with this eggshell

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,319
mixture every 2 weeks. After just a few

117
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,720
weeks, you will see the leaves become

118
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,930
darker green, glossy, and healthy, and

119
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,019
the roots grow strong.

121
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,319
After spraying the entire plant, let it

122
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,080
air dry. This spraying method not only

123
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:14,199
provides nutrients but also keeps the

124
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,199
leaves clean and healthy.

126
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,020
The third method is to water each orchid

127
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,280
pot directly with this mixture.

129
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,759
Gently pour around the base and onto the

130
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,000
growing medium. This helps the roots

131
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,759
absorb calcium and essential minerals,

132
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,360
nourishing the plant from within and

133
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,530
preparing it well for upcoming shoots

134
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:49,670

136
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,199
The calcium from the eggshell water

137
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,800
helps enhance orchid root growth while

138
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,360
improving the ability to absorb

139
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,280
nutrients from the growing medium. As a

140
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,750
result, the plant will grow stronger and

141
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:15,980
healthier.

[Music]

143
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,919
Calcium also helps orchids increase

144
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,599
disease resistance, making the plant

145
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,479
less prone to infections and health

146
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,400
problems. As a result, the flowers will

147
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,960
retain their color and stay vibrant for

148
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,960
a longer time.

This simple habit ensures the roots and

153

leaves receive enough calcium and

154
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,080
minerals, helping the plant grow healthy

155
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,800
with glossy green leaves and more even

156
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:58,240

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,839
Uh after applying this watering method

159
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,080
for some time, you will see strong

160
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:07,800
roots, glossy green leaves, and better

161
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,800
orchid flower development.

162
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,800
The fourth method is to sprinkle the

163
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,760
eggshell powder directly onto the

164
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,760
surface of the orchid pot.

165
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,240
This method helps gradually supplement

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,720
calcium, nourish the roots and growing

167
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,800

168
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:31,480
structure, allowing better moisture

169
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,480
retention and irerration for the plant.

170
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,640
Sprinkle a moderate amount around the

171
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,440
pot surface, maintaining it regularly

172
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,760
every 2 to 3 weeks. This method helps

173
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,160
orchid roots grow strong, keeps the

174
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,160
growing medium loose, and ensures the

175
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,000
plant stays healthy. When applied

176
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,920
consistently, you will see the orchids

177
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,240
thriving and ready for new shoots and

178
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,240

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,800
of care. You can see the orchid has

182
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,640
developed many new roots. This helps the

leaves and vibrant blooms.

186
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,519
These new roots not only help the plant

194
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,320
Um, with proper care, the petals bloom

195
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,399
soft, fresh, and stay on the stem

196
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,920
longer. This allows you to enjoy the

197
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,320
vibrant beauty of the orchids for an

198
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,320
extended time.

199
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,160
When consistently applying these care

200
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,680
methods, many flowers can bloom at the

201
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,760
same time while maintaining their

202
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,800
vitality, preventing the orchids from

203
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:27,160
wilting quickly. The orchids will always

204
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,160
be vibrant and full of life.

205
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,839
These fresh flowers not only beautify

206
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,399
the space, but also demonstrate the

207
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,320
plant's strong vitality. Each bloom is

208
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,560
healthy, brightly colored, and lasts

209
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,720
longer thanks to proper care combined

210
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,360
with nutrients from the roots, leaves,

211
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,360
and growing medium.
