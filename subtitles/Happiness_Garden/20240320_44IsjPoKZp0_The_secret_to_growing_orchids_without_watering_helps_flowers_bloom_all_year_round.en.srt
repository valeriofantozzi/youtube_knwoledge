welcome to my channel.

00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:30,195
If your orchid grows forever but does not bloom.

3
00:00:30,195 --> 00:00:38,779
Please watch until the end of the video to learn this tip for growing orchids.

4
00:00:47,249 --> 00:00:57,222
First you need to take the orchid out of the pot to replant it using the new method

5
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:10,587
Remove all damaged leaves and roots

6
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:33,849
Rinsing with water helps remove dirt, mold and insects

7
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:09,275
Take 5 spoons of rice which contains many nutrients such as Protein, Phosphorus, Potassium and amino acids

8
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:21,539
Add 2 liters of water

9
00:02:54,147 --> 00:03:02,131
Soak orchids in rice water for 10 minutes

10
00:03:05,764 --> 00:03:15,762
This helps stimulate root growth and the orchid recovers quickly

11
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:30,625
Now I recycle plastic bottles as orchid nursery tools

12
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:59,429
Then plant the orchid in a new pot

13
00:06:08,894 --> 00:06:18,892
Use sterilized pine bark to grow orchids

14
00:06:52,188 --> 00:07:00,184
After planting, I watered the orchids

15
00:07:01,117 --> 00:07:11,115
This way you won't have to water it and the orchids will still grow

16
00:07:13,581 --> 00:07:21,580
The water level just touches the bottom of the orchid pot

17
00:07:23,146 --> 00:07:33,144
Spray foliar fertilizer for orchids once a week with organic fertilizer as I shared on the channel

18
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:45,682
Place the plant in a cool, well-lit place and it will grow quickly with good photosynthesis

19
00:07:46,188 --> 00:07:50,174
2 Months Later

20
00:07:51,954 --> 00:08:01,938
After 2 months the orchid has recovered and developed many flower buds

21
00:08:21,826 --> 00:08:31,832
During the care process, if you see dirty water, you need to change the water in the orchid vase

22
00:08:44,451 --> 00:08:47,429
After 3 Months

23
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:55,298
The orchids have bloomed and the plants are very healthy

24
00:09:00,442 --> 00:09:10,425
The leaves are strong, sturdy and have increased resistance to pests

25
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:20,789
The roots grow very well and do not rot

26
00:09:22,348 --> 00:09:32,320
Flowers bloom brilliantly

27
00:09:41,626 --> 00:09:50,617
The plant always has enough moisture so that the flowers do not wilt

28
00:09:53,442 --> 00:10:00,881
Therefore, the flowers stick on the branches for a long time and can last up to a year before wilting.
