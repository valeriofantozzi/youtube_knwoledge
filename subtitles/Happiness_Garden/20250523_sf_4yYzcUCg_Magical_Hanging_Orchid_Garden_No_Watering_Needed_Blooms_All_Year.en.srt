Welcome to my

00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,799
channel. Phelinopsis orchids are known

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,679
for their ability to keep flowers on the

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,920
stem for a long time. The flowers are

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:15,719
beautiful, so they are loved by many

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,719

along. Let's get

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,559
started. To make a hanging orchid

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,280
garden, I recycle old plastic bottles

16
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,200
into planting pots. This method not only

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,800
helps reduce plastic waste and protect

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,540
the environment, but also creates

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,879
beautiful and unique orchid

21
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:02,079

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,079

00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,200

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,880
busy people to still satisfy their

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,400
passion for growing orchids without

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,400
worrying about daily maintenance and

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,400

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,320
With this method, you won't need to

32
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,360
bloom all four

Use high water absorbent cotton fabric

Uh, this is the hook for hanging the

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,000
orchid

62
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,759

63
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,759

Uh these are plastic beads commonly used

69
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:43,080
for hydroponic vegetable growing. I use

70
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:47,459
them as the growing medium for orchids.

73
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,759
This wick has the task of drawing water

74
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,440
from the lower layer up, keeping the

75
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,940
growing medium at an ideal moisture

76
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:21,060
level for the orchid to grow best.

[Music]

78
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,600
Now I plant the orchid seedlings into

79
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:35,980
the semi-hydroponic orchid pots.

[Music]

84
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,680
With this method, you only need to water

85
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,400
once and then you can be assured no need

86
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,720
to water

87
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,319
[Music]

88
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,160
again. The wick draws water from below,

89
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,950
helping the orchid pot always maintain

90
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,919
stable

00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:23,599

92
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:26,160
moisture. When the water runs out, you

93
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,759
just need to add water or replace it

94
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,960
after each time you spray natural

95
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,240
fertilizer on the

96
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:36,120
orchids. Then you hang the orchid pot in

97
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,120
a place with gentle sunlight.

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,640
The most suitable temperature for

100
00:08:43,200 --> 00:09:06,080
orchids is from 20 to 30°.

102
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,680
You should spray natural fertilizer on

103
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,070
the orchids about two to three times a

104
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:35,040
