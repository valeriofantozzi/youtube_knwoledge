Welcome to the happiness garden where

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,799
every petal tells a little story of love

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,639
and patience.

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,519
Today I want to share with you a simple

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,840
yet truly magical secret. Feed your

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,759
orchid this way and you'll witness

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,720
something wonderful. Your plant will

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,640
bloom more beautifully than ever before.

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,400
You don't need expensive fertilizers or

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,240
complicated methods. With just a little

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,199
care and the right approach, your orchid

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,000
will thrive with vitality, grow strong,

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,650
and burst into blossoms that melt your

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,280
heart.

[Music]

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,120
This is an orchid that has finished

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,000
blooming, but don't worry, its beauty

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,840
hasn't ended yet. Right now, I'm going

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,520
to share with you a special way to care

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,600
for it, so the plant can continue to

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,079
grow strong and soon bloom again with

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,800
vibrant, radiant flowers, just like its

23
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,800
first time. Here

24
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,760
you can see a leaf that has turned

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,760
yellow. The cause might be snails or

26
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,479
small insects biting the leaf, which

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,560
damages the plant and makes it more

28
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,600
susceptible to bacterial infection,

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,439
leading to leaf rot. In this case, we

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,280
need to gently cut off the rotten part

31
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,200
of the leaf to prevent the disease from

32
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,080
spreading and to help the plant recover

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,759
more quickly.

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,360
When checking the growing medium, I

35
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,840
found that the roots are still healthy

36
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,720
and firmly attached.

37
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,159
The substrate is still loose and clean,

38
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,079
so there's no need to replace it right

39
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,840
now.

40
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,840
It's important to only repot when the

41
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,560
roots show signs of rot or the medium

42
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,180
has decomposed. Otherwise, let the plant

43
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,479
continue growing naturally.

[Music]

45
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,200
The first ingredient I need to care for

46
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,200
the leaves is a lime. Of course, if you

47
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,640
have a lemon instead, you can use it,

48
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:02,079
too. Both work equally well.

49
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:04,079
[Music]

50
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,799
Squeeze about 1 teaspoon of fresh lime

51
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,879
juice. This tiny amount of liquid works

52
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,720
wonders. It helps clean the surface of

53
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:14,360
the leaves, removing dust and bacteria

54
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,360
that cling to them.

56
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,360
Uh after getting the lime juice, I'll

57
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,740
add about 100 ml of clean water to

58
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,120
dilute it.

[Music]

60
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,319
And the next ingredient I need is

61
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,879
coconut oil. Just add about three small

62
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,959
drops into the mixture. Then stir well

63
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,200
so all the ingredients blend together.

64
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,200
Coconut oil helps make the orchid leaves

65
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,640
shinier while forming a natural

66
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,560
protective layer that keeps them

67
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,719
moisturized and healthy for longer.

After stirring the mixture well, use a

70
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,640
soft cloth to gently soak up the diluted

71
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,560
lime and coconut oil solution.

72
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,560
Then carefully wipe both the top and

73
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,360
underside of the leaves to remove dust

74
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,599
and let the nutrients absorb evenly.

75
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,360
Just take your time and do it gently.

76
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,680
You'll soon notice your orchid's leaves

77
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,680
becoming shinier and healthier day by

78
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,680

79
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,840
When wiping the leaves with the lime and

80
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,400
coconut oil mixture, the layer of dust

81
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,560
on the surface will be removed. This

82
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,840
allows the leaves to breathe better and

83
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,400
enhances photosynthesis, contributing to

84
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:47,999
the overall nourishment of the plant.

leaves, making the orchid look fresh and

89
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,439
full of vitality. With shiny, healthy

90
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,959

of bacteria and fungi on the leaves.

97
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,680
Combined with coconut oil, the leaves

roots and the growing medium, making it

120
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,520
easier for the plant to absorb water. At

naturally soak in for about 20 minutes.

128

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,440
Uh to make a fertilizer that stimulates

143
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,680
blooming, I usually use banana peels

144
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,840
when eating bananas. Banana peels are

145
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,360
not only rich in potassium and essential

146
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,919
minerals, but also help the orchid

147
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,560
develop buds and flowers evenly, lasting

148
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,560
longer.

149
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,440
First, wash the banana peel thoroughly

150
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,840
to remove any dirt and bacteria. This

151
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,160
ensures that when making the fertilizer,

152
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,160
the orchid receives nutrients safely and

153
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,160
effectively.

pieces and put them into a clean jar to

169
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,199

170
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,360
helps the nutrients dissolve into the

173
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,319
Uh the final ingredient for the roots is

174
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,319
rice. Rice not only provides energy but

175
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,000
also helps stimulate the orchid roots to

176
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,840
grow strong, firm, and healthy.

177
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,390
Add about 3 teaspoons of rice into the

178
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:40,720

After adding the rice to the jar, pour

181
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,240
in about one liter of clean water. The

182
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,480
water helps dissolve the nutrients from

183
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,800
the banana peel and rice, creating a

184
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,040
natural energy richch fertilizer for

185
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,040
your orchid.

186
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,800
After stirring the mixture well, cover

187
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,760
the jar and let it sit for about 1 to

188
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,920
two hours. This soaking process allows

rice to fully blend into the water,

191
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,760
creating an energy richch solution ready

192
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,240
to nourish the orchid roots and promote

193
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,240
healthy growth.

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,120
After soaking for about 2 hours, stir

196
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,279
the mixture once more. Then strain out

This step makes the solution clear and

200
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,800
easy to use while ensuring the nutrients

201
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,360
are fully dissolved and ready to nourish

202
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,440
the orchid roots effectively.

203
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,440
With just a few simple steps, you now

204
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,440
have a natural nutrient-rich fertilizer

205
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,680
that supports healthy roots and overall

206
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,680
plant growth.

Once the solution is ready, pour the

210
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,880
mixture directly onto the roots and

211
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,519
growing medium twice a month.

[Music]

213
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,440
Uh the mixture of rice and banana peel

214
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,839
provides essential nutrients helping the

215
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,040
orchid roots grow long, firm, and

216
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,880
healthy. Healthy roots absorb water and

217
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,560
nutrients more efficiently, creating a

218
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,560
solid foundation for overall plant

219
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,560
growth.

220
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,839
As the roots absorb nutrients from this

221
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,640
mixture, the orchid leaves become lush

222
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,720
and glossy. Healthy leaves are not only

223
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,120
visually appealing, but also ensure good

224
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:05,480
photosynthesis, supplying energy for the

225
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,480
entire plant and its flowers.

226
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,560
The nutrients from rice and banana peel

227
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,040
help the plant form buds evenly and

228
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,279
firmly, reducing the risk of early bud

229
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,279
drop. The plant has enough energy to

230
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:23,160
develop uniform buds, preparing for

231
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,160
vibrant, healthy blooms.

232
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,440
Or you can also pour this mixture into a

233
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,000
spray bottle. This allows you to spray

234
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,920
evenly onto the roots and growing medium

235
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,880
while easily controlling the amount of

236
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,800
fertilizer to avoid excess.

237
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,959
Using a spray bottle is also convenient

238
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,959
for smaller orchid pots, helping the

239
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:49,480
nutrients penetrate evenly and be

240
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,480
absorbed more effectively by the roots.

the entire plant, nourishing the roots

249
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,279
while also caring for the leaves and

250
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:29,639

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,680
you can also soak the orchid pot in the

255
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,519
fertilizer mixture for about 20 minutes.

256
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,639
Soaking allows the roots and growing

257
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,560
medium to absorb nutrients more deeply,

258
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,920
enhancing the overall nourishment of the

259
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:58,959
entire plant.

After wiping and draining, place the

269
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,480
orchid pot in a spot with gentle

270
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,720
sunlight. Soft light helps the plant

271
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,839
photosynthesize effectively, keeping the

272
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,000
leaves lush and green and the roots

273
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,560
strong while also preparing the plant

274
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,639
for blooming. Remember, no matter how

275
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,560

276
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,480

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,600
become shinier and firmer than before,

284
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:07,090

orchid has produced two very healthy new

289
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,560
shoots. These young shoots are a clear

290
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,959
sign that the plant is growing

291
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,959
vigorously from roots to leaves,

292
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,680

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,560
the entire plant every 2 weeks. This

310
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,959
regular care ensures the roots, leaves,

311
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,440

314
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,760
this routine, the plant will stay lush
