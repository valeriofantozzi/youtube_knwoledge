00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,895
Welcome to my channel

2
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:33,894
In my hand is an orchid with leaf rot disease

3
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:43,892
We need to remove rotten leaves from the garden so that it does not spread the rot to other orchids

4
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:59,889
Now I will show you how to revive a rotten orchid like this.

5
00:01:05,887 --> 00:01:12,886
Then cut off all damaged roots

6
00:01:15,885 --> 00:01:21,884
This will help the orchid roots escape further root rot

7
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:16,873
I keep only the fresh roots that are left over

8
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:41,868
then rinse with water

9
00:03:02,898 --> 00:03:09,896
Then leave the orchid branch in a cool place for 1 day to let the cut heal completely

10
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:16,895
Use 2 cloves of garlic and mince

11
00:03:52,888 --> 00:04:00,886
Soak garlic in 1 liter of water at room temperature

12
00:04:00,886 --> 00:04:05,885
Incubate for 1 day

13
00:04:10,381 --> 00:04:15,883
1 DAY AFTER

14
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,879
Filter the garlic water

15
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:20,870
Soak orchid branches in garlic water for 20 minutes

16
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:40,900
Pour the remaining garlic liquid into the jar

17
00:05:56,896 --> 00:06:03,895
The rest of the water I will spray on other orchids to help protect the orchid from insects and fungi

18
00:06:10,894 --> 00:06:17,892
At the same time, garlic juice also stimulates the development of roots and flower sprouts very well

19
00:06:20,892 --> 00:06:26,891
Spray the underside of the leaves thoroughly because this is where insects 

20
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:32,889
and fungi often hide, leaving orchids behind

21
00:06:45,443 --> 00:06:51,886
Caring for it this way, my orchid has a very healthy root system

22
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,884
20 MINUTES AFTER

23
00:07:08,882 --> 00:07:15,881
Use soft cotton to dry the orchid roots

24
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:52,874
Then plant orchids with dry pine bark

25
00:07:52,874 --> 00:08:00,872
At the bottom of the pot I spread large pine bark to help the roots breathe

26
00:08:02,894 --> 00:08:08,870
On top I spread small pieces of pine to help retain moisture better

27
00:08:19,868 --> 00:08:26,900
Dried pine bark will help absorb moisture from the orchid roots, dry the cut, and help the cut heal quickly

28
00:09:08,892 --> 00:09:16,890
Then leave in a cool place and do not water for 1 week

29
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:35,886
1 WEEK LATER

30
00:09:40,885 --> 00:09:46,884
Spread a little moss on top of the orchid pot to help retain moisture better

31
00:10:20,878 --> 00:10:26,876
From now on, water the orchid to keep it moist

32
00:10:50,872 --> 00:10:58,870
Recycle clear plastic bottles to make greenhouses for growing orchids

33
00:11:04,869 --> 00:11:10,868
Remember to water when the growing medium is dry

34
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:26,898
Place the orchid pot in a cool, well-lit place to help the orchid photosynthesize

35
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:33,896
Results after 3 weeks

36
00:11:38,895 --> 00:11:46,894
So after 3 weeks of incubation in the greenhouse, the orchid has germinated and given new roots

37
00:12:13,888 --> 00:12:20,887
Once the plant has sprouted and roots, I use GE solution to take care of it

38
00:12:20,887 --> 00:12:26,886
Ge solution is a microbial fertilizer made from banana and aloe vera

39
00:12:26,886 --> 00:12:33,885
Contains many enzymes and amino acids that are very good for orchid growth

40
00:12:40,883 --> 00:12:46,882
Take 36 spoons of GE mixed with 1 liter of water

41
00:13:30,873 --> 00:13:36,872
Water this liquid fertilizer for orchids every 2 weeks

42
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:50,869
GE fertilizer is very good for recovering weak orchids

43
00:13:52,869 --> 00:13:58,868
It also helps plants detoxify when using too much chemical fertilizer

44
00:14:17,897 --> 00:14:23,896
Continue caring for orchids in this miniature greenhouse

45
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:30,895
And remember to water every time the orchid growing medium dries out

46
00:14:33,894 --> 00:14:40,893
The substrate is always moist but not waterlogged, good for orchid roots

47
00:14:47,891 --> 00:14:53,890
Use the remaining liquid fertilizer to water other orchids

48
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:06,888
Applying once every 2 weeks will be very good for your orchids

49
00:15:16,886 --> 00:15:23,884
GE bananas and aloe vera also provide natural potassium to help orchids bloom for a long time

50
00:15:39,881 --> 00:15:43,880
Results after 2 months

51
00:15:50,112 --> 00:15:56,878
The roots have grown very well

52
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:05,876
The leaves are sturdy and bright green

53
00:16:06,876 --> 00:16:12,874
From this dying orchid, a healthy orchid was miraculously revived

54
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:30,871
With strong roots like this,

55
00:16:30,871 --> 00:16:36,870
We fertilize orchids with organic fertilizer like I shared to help orchids grow healthier.
