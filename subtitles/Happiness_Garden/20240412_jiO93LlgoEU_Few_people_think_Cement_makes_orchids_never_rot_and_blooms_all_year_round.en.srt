Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:16,897
In this video, I share how to treat rotten orchids.

3
00:00:16,897 --> 00:00:24,896
and take care of weak orchids to bloom all year round.

4
00:00:25,627 --> 00:00:28,895
Let's start.

5
00:00:31,476 --> 00:00:40,892
This orchid has a very severe leaf rot disease.

6
00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:48,058
This rot spreads very quickly.

7
00:00:56,084 --> 00:01:03,888
First you need to cut off all rotten leaves.

8
00:01:39,248 --> 00:01:50,879
Then use antibacterial and antiseptic cement to sprinkle on the cut.

9
00:01:50,879 --> 00:02:00,243
Just apply it once to completely cure the disease.

10
00:02:03,876 --> 00:02:14,874
Then leave in a cool place for 5 days without watering for the orchid to recover.

11
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:29,871
And here the orchid has finished blooming, the plant becomes weak and the leaves are wrinkled.

12
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:48,867
Cut off all dried flower stems.

13
00:02:58,898 --> 00:03:08,316
and cut off all damaged roots.

14
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:22,894
Adding shredded pine bark helps retain moisture better.

15
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:48,055
Then take 1 clove of garlic and cut it into thin slices.

16
00:04:11,228 --> 00:04:19,882
Put in a jar and pour in 1 liter of warm water.

17
00:04:28,881 --> 00:04:36,879
And here is the soy sauce "BRAGG - Liquid Aminos"

18
00:04:37,246 --> 00:04:45,244
It has the effect of enhancing the resistance of plants to unusual environmental impacts 

19
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:52,842
(drought, high temperature, intense sunlight, shock when plants change growth stages,...)

20
00:04:52,842 --> 00:05:00,874
and especially plants are poisoned by inorganic fertilizers, environmental pollution, etc.

21
00:05:02,362 --> 00:05:09,339
 
Mix 1 spoon of soy sauce

22
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:22,870
Then leave it for 1 day before using it.

23
00:05:32,243 --> 00:05:36,867
1 Day later.

24
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:56,896
Mix in 2 liters of water.

25
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:14,893
Step 1: Thoroughly wipe the top and bottom of the leaves with this water.

26
00:06:18,073 --> 00:06:28,890
Helps eliminate fungal diseases, harmful insects and at the same time adds nutrition through leaves to orchids.

27
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:40,888
The stomata become clear, helping orchids photosynthesize better.

28
00:06:42,692 --> 00:06:52,885
Step 2: Water the orchid roots with this liquid fertilizer 1-2 times a month.

29
00:06:57,228 --> 00:07:06,216
Helps detoxify orchid roots and prevent shock very effectively.

30
00:07:15,253 --> 00:07:20,880
3 Weeks Later

31
00:07:24,115 --> 00:07:33,877
After being detoxified, the roots grow very quickly.

32
00:07:33,877 --> 00:07:41,876
This helps the orchid quickly absorb water and nutrients.

33
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:55,873
Therefore, the tree recovers quickly and the leaves become stronger.

34
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:22,868
These are weak orchid pots after 3 months of care using this method.

35
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:32,667
The roots grow very healthy and the flowers continue to bloom with many brilliant flowers.

36
00:08:34,328 --> 00:08:42,297
With this simple method, you can take care of orchids at home very easily.

37
00:08:42,297 --> 00:08:51,173
