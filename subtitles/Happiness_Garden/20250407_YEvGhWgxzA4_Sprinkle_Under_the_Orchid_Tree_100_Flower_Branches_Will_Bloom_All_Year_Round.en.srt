00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,359
Welcome to my

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,440
garden. Today I continue sharing how to

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,360
revive weak orchids after blooming using

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,759
natural fertilizer, helping them keep

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,240
growing and bloom vigorously in the next

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,240
flowering

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,720
season. This is the orchid after it has

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,279
finished blooming for the previous

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,600
season. It continues to produce new buds

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,300
from the old flower spike, but the plant

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,160
has become weakened.

12
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:31,039
[Music]

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,559
Its leaves became soft and wilted,

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,559
looking so pitiful. That's why I bought

15
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,040
this orchid from a local orchid shop at

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,000
a negligible clearance price to bring it

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,000
home and revive

18
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:45,280
it. First, I need to remove the old

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,840
plastic pot to check the root system and

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,840
repot the

21
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,480
orchid. We need to check if the roots

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,800
are damaged by gently squeezing them.

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,879
If the roots feel firm, they are still

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,879
healthy. But if they are soft, it means

25
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,879
they have rotted and need to be removed

26
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,519
[Music]

27
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:19,320
immediately. We only cut off the damaged

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,320
roots while keeping the healthy ones.

29
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:33,580
[Music]

30
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,759
I found that only a few roots are

31
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,640
damaged and need to be removed. Most of

32
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,640
the roots are still healthy.

33
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:54,000
[Music]

34
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,840
Uh by cutting off the rotting, decayed

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,240
or damaged roots, you help stop the

36
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,920
spread of diseases and prevent the plant

37
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,920
from getting infected with fungi or

38
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,920
bacteria.

39
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,680
Moreover, this helps the plant focus its

40
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,599
energy on developing new roots, thereby

41
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,720
improving its ability to absorb water

42
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,879
and nutrients.

43
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,879
[Music]

44
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,879
Next, trim off the damaged leaves to

45
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,319
help the orchid avoid the spread of

46
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,319
diseases, mold, and

47
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:54,959
bacteria. Damaged or rotten leaves will

48
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,800
reduce the plant's ability to

49
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,519
photosynthesize, affecting its growth

50
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,519
and overall health.

51
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,000
By removing them, the plant will focus

52
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,400
its energy on nourishing the healthier

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
parts, helping it grow stronger and

54
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,000
better able to withstand external

55
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:21,440
factors. Next, trim off the wilted

56
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,920
flower spikes that no longer have the

57
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,920
ability to bloom. This helps the orchid

58
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,840
save energy and nutrients without having

59
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,840
to nourish the ineffective flower

60
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,840
spikes.

61
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,840
This will stimulate the plant to develop

62
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,599
new flower buds in the next season.

63
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,599
Additionally, removing the wilted flower

64
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:44,120
spikes also helps the orchid stay neat

65
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,120
and reduces the risk of disease.

66
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,620
[Music]

67
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,280
After removing the damaged parts of the

68
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,959
plant, you can use aloe vera to help

69
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,480
revive the wilted

70
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,080
orchid. Aloe vera has soothing and

71
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,040
antibacterial properties which help

72
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,720
protect the cuts and promote the healing

73
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,239
process. Additionally, aloe vera gel

74
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,440
retains moisture well, helping the

75
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,440
wilted orchid recover quickly.

76
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,600
You just need to cut a fresh aloe vera

77
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,880
leaf, extract the gel inside, and apply

78
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,199
it to the cuts on the plant and the

79
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,840
wilted leaves. This will help the orchid

80
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:45,560
recover quickly, reduce stress, and

81
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,560
encourage new growth.

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,120
which country you're watching from. It's

84
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,840
amazing that we can chat together from

85

all around the world.

86
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,320
You can apply aloe vera gel to the

87
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,880
wilted leaves every 2 days depending on

88
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,479
the plant's condition. If the orchid is

89
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,720
recovering well, you can reduce the

90
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,720
frequency to once every 5 days.

91
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,000
After applying the aloe vera gel to the

92
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,319
plant, you can put the remaining part of

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,199
the aloe vera leaf into a blender. Add

94
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,199
about 0.3 L of water and blend it until

95
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,400
smooth. If you haven't subscribed yet,

[Applause]

102
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,000
Uh after blending, you should strain out

103
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,919
the pulp as the residue in the aloe vera

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,120
gel can clog the root system or make it

105
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,919
difficult for the plant to absorb

106
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,919
nutrients from the water.

107
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,880
Straining the pulp will make the

108
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,280
solution smooth, easy to absorb, and

109
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,800
safe for the plant. This also helps

110
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,120
prevent leaves and roots from getting

111
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,440
clogged with insoluble substances,

112
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,720
allowing the orchid to recover more

113
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,639
effectively. After straining the pulp,

114
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,360
you can dilute the aloe vera solution

115
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,280
with one liter of water. Diluting it

116
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,759
makes the solution gentler, ensuring it

117
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,759
doesn't harm the orchid.

118
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,120
After diluting the aloe vera solution,

119
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:55,319
soak the orchid's roots in this mixture

120
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,319
for about 15 to 20 minutes.

121
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,280
Soaking the roots helps the plant absorb

122
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,120
nutrients from the aloe vera while also

123
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,680
enhancing its ability to recover and

124
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,680
develop new

125
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:15,199
roots. Note that you shouldn't soak the

126
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,199
roots for too long as it could harm

127
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,199
them.

128
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,680
After soaking the roots, you can use a

129
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,159
soft cloth to soak up the aloe vera

130
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,399
solution and gently wipe both the top

131
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:44,440
and bottom of the orchid's leaves,

132
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,440
especially the wilted ones.

133
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,000
Uh this helps provide nutrients to the

134
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,839
leaves while also cleaning the leaf

135
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,839
surface, making it easier for the plant

136
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,920
to absorb the nutrients from the aloe

137
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,080
vera

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,279
the leaves while also cleaning the leaf

141
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,120
surface, allowing the plant to easily

142
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,250
absorb the nutrients from the aloe vera

143
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:15,869
gel.

[Music]

145
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,959
After wiping the leaves, take the

146
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,839
remaining aloe vera solution and put

147
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,839
into a spray bottle. Gently spray it on

148
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,360
the other orchids in your garden. It

149
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,360
will be very beneficial for them as

150
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:36,240
well. This misting will help provide

151
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,160
consistent moisture to the plant while

152
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,480
delivering aloe vera nutrients to every

153
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,480
part of the orchid.

154
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,440
Spray a light mist avoiding overwetting

155
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,760
to prevent the plant from rotting or

156
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,519
becoming water logged. This is a great

157
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,519
way to help the orchid recover and grow

158
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,519
healthily.

159
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,649

163
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,000
continue watering the orchid's roots

164
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,000
with the aloe vera

165
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,800
solution. Gently water around the base

166
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,800
and roots of the plant, ensuring that

167
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,360
the mixture is evenly absorbed into the

168
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,360
roots.

169
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,880
This helps provide additional nutrients

170
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,440
to the roots and stimulates the healthy

171
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,440
growth of the plant.

[Music]

173
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,720
You should also apply this once a week

174
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,480
and avoid overwatering to prevent the

175
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,160
plant from becoming water logged,

176
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,560
especially if the orchid hasn't fully

177
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,560
recovered yet.

[Music]

179
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,760
After watering, you should use a soft

180
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,079
cloth to gently blot off any water

181
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,720

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,680
reduces the growth of mold, especially

186
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,839
in damp areas like the spaces between

187
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,839
the leaves.

188
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,519
Gently blotting the water helps prevent

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,959
excess moisture, ensuring the orchid's

190
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,959
leaves dry and stay more

191
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,760
ventilated. By following these steps for

192
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:58,920
your orchid, you'll notice the leaves

193
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,920
will stay vibrant, strong, and healthy.

194
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,560
The plant will grow better, absorb light

195
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,519
more easily, and provide energy for

196
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,120
photosynthesis. This is a great way to

197
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,839
care for your orchid, helping it stay

198
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,839
fresh and

199
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:17,279
strong. After soaking the wilted orchid

200
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,079
roots in the aloe vera solution for

201
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:23,120
about 20 minutes, I proceed to plant the

202
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,120
orchid in a new

203
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:28,160
pot. After soaking the wilted orchid

204
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,880
roots in the aloe vera solution for

205
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,920
about 20 minutes, I proceed to plant the

206
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,920
orchid in a new

207
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:42,079
pot. When planting, carefully place the

208
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,839
orchid in the center of the pot,

209
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,720
adjusting the roots so that they are

210
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,399
comfortable and not bent. Then, gently

211
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:53,079
cover the roots with the growing medium

212
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,079
to keep the plant stable in the pot.

213
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,360
After planting the orchid, I take some

214
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,000
moss and spread it evenly around the rim

215
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,600
of the

216
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,519
pot. The moss will help retain moisture

217
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,120
for the plant while creating a natural

218
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,600
layer that keeps the growing medium

219
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,600
stable.

220
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,200
Additionally, the moss helps minimize

221
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,760
rapid water evaporation, maintaining

222
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,920
moisture for the plant and creating a

223
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,480
cool environment that aids in faster

224
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,760
recovery and better

225
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,200
growth. After planting the orchid, you

226
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,680
should place it in a well ventilated

227
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,120
area and avoid watering for 1 day,

228
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,120
allowing the cut to dry and heal

229
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,120
quickly.

230
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,440
Next, you can take one tablespoon of

231
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,440
rice to make fertilizer for the weak

232
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,040
orchid. Rice contains many nutrients

233
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,040
such as starch and vitamins, which help

234
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,839
provide energy to the plant, especially

235
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,839
during the recovery phase.

236
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,639
Uh place the rice in one liter of room

237
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,720
temperature water and soak it for 1 day

238
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,120
to allow the nutrients to dissolve into

239
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,600
the water. Then use this solution to

240
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,600
water the orchid.

241
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:36,160
[Music]

242
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,320
Uh the the natural fertilizer from rice

243
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,079
helps the plant develop strong roots,

244
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:44,120
allowing the wilted orchid to recover

245
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,120
quickly and regain its vitality.

246
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,480
After soaking the rice for one day,

247
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,480
filter out the rice

248
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,600
water. Rice water contains many

249
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,920
beneficial nutrients for the plant, such

250
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,199
as vitamin B and minerals, which help

251
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,600
stimulate the growth of the orchid's

252
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,600
roots and leaves.

253
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,680
After filtering, I use this rice water

254
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,600
to gently water around the base of the

255
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,839
plant, helping the orchid recover and

256
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,839
grow

257
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:41,920
better. However, make sure the orchid

258
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,440
pot has drainage holes to prevent water

259
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,440
logging, which can lead to root rot.

260
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,000
You only need to water the orchid with

261
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,000
rice water once a

262
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:03,199
week. Then take this mixture and put it

263
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,920
into a spray bottle, gently spraying it

264
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,920
on the wilted

265
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,480
orchid. Spraying mist helps provide

266
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,639
nutrients to the leaves and stimulates

267
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,399
the plant's recovery. Specifically,

268
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,240
spraying on the leaves helps retain

269
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,680
moisture and nourish the

270
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,279
plant. Uh, make sure to spray a light

271
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,320
layer and avoid overspraying to prevent

272
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,320
the plant from becoming too

273
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:31,839
wet. Applying this method once a week

274
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,839
will help the orchid recover and grow

275
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,839
stronger.

276
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,000
After spraying the rice water on the

277
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,759
orchid, you should gently blot the

278
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,959
excess water on the leaves and in

279
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,399
between the leaf joints with a soft

280
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:49,959
cloth. This helps prevent water from

281
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:52,720
accumulating, which could lead to rot or

282
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:55,120
mold. This helps prevent leaf rot and

283
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,680
mold, especially in damp areas like the

284
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,320
leaf joints. Gently blotting the water

285
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,399
allows the leaves to dry off, ensuring

286
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,919
good air flow while preventing excess

287
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,280
moisture that could harm the

288
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:08,959
plant. After completing all the care

289
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,839
steps, you should you should place the

290
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,679
orchid pot in a location with gentle

291
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:16,880
sunlight, avoiding direct harsh sunlight

292
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,880
as it can cause the leaves to

293
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,199
burn. Now, let's take a look at the

294
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,640
results after 10 days of recovery and

295
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,319
see how it turned out.

296
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,240
As you can see, the orchid has started

297
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,360
to

298
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,039
bloom. The fact that the flowers are

299
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,200
blooming again is a clear sign that the

300
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:39,600
plant has received enough nutrients and

301
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,600
is is in the right environment to

302
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,280
thrive. As you can see, the leaves of

303
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,320
the orchid have become lush again, and

304
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,000
there are no more signs of wilting as

305
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,919
before. This is clear evidence that the

306
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,030
plant has recovered very well after the

307
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:58,160
care process.

308
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,160
[Music]

309
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,840
When the leaves are fresh and strong

310
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,679
again, it not only helps the plant

311
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,880
absorb light effectively, but also

312
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,880
protects it from harmful

313
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,039
elements. With the recovery method,

314
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,360
using natural fertilizers from aloe vera

315
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,360
and rice, my orchid will surely grow

316
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,840
strong and continue to bloom in the

317
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,840
upcoming period.

318
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,000
And this is also a wilted orchid I had

319
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,480
revived earlier. Now after 3 months, it

320
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,480
has fully

321
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,440
recovered. After blooming, it is now

322
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,170
continuing to produce many new flower

323
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,289
