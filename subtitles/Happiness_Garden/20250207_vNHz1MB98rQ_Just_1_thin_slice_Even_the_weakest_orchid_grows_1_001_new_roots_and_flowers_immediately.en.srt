2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:07,600
channel when growing orchids everyone 
wishes for healthy plants and vibrant  

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,960
blooms to help you take care of 
your orchids at home in the best  

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,160
way today I will share a natural fertilizer 
recipe using familiar ingredients from your

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,840
kitchen this is a simple yet highly effective  

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:29,960
method that helps orchids grow strong 
and Bloom beautifully let's get started

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,200
do you have

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:44,960
rice I took 500 G of rice and washed it

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:55,200
clean uh rice contains many natural vitamins 
and minerals such as phosphorus pottassium  

10
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,920
and protein providing abundant nutrients 
to help orchids grow strong and healthy

11
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,680
therefore I regularly use rice as fertilizer 
for all types of orchids as well as other

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,760
plants add 1 liter of

13
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:27,520
water please comment to me which 
country you are watching the video  

14
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,600
from it's great it's great that we 
can chat together from all over the

15
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:39,000
world stir well so that the 
nutrients dissolve into the

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:48,880
water in addition to the English dub we've now 
created dubs in French German Italian Spanish  

17
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:59,840
Portuguese Japanese H Indonesian to help you 
hear and understand the content more easily

18
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:29,840
then filter this water

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,680
next I need one

20
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:59,840
tomato and cut into thin slices

21
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,280
Tomatoes contain many micronutrients and 
nutrients such as potassium phosphorus  

22
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:29,760
and vitamins which help promote plant growth

23
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,800
put tomatoes in the

24
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:59,720
jar then pour in the rice 
water to soak with the tomatoes

25
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,280
cover tightly and leave in 
a cool place for one day to

26
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:29,720
ferment one day later

27
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:59,640
filter out residue

28
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:29,640
then take 200 M of this liquid fertilizer solution

29
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,200
and mix with 2 lers of

30
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:46,360
water method

31
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:59,640
one water the Orchid with this 
liquid fertilizer at the base

32
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,960
rice water contains amino acids and 
beneficial microorganisms which help  

33
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:29,560
strengthen the soil microbiome 
thereby stimulating root growth

34
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,560
fertilizer from fermented Tomatoes also improves  

35
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:59,520
soil irration and moisture retention 
helping plants absorb water and nutrients

36
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,280
beneficial bacteria in the fermentation process 
help orchids increase their resistance to

37
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:19,560
diseases abundant nutrients and a Fresh Living 
environment help orchids blue more bigger and more

38
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:30,520
beautifully after watering soaking in 
this water for about 20 20 minutes is

39
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:48,160
best method

40
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:59,440
two use soft cotton to absorb this water and 
thoroughly wipe the top and bottom of the leaves

41
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,600
wiping leaves helps remove 
dirt and impurities helps  

42
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,240
plants photosynthesize better and 
increases their ability to absorb

43
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:31,520
light beneficial bacteria in 
the solution help strengthen  

44
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,080
plant resistance reducing the risk of pests and

45
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:52,920
diseases this solution creates light 
moisture on the leaf surface helping  

46
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:59,440
plants maintain moisture and prevent wilting

47
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,520
in addition when wiping the leaves the organic  

48
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:29,360
substances in the solution will 
be absorbed through the leaves

49
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,560
stimulates the growth of leaves 
roots and flowers helping plants grow

50
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:54,240
healthier method

51
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:01,560
three if you have many Orchid 
pots put this water in a spray

52
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:15,920
bottle then spray all over the

53
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:29,320
Orchid this method is like 
fertilizing plants through the leaves

54
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,480
spray both the top and bottom of the

55
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:59,240
leaves and spray on Orchid roots

56
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,640
however you should not spray it on

57
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:29,240
flowers because when flowers get 
wet the petals will quickly fall off

58
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,360
after soaking for about 20 minutes 
take the Orchid pot out and place  

59
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,840
it in a place with lots of scattered 
light so the Orchid can photosynthesize

60
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:59,240
well do all three methods above one 
to two times a month for your orchids

61
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,560
remaining liquid fertilizer solution you freeze  

62
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,680
and store for next use this 
method can be frozen for 3

63
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:42,760
months results after 3

64
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:59,120
weeks new Roots grow many and healthy

65
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,120
uh new Roots help the plant 
absorb water and nutrients  

66
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,960
from the environment ensuring survival and

67
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:29,120
growth new Roots help improve 
metabolism promoting flower formation

68
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,280
the growth of new Roots is often accompanied 
by the growth of other parts such as leaves and

69
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:55,160
flowers take care of your Orchids with 
all the love you have for plants and you
