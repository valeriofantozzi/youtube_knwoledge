00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,840
make natural fertilizer that is both

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,910

00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,719
blooming if not properly cared for the

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,760
plant can become stunted and grow slowly

15
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:47,719
so postflowering care is very important

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,510
to help the plant recover and prepare

17
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:55,650

22
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:16,280

focus its energy on healthy parts for

24
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,479

25
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:30,440
the plant to grow new roots and prepares

26
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:37,760

28
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:43,340

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,239
the ability to grow and can cause the

37
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,239
plant to waste energy if left

38
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,640

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:57,560

00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,040
cover the lid and let it sit overnight

breadcrumbs which are rich in nutrients

57
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,280
mix one liter of warm water with 2

the cinnamon water and gently wipe the

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,440
top and bottom surfaces of the

76

00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,919
this method also cleans the leaves

91
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:02,599
plant's natural resistance helping it

92
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,599

94
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:23,720
wipe off any excess water from the

95
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,720

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,880
wiping off water helps the leaves dry

quickly improving the plant's ability to

99
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,039
photosynthesize and

100
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,399
exchange reduces the risk of the Orchid

101
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,399
getting sick due to prolonged damp

00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,120
uh step four add a thin layer of moss on

105
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,360
the surface of the Orchid pot to to

106
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,270
retain moisture and create a better

107
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:16,840

00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,120
maintain moisture balance and prevents

111
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,720
the plant from losing water too quickly

112
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,720
