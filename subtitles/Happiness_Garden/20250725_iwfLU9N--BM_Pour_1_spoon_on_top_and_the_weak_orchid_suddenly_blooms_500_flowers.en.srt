Welcome to Happiness Garden, where the

00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:08,320
simplest things become magical moments

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,559

00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,480
Today, I'm sharing another simple yet

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,040
highly effective way to grow and care

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,039

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,199
natural fertilizer at home, even weak

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,680
orchids can recover, grow well, and

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,680
bloom beautifully.

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,039
When growing orchids at home, everyone

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,280
hopes their orchid spikes will produce

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,280
lots of buds and bloom with vibrant,

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,160
healthy flowers, just like the orchids I

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,160
take care of every day.

together from all around the world.

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,199
When orchids begin to bloom, each flower

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,680
stays on the spike for a long time

21
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:08,280
before fading, as if trying to prolong

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,280
its gentle and pure beauty over time.

23
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,159
And right now, I'll guide you through

24
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,520
the steps in a simple and detailed way

25
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,799
so you can start applying it to your

26
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,799
beloved orchid pots right away.

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,159
Each month, you only need to water each

28
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,560
orchid pot one to two times, just like

29
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,310
the way I always do. Simple, yet

30
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:38,499
surprisingly effective.

[Music]

32
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,880
Regular watering helps orchids maintain

33
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,360
the necessary moisture, allowing them to

34
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,799
absorb nutrients more effectively. When

35
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,119
provided with enough moisture, the

36
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,759
flowers will bloom fully and stay on the

37
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,880

[Music]

40
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,079
you can keep the orchid in its pot and

41
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,640
soak it in water for about 10 to 20

42
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,720
minutes. This method allows the roots to

43
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:15,160
absorb enough moisture without causing

44
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,160
the plant to become water logged.

45
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,879
After that, don't forget to take the

46
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,560
orchid pot out and let it drain,

47
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,080
allowing the roots to breathe and

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,840
preventing rot.

To start making natural fertilizer for

55
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,590
orchids, you only need one very familiar

56
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:54,000
ingredient from the kitchen. Garlic.

Take two cloves of garlic and slice them

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,560
very thinly so the nutrients can easily

60
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,560

clean bottle to prepare the watering

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,599
solution for your orchids.

65
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,519
Next, pour about one liter of room

66
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,280

67
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,310

70
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,879
The next ingredient is honey. a natural

71
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,319
component rich in nutrients that help

72
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,640
stimulate root growth and boost the

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,360
is completely dissolved in the water.

harmful fungi in the orchid growing

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,479
After finishing, you just need to wait

86
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,120
about 1 hour for the nutrients from the

87
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,759
garlic and honey to fully infuse into

88
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,380

If you have a weak orchid that hasn't

92
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,639
been able to bloom, start by checking

93
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,199
its roots. Remove any damaged roots and

94
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,360
leaves. Then replant the orchid in a

95
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,520
clean growing medium. This is the first

96
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,320
step to help it recover and prepare for

97
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,399

ago. As you can see, it has started to

191
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:51,240
grow many new roots. A very positive

192
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,240
sign of recovery.

193
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,600
When the root system becomes healthy

194
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,760
again, the plant will start to absorb

195
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,160
water and nutrients more effectively,

196
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,600
and gradually the once wilted leaves

197
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,680
will come back to life.

198
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,000
When the roots absorb enough water and

199
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,560
nutrients, the orchid can sustain its

200
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,959
flowers more effectively. As a result,

201
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,959
the petals on the spike stay fresh,

202
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:18,680
vibrant, and retain their beauty for a

203
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,680
long time before fading.

204
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,200
After soaking for about 10 to 20

205
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,120
minutes, once the roots have absorbed

206
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,880
enough nutrients, take the orchid pot

207
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,120
out and place it in a spot with gentle

208
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,360
sunlight. Uh this helps the plant

209
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,160
photosynthesize better, recover quickly

210
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,000
and grow healthily.

211
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,079
When provided with good fertilizer and

212
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,240
enough light for photosynthesis, the

213
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,640
orchid will grow healthily and its

214
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:47,910
leaves will always be lush green and

215
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:51,839
