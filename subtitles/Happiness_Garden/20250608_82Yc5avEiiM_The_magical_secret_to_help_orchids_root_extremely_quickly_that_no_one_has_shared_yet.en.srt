00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,800
nutrients.

[Music]

195
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,360
Then remove and repeat this treatment

196
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,360
every 14 days.

198
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,160
You can also freeze rice water to water

199
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,160
your orchids.

[Music]

201
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,160
When needed, you just need to take a few

202
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,160
cubes.

203
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:14,799
[Music]

204
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,880
Wait for them to defrost and reach room

205
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,970
temperature. You can feed your orchids

206
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:39,039
again.

00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:40,799
[Music]

208
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,320
Never place frozen blocks directly on

209
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,890
the base of the orchid because orchids

210
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:57,069
don't like the cold.

211
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:57,069
[Music]

212
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,679
After only 2 to 3 weeks of use, the

213
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,679
leaves will be green.

[Music]

216
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:19,120
Um, you can see that after fertilizing

217
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,799
the new roots grow very strongly. This

218
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,170
will help the orchid best absorb

219
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:30,849
nutrients through its roots.

226
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,600
With enough nutrition, your orchid will

227
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:53,880
flower all year round.

229
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,860

230
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:16,679
for you for this video.
