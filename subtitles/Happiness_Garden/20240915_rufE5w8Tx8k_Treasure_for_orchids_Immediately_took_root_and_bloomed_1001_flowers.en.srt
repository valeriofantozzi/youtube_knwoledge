Hello friends

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:08,899
Nice to meet you on my channel

3
00:00:08,899 --> 00:00:15,897
For orchids to grow healthily, they need a strong root system,

4
00:00:16,897 --> 00:00:22,896
Thanks to that, the orchid will grow sustainably and bloom many flowers

5
00:00:25,895 --> 00:00:32,894
Big, beautiful, bright flowers.

6
00:00:35,893 --> 00:00:42,892
When blooming, the flowers can stay on the branches for up to 6 months before fading

7
00:00:50,304 --> 00:00:58,303
Leaves that absorb enough fertilizer and light will always be green

8
00:00:58,435 --> 00:01:04,888
Leaves are sturdy and disease-free

9
00:01:04,888 --> 00:01:10,886
In this video, I share a new type of organic fertilizer with ingredients available in every kitchen.

10
00:01:10,886 --> 00:01:15,885
What I need is an apple.

11
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:30,882
I cut this apple into small slices.

12
00:01:33,882 --> 00:01:41,880
Natural fertilizers should not be underestimated; they are just as effective as ready-made mineral complexes but are safer.

13
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:55,878
You can see many types of homemade natural fertilizers on my channel

15
00:02:18,626 --> 00:02:25,872
This method of making fertilizer is very simple and anyone can do it.

16
00:03:09,896 --> 00:03:15,895
Put it in the jar

17
00:03:23,893 --> 00:03:29,892
I poured boiling water over the sliced ​​apples.

18
00:03:31,892 --> 00:03:36,891
Then cover tightly and set aside

19
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,889
I use oatmeal as fertilizer

20
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:55,887
Take 2 tablespoons of oatmeal and put it in a jar

21
00:03:58,887 --> 00:04:05,885
and add 500ml of room temperature water

22
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:26,881
Incubate until the water cools

23
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,879
1 Hour later

24
00:05:04,873 --> 00:05:10,872
Filter residue

25
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:28,869

26
00:05:48,898 --> 00:05:55,897
Filter and mix apple juice with oatmeal

27
00:05:57,896 --> 00:06:03,895
Add 1 liter of water

28
00:06:12,893 --> 00:06:15,893
METHOD 1

29
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:28,890
Take a cotton ball and wipe the leaves with this water

00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:39,888
Wipe both the top and bottom of the leaves thoroughly 1-2 times a month

00:06:45,887 --> 00:06:51,886
Helps remove dirt and residue on leaves

32
00:06:55,885 --> 00:07:02,883
This method also kills fungal diseases and insects that reside on leaves and harm orchids.

33
00:07:27,878 --> 00:07:33,877
Carefully wipe the underside of the leaf as well

34
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:45,875
Because the underside of leaves is often wet, insects and fungal diseases often hide there.

35
00:07:49,874 --> 00:07:56,873
They just wait for an opportunity and when they encounter favorable conditions, they will cause diseases that destroy orchids.

36
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:16,869
This will help keep the leaf stomata open

37
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:28,900
and your orchid will photosynthesize the light better

38
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:36,898
Helps increase resistance for orchids

39
00:08:45,896 --> 00:08:48,896

45
00:09:38,886 --> 00:09:46,884

00:09:48,884 --> 00:09:53,883

52
00:10:30,892 --> 00:10:36,874

53
00:10:45,873 --> 00:10:48,872
METHOD 3

54
00:10:50,872 --> 00:10:55,871
You pour this fertilizer solution into a spray bottle

55
00:11:03,869 --> 00:11:08,868
Then water and mist the orchid leaves and roots.

56
00:11:11,867 --> 00:11:18,899
Apples are rich in carbohydrates, protein, calcium, phosphorus,

57
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:24,898
potassium, zinc, iron and many other trace elements.

58
00:11:24,898 --> 00:11:30,897

63
00:11:58,891 --> 00:12:04,890
In this season, orchids grow many new flower branches

64
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,889
Result

65
00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:18,887
After 2-3 times of applying this fertilizer, the orchid begins to grow new roots

66
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:36,884

67
00:12:36,884 --> 00:12:43,883
