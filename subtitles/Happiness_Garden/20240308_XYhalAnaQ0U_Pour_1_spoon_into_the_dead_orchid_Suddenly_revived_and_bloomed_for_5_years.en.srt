00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Nice to meet you on my channel

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,463
Orchid is a tropical plant with very strong vitality

3
00:00:08,463 --> 00:00:16,109
With an orchid like this, many people probably throw it away because they think it's dead

4
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:23,105
When you see this orchid, don't rush to throw it away

5
00:00:23,105 --> 00:00:31,615
Today I will show you how to revive orchids like this quickly

6
00:00:34,918 --> 00:00:51,000
First, cut off all damaged roots

7
00:00:55,813 --> 00:01:12,551
Remember to subscribe to the channel so you don't miss any videos

8
00:01:16,665 --> 00:01:28,658
Rinse with water

9
00:01:35,657 --> 00:01:48,213
Dry the cut

10
00:01:57,071 --> 00:02:03,830
Drop the molten candle solution on the freshly cut wound

11
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:11,363
Will help orchids not lose water and also work against fungal diseases

12
00:02:32,548 --> 00:02:39,430
Use 1 teaspoon of cinnamon powder

13
00:02:41,656 --> 00:02:49,243
1 Liter of boiled water

14
00:02:53,225 --> 00:02:57,587
Close the lid and wait for the water to cool

15
00:03:04,106 --> 00:03:08,468
Now the water has cooled

16
00:03:12,571 --> 00:03:17,232
Filter out the residue

17
00:03:34,602 --> 00:03:39,000
Soak orchids in cinnamon water for 30 minutes

18
00:03:52,872 --> 00:03:59,881
Water the cinnamon evenly on the top and bottom of the leaves

19
00:03:59,881 --> 00:04:08,130
Cinnamon has antiseptic properties, so it helps to eliminate fungi and insects that are harmful to orchids very well

20
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:18,240
Cinnamon also contains many minerals, vitamins and amino acids that are very beneficial for the revival of orchids

21
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:26,085
Do this once a month to keep your orchid protected and healthy

22
00:04:28,003 --> 00:04:33,100
30 minutes after soaking in cinnamon water

23
00:04:40,768 --> 00:04:48,461
Use dry pine bark to grow orchids

24
00:04:58,435 --> 00:05:06,091
Spread 1 turn of dry moss on top of the pot

25
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:29,686
Leave in a cool place and do not water for 1 week so that the fungus does not grow harmful

26
00:05:37,636 --> 00:05:45,223
1 week later, start watering to keep the orchid moist

27
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:59,834
Pour water into the dish at the bottom of the pot to create the right humidity for the orchid to revive quickly

28
00:06:02,745 --> 00:06:12,723
Recycling plastic bottles into miniature greenhouses makes it easier for orchids to revive

29
00:06:18,815 --> 00:06:32,712
1 month later

30
00:06:52,592 --> 00:07:06,383
Since the tree has grown roots, I use organic fertilizer made from fish waste to fertilize the orchid

31
00:07:06,383 --> 00:07:20,965
The baby orchid is still very small, so I only apply it on the outside edge of the pot to avoid causing the baby orchid to be shocked with feces

32
00:07:24,042 --> 00:07:37,690
Watering and moisturizing once a week

33
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:56,722
2 months later

34
00:08:24,186 --> 00:08:29,067
From now on take care like other mature orchids

35
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:35,367
