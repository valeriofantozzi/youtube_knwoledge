00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,960
Welcome to the happiness garden where

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,080
every day we care for and admire the

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,559
orchids blooming in vibrant colors.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,040
Here every leaf and every root tells a

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:16,040
story of gentle care and love for the

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,040
plants.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,160
Today I will share with you how to care

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,119
for orchids with wilted and wrinkled

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,640
leaves by using natural fertilizer. When

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,119
applied correctly, the plant will

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,039
quickly regain vitality. The roots will

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,560
grow strong and the leaves will become

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,320
greener.

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,719
Gradually, the orchids will bloom

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,320
brilliantly, showing their colors and

16
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,320
bringing joy and excitement to your

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,320
garden.

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,879
First, gently cut off the dried and

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,280
wilted flower stems still attached to

20
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,600
the plant. This not only helps the plant

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,760
look tidier but also allows energy to

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,640
focus on the roots and leaves thereby

23
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,640
promoting healthy growth.

24
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,119
Next, we will carefully examine the

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,439
roots along with the surrounding medium.

26
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,159
This helps you identify which roots are

27
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,760
still healthy, which ones are damaged,

28
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,280
and whether the medium is sufficiently

29
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,280
airy or retaining too much water.

30
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,840
Through the inspection, I noticed that

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,000
the plant's roots are still healthy, but

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,079
slightly wrinkled, indicating that the

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,680
plant needs additional nutrients and

34
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,360
moisture.

35
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,920
The surrounding medium is still good and

36
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,920
airy, so we don't need to repot. We just

37
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,159
focus on caring for the roots to help

38
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,159
them recover.

39
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,200
[Music]

40
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,439
Since both the roots and leaves are

41
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,920
wrinkled, the next step we need to take

42
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:59,320
is to water and soak the roots before

43
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,320
applying fertilizer.

44
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,000
This helps the roots absorb enough

45
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,840
water, expand, and become more flexible,

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,920
creating optimal conditions for the

47
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,160
plant to take in nutrients from the

48
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,920
natural fertilizer.

49
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,239
When the roots are fully hydrated, the

50
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,000
leaves will gradually become plump again

51
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,560
and the orchid will be ready for the

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,560
recovery process.

53
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,239
When the roots and medium are

54
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,800
sufficiently moist, fertilizing becomes

55
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,640
much more effective. Nutrients from the

56
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,800
natural fertilizer will easily penetrate

57
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,280
the roots, helping the plant absorb the

58
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,599
essential elements to the fullest. As a

59
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,959
result, the roots will grow strong and

60
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,959
the leaves will gradually recover.

61
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,000
Soak the roots in water for about 20

62
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,680
minutes to ensure they are fully

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,640
hydrated.

64
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,879
This time allows the roots to expand,

65
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,760
become flexible, and be ready to absorb

66
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,599
nutrients from the fertilizer.

67
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,040
Uh while waiting for the roots to soak

68
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,200
for 20 minutes, we can take the

69
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:03,360
opportunity to prepare the natural

70
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,599
fertilizer to care for the orchids.

71
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,519
Aloe vera leaves contain natural gel

72
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,080
which is very good for restoring orchids

73
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,840
with wrinkled leaves. The gel in aloe

74
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,840
vera provides moisture and gentle

75
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,159
nutrients, helping the leaves become

76
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,080
plump again and reducing wilting.

77
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,800
Uh the next ingredient we will use is

78
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,360
rice. Rice is rich in starch and some

79
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,519
minerals and when made into natural

80
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,120
fertilizer, it provides energy and

81
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,720
essential nutrients for the orchid

82
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,720
roots.

83
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,799
Just three teaspoons of rice are enough

84
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,670
to prepare natural fertilizer for the

85
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,519
orchid.

[Music]

87
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,879
The final ingredient we will use is

88
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,920
vitamin B1. Just three tablets, each 2.5

89
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,000
mg. And vitamin B1 will stimulate strong

90
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,879
root growth and enhance the orchid's

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,879
ability to absorb nutrients.

93
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,639
Mix all the ingredients into one liter

94
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,040
of water. This will create a uniform

95
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,800
natural fertilizer solution that can

96
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,220
easily penetrate the roots and the

97
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:36,960
medium.

After dissolving the ingredients, cover

100
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,410
the container and let the solution rest

101
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:47,619
for about 2 hours.

After soaking the roots for about 20

104
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,880
minutes, gently take the orchid out and

105
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,800
let it drain before applying fertilizer.

106
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,400
Allowing it to drain prevents the roots

107
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,000
from being overly submerged when

108
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,960
receiving the fertilizer, ensuring

109
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,960
nutrients are absor absorbed evenly and

110
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,960
effectively.

rest for two hours, stir it well to

114
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,000
ensure the nutrients from the rice, aloe

115
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,240
vera gel, and vitamin B1 are evenly

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,440
dissolved, making sure every part of the

117
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,440
solution is rich in nutrients.

After stirring well, strain out the

120
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,600
remaining residue in the solution. This

121
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,759
makes the fertilizer smooth and easy to

122
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,960
penetrate the roots, preventing blockage

123
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,960
and keeping the medium airy.

124
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Gently squeeze the aloe vera leaves to

125
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,320
extract the gel and fully dissolve it

126
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,320
into the solution.

127
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,600
Then gently pour this mixture onto your

128
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,360
orchid pot.

129
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,280
Watering evenly over the roots and

130
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:00,199
medium helps the nutrients penetrate

131
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,199
deeply, stimulating strong root growth.

132
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,000
When you water this mixture onto a

leaves become plump again.

139
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,479
The rice in the solution provides starch

140
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,919
and minerals, stimulating strong root

141
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,350

new leaf growth and eventually the

149
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,720
fresh, vibrant flowers about to bloom.

150
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,160
After watering, you can let the orchid

151
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,720
pot soak in this mixture for about 20

152
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,479
minutes. Soaking helps the roots absorb

153
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,000
the maximum nutrients from the aloe

154
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,759
vera, rice, and vitamin B1 while also

155
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,400
increasing the necessary moisture for

156
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,400
the leaves and roots.

157
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,919
Next, use a soft cloth to dab this

158
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,080
mixture and gently wipe both the top and

159
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,840
underside of the leaves. This allows the

160
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,240
nutrients to penetrate directly into the

161
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:16,680
leaves, providing moisture and helping

162
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,680
restore wrinkled, wilted leaves.

163
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,800
When the leaves are carefully cared for,

164
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,400
they become plump and healthy,

165
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,800
contributing to the orchid's full

166
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,680
recovery and preparing it for the bright

167
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,680
flowers about to bloom.

168
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,399
You can pour the leftover mixture into a

169
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,640
spray bottle and use it to mist the

170
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,640
other orchids in your garden. This helps

make the most of the nutrients while

172
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:00,600
providing even moisture and nutrition to

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,600
all the plants.

174
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,800
When regularly cared for with this

175
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,959

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,040
For orchids that have not yet bloomed,

180
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,040
this fertilizer will help stimulate

181
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,040
strong root growth and healthier,

greener leaves.

183
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,880
When the roots are firm and the leaves

184
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,600
are healthy, the plant will store enough

185
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,399
energy to form buds. As a result, the

After soaking for about 20 minutes, take

197
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,640
the orchid pot out and place it in a

198
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,760
spot with gentle sunlight. The soft

199
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,160
light will help the plant

200
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:26,020
photosynthesize better, allowing the

201
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:29,220
leaves and roots to recover quickly.

208
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,800

212
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,959
the plant is gradually regaining its

213
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,279
vitality. With regular care, in just a

214
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:44,490
short time, these new leaves will grow

215
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:50,000
strong, lush green, and full of life.

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:58,160
natural fertilizer made from aloe vera,

219
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:00,320
rice, and vitamin B1. This combination

220
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,040
provides complete nutrients, helping the

221
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:06,050
roots grow strong and encouraging faster

222
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:15,040

wonderful to have you along.

228
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,720
Water your orchid with this mixture once

229
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,880
every 2 weeks. A regular watering

230
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,639

231
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,600
the leaves green, and the plant

232
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,600

leaves. stems, roots, and even the

238
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,480
medium. This method allows the nutrients

239
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,880
to be absorbed directly by each part of

240
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,279
the plant, providing both moisture and

241
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,279
complete nourishment.

242
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,480
When done regularly, the orchid will

243
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,240
recover faster, grow more lush green

244
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,490
