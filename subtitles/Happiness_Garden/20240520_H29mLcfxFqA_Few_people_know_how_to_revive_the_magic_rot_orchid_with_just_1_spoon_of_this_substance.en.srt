00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,999
You can see that this orchid is heavily attacked by fungi and bacteria.

3
00:00:09,999 --> 00:00:15,093
It makes orchid leaves yellow and black rot.

4
00:00:15,093 --> 00:00:18,843
If not handled promptly, this orchid can die very quickly.

5
00:00:18,843 --> 00:00:24,696
First, remove all diseased leaves,

6
00:00:24,696 --> 00:00:30,753
Otherwise, it will spread to the whole tree,

7
00:00:30,753 --> 00:00:37,381
It even spreads to other healthy plants.

8
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:10,764
Cut off even damaged roots.

9
00:01:19,822 --> 00:01:23,345
Since the orchid has no leaves, I have to cut off the flower bud,

10
00:01:23,345 --> 00:01:29,302
Prioritize nutrients for small orchids to revive.

11
00:01:30,704 --> 00:01:33,770
This is white cement.

12
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:37,756
Use 1 small spoon,

13
00:01:37,756 --> 00:01:45,210
Add 0.5 liters of water

14
00:01:49,557 --> 00:01:51,557
Wait 30 minutes.

15
00:01:56,339 --> 00:02:00,400
AFTER 30 MINUTES OF WAIT.

16
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:07,838
Decant to see the clear water above.

17
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:13,930
Remove turbid water underneath.

18
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:33,004
Soak the whole orchid in this water for about 30 minutes.

19
00:02:38,837 --> 00:02:44,893
AFTER WAITING FOR 30 MINUTES BILLION.

20
00:02:44,893 --> 00:02:50,199
Hang in a cool place for 1 day.

21
00:02:54,877 --> 00:03:01,981
After hanging for 1 day.

22
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:08,772
This is cinnamon powder.

23
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:27,302
I put cinnamon powder on all the cuts to disinfect.

24
00:03:44,687 --> 00:04:02,835
Growing orchids with dry pine bark.

25
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:23,329
Leave in a cool place for 1 week without watering.

26
00:04:28,605 --> 00:04:32,376
After 1 week without watering.

27
00:04:32,376 --> 00:04:38,464
The cut is dry.

28
00:04:42,821 --> 00:04:46,801
Use 1 liter of water.

29
00:04:52,607 --> 00:05:10,406
Add 20 grams of aloe leaves.

30
00:05:57,854 --> 00:06:12,557
Watering freshly made aloe vera for orchids.

31
00:06:12,557 --> 00:07:03,875
Aloe vera juice contains many essential minerals and vitamins that help stimulate root growth,

32
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:24,763
It also stimulates germination.

33
00:07:24,763 --> 00:07:35,036
Leave in a cool place and wait.

34
00:07:39,406 --> 00:07:53,218
AFTER 3 WEEKS.

35
00:07:53,218 --> 00:08:09,763
new sprouts.

36
00:08:38,881 --> 00:08:59,490
From now on, water once every 5-7 days to keep moisture.

37
00:09:06,002 --> 00:09:16,805
AFTER THE NEXT 2 MONTHS.

38
00:09:16,805 --> 00:09:46,970
Orchid has revived and grown healthy.

39
00:09:46,970 --> 00:10:00,308
From every 2 weeks, you fertilize organically as I have shared so that the orchid grows and flowers a lot
