00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,033
Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:07,032 --> 00:00:14,327
Today I will show you how to revive a rotten orchid like this.

3
00:00:17,196 --> 00:00:32,487
When the orchid has withered all the leaves and only the stem and roots, do not rush to throw it away.

4
00:00:55,518 --> 00:01:01,505
Here the branches are still fresh

5
00:01:17,858 --> 00:01:26,810
I will remove all wilted and rotten leaves

6
00:01:41,531 --> 00:01:51,097
and I remove all the broken roots

7
00:02:13,857 --> 00:02:18,924
I keep only the fresh roots that are left over

8
00:02:19,692 --> 00:02:27,876
I cut off the flower stalk so that the orchid can concentrate nutrients for the new sprout to grow

9
00:02:30,803 --> 00:02:37,915
rinse with water

10
00:02:51,971 --> 00:03:00,000
Apply melted candle solution to the cut to prevent water from seeping into the tree.

11
00:03:13,495 --> 00:03:21,334
Use 3 cloves of garlic and mince

12
00:03:28,273 --> 00:03:33,134
Soak garlic in 1 liter of water at room temperature

13
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:42,000
Incubate for 1 day

14
00:03:43,172 --> 00:03:48,648
At the same time, spread in a cool place for 1 day.

15
00:03:54,028 --> 00:03:56,846
1 DAY AFTER

16
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,934
filter out residue

17
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:23,173
Soak orchid branches in garlic water for 20 minutes

18
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:46,849
The rest of the water I will spray on other orchids to help protect the orchid from insects and fungi

19
00:04:46,849 --> 00:05:04,497
At the same time, garlic juice also stimulates the development of roots and flower sprouts very well

20
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:11,779
20 MINUTES AFTER

21
00:05:31,997 --> 00:05:36,441
After soaking for 30 minutes, plant.

22
00:05:36,858 --> 00:05:46,867
Using pine bark or dry pumice stone to plant will help absorb moisture in the roots, making the orchid roots not rot.

23
00:05:51,811 --> 00:05:56,614
Put in a cool place for 1 week without watering

24
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,310
1 WEEK LATER

25
00:06:13,185 --> 00:06:21,000
From now on, water the orchid to keep it moist

26
00:06:22,235 --> 00:06:33,286
Then put it in a place with a temperature of 20-25 degrees Celsius and avoid direct sunlight

27
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:39,500
Regularly spray moisture to spread life and revive faster

28
00:06:44,476 --> 00:06:47,464
2 WEEKS AFTER

29
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:29,604
Use 3ml of GE Ginger water mixed with 1 liter of water

30
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:49,572
GE ginger juice is considered an organic fertilizer that helps to stimulate plant growth very well

31
00:07:51,863 --> 00:07:56,771
Water this GE Ginger every 10 days

32
00:08:05,353 --> 00:08:09,474
 Continue to place in a cool place and avoid direct sunlight

33
00:08:09,474 --> 00:08:13,730
Cover with a clear, vented plastic container and wait for the plant to revive.

34
00:08:15,883 --> 00:08:18,422
1 MONTH LATER

35
00:08:18,422 --> 00:08:30,000
The roots have grown very well, so we fertilize the orchid with organic fertilizer as I have shared to make the orchid grow healthier

36
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,131
Hope this sharing content will help you in resurrecting weak orchids to grow again

The video I have created many subtitles, you can choose the appropriate language to understand my sharing.

39
00:09:19,345 --> 00:09:23,889
welcome to my channel,

40
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:28,888
Today I share with you an amazing organic fertilizer,

41
00:09:28,888 --> 00:09:30,888
And anyone can do it easily.

42
00:09:30,888 --> 00:09:32,888
Just 1 to 2 ripe bananas,

43
00:09:32,888 --> 00:09:39,886
And the orchid garden will bloom all kinds of flowers.

44
00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:50,884
Now I will revive this orchid with new flowers,

45
00:09:50,884 --> 00:09:56,882
You've seen this orchid lose all its flowers, leaving only withered branches

46
00:10:00,882 --> 00:10:16,878
And here are the withered orchids that have been revived with lots of new flowers.

47
00:10:16,878 --> 00:10:20,771
STEP

48
00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:48,872
cut off the withers

49
00:10:49,872 --> 00:11:13,867
Apply toothpaste on the cut

50
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:37,896
This will disinfect and help prevent rot

51
00:11:40,895 --> 00:11:59,891
Don't throw away banana peels when eating bananas

52
00:12:01,891 --> 00:12:17,888
Use 1 to 2 ripe banana peels

53
00:12:26,886 --> 00:12:36,884
Clip the banana peel to the place where the flower buds can grow

54
00:12:36,884 --> 00:12:45,882
and note to remove after 6 hours

55
00:12:45,882 --> 00:13:02,879
This helps to create the right moisture, provide essential nutrients and stimulate flower sprouts,

56
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:09,878
do this once a week

57
00:13:09,878 --> 00:13:12,877
STEP 2

58
00:13:12,877 --> 00:13:22,875
Use a banana peel to wipe the top and bottom of the leaves,

59
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:29,874
Helps eliminate insects, fungi, bacteria hiding on orchid leaves,

60
00:13:29,874 --> 00:13:39,872
and at the same time provide a part of nutrients through the leaves for orchids

61
00:13:39,872 --> 00:13:53,869
Orchids will be protected and will not be affected by yellowing and rotten leaves.

62
00:13:53,869 --> 00:14:07,899
After wiping, you will see green leaves,

63
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:15,898
Orchids will photosynthesize better to increase resistance.

64
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:19,897
 STEP 3

65
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:31,895
1 liter of water

66
00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:05,888
Leave in a cool and dark place for 1 day

67
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:16,886
AFTER 1 DAY

68
00:15:20,885 --> 00:15:26,884
banana juice is darker

69
00:15:56,878 --> 00:16:03,876
Use this absorbent cotton

70
00:16:04,876 --> 00:16:11,875
 Clip a cotton ball where the flower buds can grow

71
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:17,874
and note to remove after 6 hours

72
00:16:17,874 --> 00:16:25,872
This helps to create the right moisture, provide essential nutrients and stimulate flower sprouts,

73
00:16:25,872 --> 00:16:29,871
do this once a week

74
00:16:29,871 --> 00:16:34,870
STEP 4

75
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:40,869
Normally after 3-4 weeks flower buds will be formed and develop like this,

76
00:16:41,869 --> 00:17:02,898
With a flower sprout this big, there's no need to sandwich banana peels with cotton balls

77
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:43,890
You will be surprised how amazing this is

78
00:17:49,889 --> 00:18:04,886
Don't forget to subscribe to see my next videos

79
00:18:08,885 --> 00:18:11,884
STEP 5

80
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:14,884
Add water to make 2 liters

81
00:18:16,883 --> 00:18:18,883
Water this banana for orchids once every 2-3 weeks

82
00:18:18,883 --> 00:18:22,882
Banana peel is rich in potassium, phosphorus and essential vitamins

83
00:18:24,882 --> 00:18:28,881
will promote the growth of orchid roots

84
00:18:28,881 --> 00:18:37,879
In particular, the potassium in banana peels stimulates flowering very well.

85
00:18:38,879 --> 00:18:48,877
In addition, you need to combine using other organic fertilizers for orchids,

86
00:18:50,877 --> 00:19:00,875
like manure made from soybeans, peas, fish poop... as I shared,

87
00:19:03,874 --> 00:19:10,873
Hope this sharing content will help you in taking better care of orchids at home

88
00:19:10,873 --> 00:19:19,871
then make sure the orchid will grow healthy and produce many flowers.

89
00:19:20,871 --> 00:19:23,870
welcome to my channel.

90
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:32,868
Today I share a new way to help spread more roots, branches and flower buds.

91
00:19:35,868 --> 00:19:44,899
Join me in discovering this wonderful way to make organic fertilizer.

92
00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:57,897
To make this type of fertilizer you need 1 branch of ginger.

93
00:20:37,889 --> 00:20:48,887
After slicing, put into a glass jar.

94
00:20:51,886 --> 00:21:00,884
Then add 1 spoon of yeast.

95
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:09,883
This is the yeast used to make bread.

96
00:21:12,882 --> 00:21:22,880
and add 1 teaspoon of honey.

97
00:21:30,878 --> 00:21:40,876
and 1 liter of warm water.

98
00:21:55,873 --> 00:22:05,871
Incubate in a dark place for 1 week.

99
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:16,869
1 WEEKLATER

100
00:22:27,867 --> 00:22:39,898
Take 3 tablespoons of fermented ginger solution.

101
00:22:49,896 --> 00:22:59,894
Add 1 liter of water.

102
00:23:02,894 --> 00:23:06,893
First Method

103
00:23:06,893 --> 00:23:13,891
Use cotton balls dipped in organic fertilizer solution from fermented ginger.

104
00:23:43,885 --> 00:23:53,883
Then place it in the places where you want to take root and sprout.

105
00:23:57,883 --> 00:24:07,881
After 6 hours, take the cotton out.

106
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:19,878
Do it once a week.

107
00:24:32,876 --> 00:24:36,875
Method 2

108
00:24:39,874 --> 00:24:49,872
If you want this branch to continue blooming.

109
00:24:54,871 --> 00:25:04,869
Then add cotton and clip it.

110
00:25:08,869 --> 00:25:18,900
After 6 hours, take the cotton out.

111
00:25:23,638 --> 00:25:30,631
Do it once a week.

112
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:39,896
Method 3

113
00:25:42,138 --> 00:25:52,127
If you want this button to continue growing flower buds.

114
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:13,123
Peel off the protective film of the sleeping sprouts.

115
00:26:18,122 --> 00:26:28,420
This helps the buds grow faster.

116
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:39,417
Apply toothpaste to the cut.

117
00:26:42,417 --> 00:26:52,415
This helps the cut heal quickly.

118
00:27:00,413 --> 00:27:10,411
Then stuff cotton into the button with this sleeping bud.

119
00:27:12,411 --> 00:27:20,409
After 6 hours, take the cotton out.

120
00:27:20,409 --> 00:27:24,433
Method 4

121
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:46,404
Use a fertilizer solution from fermented ginger after the leaves.

122
00:27:54,402 --> 00:28:04,401
Helps kill fungi and insects very well

123
00:28:10,433 --> 00:28:19,398
Cleaning the stomata helps orchids photosynthesize well.

124
00:28:26,396 --> 00:28:30,395
Method 5

125
00:28:33,395 --> 00:28:53,391
Apply this liquid fertilizer to the base of the orchid.

126
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:08,388
This type of fertilizer helps stimulate the growth of roots, branches and buds very well.

127
00:29:12,387 --> 00:29:15,386
Method 6

128
00:29:17,386 --> 00:29:27,384
Spray the fertilizer solution from fermented ginger on the entire orchid.

129
00:29:35,383 --> 00:29:45,381
Supports nutritional supplementation through leaves very well.

130
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:51,379
RESULT

131
00:29:53,379 --> 00:30:03,377
After 2 months, the sprouts and roots developed very well.

132
00:30:06,376 --> 00:30:18,374
The flower buds have also developed and are ready to bloom.

133
00:30:28,372 --> 00:30:36,370
The buds at the tips of the branches continue to grow and bloom.

134
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:48,368
Sprouts also grow in leaf axils.

135
00:31:05,398 --> 00:31:13,396
Many branches grow on the same tree.

136
00:31:15,396 --> 00:31:25,394
The flowers bloom on the branches for up to 6 months before falling.

137
00:31:30,282 --> 00:31:35,276
The roots are likened to the soul of the orchid

138
00:31:35,276 --> 00:31:40,472
Orchids grow healthy thanks to healthy roots

139
00:31:40,472 --> 00:31:46,423
If the roots are healthy, the orchid will also grow many flower buds

140
00:31:46,423 --> 00:31:54,421
In this video I will show you how to make orchids grow roots and flower buds quickly

141
00:31:56,153 --> 00:32:05,119
You need 1 fresh ginger (about 50g)

142
00:32:05,695 --> 00:32:12,684
Cut ginger into small pieces

143
00:32:29,942 --> 00:32:35,913
put in a jar (recommended plastic jar)

144
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:42,912
add 3 tablespoons sugar (any sugar will do)

145
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:53,910
Add in 100ml of filtered water

146
00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:03,708
Add in 100ml of beer (any beer is fine)

147
00:33:22,704 --> 00:33:26,703
Cover and keep in a dark place for 1 month

148
00:33:26,703 --> 00:33:31,697
Open the lid once every 3 days to let the gas out

149
00:33:34,907 --> 00:33:40,934
1 MONTH LATER

150
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:50,965
The smell of GE ginger is fermented so it's very fragrant

151
00:33:53,483 --> 00:34:00,463
ratio of mixing 3ml GE ginger for 1 liter of water

152
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,957
FIRST WAY

153
00:34:33,541 --> 00:34:40,522
Soak cotton balls in water mixed with ginger GE

154
00:34:48,089 --> 00:34:56,085
Place cotton balls soaked in GE ginger between the leaves

155
00:34:58,318 --> 00:35:06,317
Helps keep moisture and GE ginger stimulates rooting and flower sprout differentiation very quickly

156
00:35:06,317 --> 00:35:10,249
Change this cotton once every 3 days

157
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:19,781
On normal days when the cotton is dry,

158
00:35:22,969 --> 00:35:28,945
you just need to mist it with water to keep it moist.

159
00:35:30,499 --> 00:35:33,478
WAY 2

160
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:46,109
Use this water to wash the top and bottom of the leaves,

161
00:35:46,109 --> 00:35:52,858
Helps provide nutrients through leaves,

162
00:35:52,858 --> 00:35:58,840
clean stomata,

163
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:03,272
Eliminate harmful insects and fungi,

164
00:36:03,272 --> 00:36:08,638
help orchid photosynthesis the best

165
00:36:09,637 --> 00:36:16,636
Wipe the orchid leaves with GE ginger once a month

166
00:36:17,636 --> 00:36:23,635
so that orchids are best protected and developed

167
00:36:33,347 --> 00:36:37,332
WAY 3

168
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:46,230
Use GE ginger water to water orchids

169
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:52,196
Yeast brewed from fresh ginger has the effect of stimulating sprouting,

170
00:36:52,196 --> 00:36:58,194
strong rooting, repelling insects, killing fungi, stimulating buds, and stimulating growth.

171
00:36:58,194 --> 00:37:03,193
GE ginger also helps orchids increase their ability to absorb nutrients from the fertilizer you fertilize them.

172
00:37:04,629 --> 00:37:07,626
Only do this 1-2 times a month

173
00:37:08,919 --> 00:37:14,891
Do not use too much will affect the growth of orchids

174
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:22,423
SEE THE RESULTS

175
00:37:23,548 --> 00:37:29,522
After 1 week of use, new roots grow very quickly

176
00:37:31,521 --> 00:37:37,520
These roots will help the orchid absorb nutrients more easily and more

177
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:45,518
Orchids grow well or not thanks to the photosynthesis of roots and leaves

178
00:38:21,511 --> 00:38:30,510
when the orchid is healthy, after the orchid branch blooms the last flowers,

179
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:39,508
Then there will be new flowers that will continue to grow.

180
00:39:07,869 --> 00:39:12,907
With this simple way you can do it yourself to take care of orchids at home,

181
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:18,400
at very low cost and convenience

182
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:24,667

To help you have many choices when caring for orchids at home with organic fertilizer.

186
00:39:44,895 --> 00:39:50,894

Subscribe to the video so you don't miss any tips on my channel.

188
00:39:58,892 --> 00:40:02,892
Now, let's get started.

189
00:40:05,891 --> 00:40:16,889
To make this type of organic fertilizer you need black tea (or tea grounds).

190
00:40:20,888 --> 00:40:29,886
I use 3 teaspoons of black tea.

191
00:40:31,886 --> 00:40:41,884
Add 1 liter of boiled water.

192
00:40:51,882 --> 00:41:01,880
Incubate until the water cools.

193
00:41:08,878 --> 00:41:38,873
After the water cools, filter to remove sediment.

194
00:41:48,871 --> 00:41:58,869
Add water to make 5 liters of black tea solution.

195
00:42:11,899 --> 00:42:26,896
Next add 1 teaspoon of baking soda.

196
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:45,893
FIRST METHOD

197
00:42:48,892 --> 00:42:58,890
Water this fertilizer solution on the orchid roots.

198
00:43:06,888 --> 00:43:16,886
Black tea contains many minerals and organic substances that help provide nutrition for orchids.

199
00:43:25,885 --> 00:43:35,883
It contains nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus,

200
00:43:36,883 --> 00:43:45,881
Important nutritional factors for orchid growth.

201
00:43:56,879 --> 00:44:06,877
Baking soda (bicarbonate soda) has the ability to increase the PH level in orchid pots,

202
00:44:10,876 --> 00:44:20,874
This is helpful in reducing acidity if you use too much chemical fertilizer.

203
00:44:29,872 --> 00:44:39,870
Baking soda has the ability to kill insects and fungi that are harmful to plants.

204
00:44:53,867 --> 00:44:56,900
SECOND METHOD

205
00:45:16,896 --> 00:45:26,894
Spray this fertilizer on the entire orchid.

206
00:45:36,892 --> 00:45:46,890
This method is similar to using foliar fertilizer.

207
00:45:53,889 --> 00:46:03,887
You can use it as a natural pesticide to protect orchids from insects and diseases.

208
00:46:31,881 --> 00:46:35,880
THIRD METHOD

209
00:46:42,879 --> 00:46:52,877
Clean the leaf surface with this fertilizer solution.

210
00:47:03,875 --> 00:47:15,872
The leaf surface will always be clean and the stomata will not be clogged.

211
00:47:25,871 --> 00:47:35,869
Orchids will photosynthesize better.

212
00:47:41,867 --> 00:47:44,900
RESULT

213
00:47:49,899 --> 00:48:03,896
Plant roots are protected and supplemented with nutrients so they grow very healthily.

214
00:48:08,895 --> 00:48:18,893
will help orchids absorb the most nutrients.

215
00:48:25,892 --> 00:48:35,890
Because they are provided with enough nutrition, the flowers bloom more brilliantly.

216
00:48:39,889 --> 00:48:49,887
Many flowers bloom on the same branch.

217
00:48:56,886 --> 00:49:07,884
The flowers stay on the branches for a long time before fading.

218
00:49:25,214 --> 00:49:29,879
