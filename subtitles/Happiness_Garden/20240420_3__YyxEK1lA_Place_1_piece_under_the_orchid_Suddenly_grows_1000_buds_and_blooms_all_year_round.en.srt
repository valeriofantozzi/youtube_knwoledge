Hello everyone, to easily care for orchids to always grow healthily.

2
00:00:06,999 --> 00:00:15,997
There are more flower buds and flowers stay on the branches longer.

3
00:00:15,997 --> 00:00:24,996
Today I share a very easy way to keep orchids growing healthily.

4
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:40,992
When eating bananas, don't throw away the peel.

5
00:00:40,992 --> 00:00:48,991
Because banana peels contain many nutrients, especially organic potassium.

6
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:56,989
Very good for the growth of buds, flowers and has anti-drought effects.

7
00:01:07,344 --> 00:01:15,319
I cut the banana peel thinly and put it in a jar.

8
00:01:15,591 --> 00:01:22,584
Next I took a piece of bread.

9
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:32,582
Bread contains phosphorus, which plays an important role in plant growth, especially stimulating root growth.

10
00:02:01,675 --> 00:02:10,641
And adding 2 tablespoons of sugar helps nourish the growth of beneficial microorganisms.

11
00:02:17,623 --> 00:02:25,605
Add 1 liter of warm water

12
00:02:37,363 --> 00:02:47,334
Then add 40 ml of wine, which helps ferment quickly and helps organic matter decompose quickly.

13
00:03:03,153 --> 00:03:08,130
Then leave in a cool place for 3 weeks.

14
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:15,941
3 Weeks later.

15
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:17,941
Take 3 liters of water.

16
00:03:26,243 --> 00:03:33,225
After 3 weeks of composting we have this wonderful fertilizer.

17
00:03:38,613 --> 00:03:45,589
Take 50ml.

18
00:03:48,734 --> 00:03:55,720
then mix into water.

19
00:03:57,358 --> 00:04:02,352
Method 1: Fertilize the roots.

20
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:12,784
Water each orchid pot with this water 5-10 spoons per week.

21
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:25,048
This fertilizer provides potassium, an important mineral that improves plant health and vitality.

22
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:43,744
This type of fertilizer also helps retain water and enhances the plant's ability to absorb water.

23
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:58,541
Beneficial fungi Mycorrhiza will grow to help the plant more easily absorb nutrients from the orchid growing medium.

24
00:05:24,874 --> 00:05:34,867
After soaking the orchid pot in this water for about 20 minutes, take the orchid pot out.

25
00:05:38,247 --> 00:05:40,247
Method 2.

26
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:06,228
Use this water to spray on the leaves.

27
00:06:06,228 --> 00:06:15,226
Helps supplement nutrients through leaves very effectively.

28
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:29,223
Helps orchid leaves become strong and healthy.

29
00:06:34,222 --> 00:06:44,220
and sprayed on aerial roots to help aerial roots grow and easily absorb nutrients in the air.

30
00:06:50,219 --> 00:07:00,217
You should do it early in the morning and by noon the leaves will dry very quickly.

31
00:07:08,215 --> 00:07:18,213
Do this once a week to keep the orchid healthy.

32
00:07:30,211 --> 00:07:33,210
Now I wash the leaves with this water.Method 3:

33
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:42,209
Now I wash the leaves with this water.

34
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:56,206
Beneficial microorganisms will help kill mold and insects very effectively.

35
00:08:01,205 --> 00:08:09,203
Do this every 2 weeks to protect your orchids.

36
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:29,233
Result

37
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:39,564
After fertilizing, orchids will always be green and healthy.

38
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:58,560
Potassium in banana peels and bread helps flower buds grow strongly.

39
00:09:08,558 --> 00:09:18,556
When the flowers bloom, they will stay on the branches for a long time.

40
00:09:26,555 --> 00:09:36,553
Flowers can last on branches for up to 6 months before fading.

41
00:09:41,552 --> 00:09:51,550
Hopefully the video will help you a lot in taking better care of orchids at home.

42
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:59,881
Thank you for watching the video. Good luck and see you in the next videos!
