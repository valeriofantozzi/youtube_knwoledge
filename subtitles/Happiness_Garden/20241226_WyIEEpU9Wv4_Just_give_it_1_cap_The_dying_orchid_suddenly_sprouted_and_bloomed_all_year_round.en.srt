nutrients from the roots to the

84
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:18,440

85
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,000
enough water and nutrients from the

86
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:24,440

uh instinctively when an orchid buds if

104
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,640
the plant lacks nutrients that the base

105
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,160
leaves will turn yellow and fall off to

106
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,160
provide nutrients for the buds to

107
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,160
develop

108
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,950
now I need to supplement the orchid's

109
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:45,600
