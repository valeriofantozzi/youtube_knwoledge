00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,720
Welcome to my channel. If you have an

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,120
orchid that looks weak and wilted like

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,440
this, don't be discouraged or throw it

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,599
away because right now I'm going to

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,640
share with you a simple yet very

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,800
effective way to revive it using only

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,520
natural fertilizer that you can easily

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,439
make at home. Let's get started and

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,439
you'll be amazed to see your orchid come

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,680
back to life so beautifully in just a

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,680
short time.

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,800
Um, first we need to gently remove all

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,440
the yellow and rotten leaves. This helps

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,559
the orchid breathe and prevents bacteria

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,559
from spreading to the healthy parts.

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,399
Next, carefully check the plant's roots

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,399
and growing medium.

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,079
And we also need to remove any remaining

19
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,120
inorganic fertilizer pellets along with

20
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,519
the old growing medium. Over time, these

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,200
pellets can build up salts that burn the

22
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,320
roots and make it hard for the plant to

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,840
absorb water. The old medium is often

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,760
decomposed,

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,360
retains moisture for too long, and

26
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,840
becomes a place where bacteria can

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,840
easily grow. So, replacing it is very

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,840
important.

29
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,119
Now, gently trim off all the roots that

30
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,119
are damaged, mushy, or have turned dark

31
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,119
brown.

32
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,520
These roots can no longer absorb water

33
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,479
or nutrients, so keeping them will only

34
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,320
weaken the orchid. When cutting, you

35
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,159
should use sterilized scissors or a

36
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,320
knife to prevent bacteria from entering

37
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,320
the wounds.

38
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,520
After removing the damaged roots, you'll

39
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,200
see a neater and healthier root system.

40
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:24,120
This is the foundation that helps the

41
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,120
plant recover and grow strong again.

42
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,319
Next, cut off all the flower spikes that

43
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,480
have faded and lost their petals. These

44
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,319
spikes can no longer support new blooms

45
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,599
and only continue to drain the plant's

46
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,160
nutrients. Once you remove them, all the

47
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,160
energy will be redirected to nourish the

48
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,640
roots and leaves, helping the plant

49
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,640
recover faster.

50
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,200
After that, rinse the entire plant under

51
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,519
a gentle stream of water. The water will

52
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,840
wash away dirt, remnants of the old

53
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,400
medium, and any bacteria clinging to the

54
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,319
roots. Be very gentle to avoid damaging

55
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,319
the new roots or the fragile base of the

56
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,319
plant.

57
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,800
When the plant is completely cleaned,

58
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,599
you'll see the roots looking brighter

59
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,720
and healthier, ready to absorb nutrients

60
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,800
for the next stage of recovery.

61
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,040
After rinsing, place the plant in a well

62
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,040
ventilated area and let the roots dry

63
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,040
naturally.

64
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,480
Next, prepare about 500 ml of clean

65
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,319
water in a container to start making the

66
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,319
recovery fertilizer for the wilted

67
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,319
leaves.

68
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,959
Then add about 1/3 teaspoon of sugar

69
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,959
into the container to mix with the

70
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,959
water.

71
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,880
Next, pour the diluted sugar water

72
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,400
solution in and soak the leaves for

73
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,400
about 20 minutes.

74
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,759
This soaking helps the wilted leaves

75
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,759
recover quickly as the sugar provides

76
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,400
instant energy, stimulating metabolism

77
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,400
and nutrient absorption.

78
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,120
Um, next, take about 500 ml of clean

79
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,160
water in a container to prepare the root

80
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,160
recovery fertilizer mixture.

81
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,759
The next ingredient is yeast. The yeast

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,240
will stimulate the growth of beneficial

83
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,240
microorganisms in the solution while

84
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:58,440
also releasing natural nutrients that

85
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,440
help the roots absorb better.

86
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,120
Add one teaspoon of this yeast into the

87
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,800
prepared water. Then stir well so the

88
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,199
yeast dissolves completely and starts

89
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,199
working effectively.

90
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,160
After stirring well, cover the container

91
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,240
and wait for about 20 minutes. During

92
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,560
this time, the yeast will multiply and

93
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,039
create an environment rich in beneficial

94
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:47,479
microorganisms, helping the plant roots

95
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,479
easily absorb natural nutrients.

96
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,960
After soaking the wilted leaves for

97
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,280
about 20 minutes, gently take out the

98
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,400
orchid and prepare for the next step,

99
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,400
stimulating root recovery.

100
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,759
Then take the diluted sugar water used

101
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,800
to soak the leaves and mix it with the

102
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,400
yeast solution. When combined, the two

103
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,720
solutions create a mixture rich in

104
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,960
nutrients and beneficial microorganisms,

105
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,960
helping the plant roots absorb maximum

106
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,960
nourishment.

107
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,720
Then soak the orchid roots in this

108
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,720
mixture for about 20 minutes.

109
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,800
When the roots are soaked in the

110
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,599
nutrient-rich solution with beneficial

111
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,919
microorganisms, the recovery process is

112
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:49,440
maximally stimulated. The roots will

113
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,360
quickly regain strength, grow new roots,

114
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,360
and be ready to nourish the leaves,

115
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,599
helping the orchid recover strongly and

116
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,599
grow evenly.

117
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,599
Next, you need to treat the growing

118
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,560
medium before replanting the orchid.

119
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,879
This helps remove bacteria, mold, or any

120
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,720
remaining debris, creating a clean and

121
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,720
airy environment for the roots to grow.

122
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,319
I put pine bark into the pot and pour

123
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,360
water to soak the medium, preparing for

124
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,599
the step of making the soaking solution.

125
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,080
The water will help soften the medium,

126
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,919
remove dirt, and allow it to absorb

127
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,159
nutrients from the recovery solution

128
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,159
more easily.

129
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,160
The ingredient for treating the growing

130
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,160
medium is baking soda.

131
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,920
Take one heaping teaspoon of baking soda

132
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,760
and dissolve it in the water in the pot.

133
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,920
This solution will help disinfect

134
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,760
bacteria and mold and clean the pine

135
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,680
bark, creating a safe environment for

136
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,680
the roots to anchor and absorb

137
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,680
nutrients.

138
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,000
Once the growing medium has been

139
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,680
thoroughly treated with baking soda, it

140
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,480
will become clean and safe for

141
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:22,200
replanting the orchid. A clean medium

142
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,200
helps the plant roots.

143
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,080
After soaking the roots for about 20

144
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,560
minutes, gently take out the orchid to

145
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,560
let the water drain.

146
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,800
At the same time, take out the pine bark

147
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,959
medium and let it drain completely

148
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,360
before replanting. This helps prevent

149
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,279
the roots from staying too wet. avoids

150
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,480
root rot and creates the best conditions

151
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,480
for the plant to absorb nutrients.

152
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,399
The diluted sugar and yeast mixture used

153
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,320
to soak the roots can be reused to water

154
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:04,040
the roots and growing medium of other

155
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,040
orchids in your garden.

156
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,519
The beneficial microorganisms from the

157
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,839
yeast along with the energy from the

158
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,760
sugar will create favorable conditions

159
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,160
for the orchid roots to grow quickly,

160
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,920
produce new roots, and help the plant

161
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,920
absorb water and nutrients more

162
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,920
efficiently.

163
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,560
When watered onto the basin roots, the

164
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,640
sugar provides instant energy,

165
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:39,240
stimulating metabolism and helping the

166
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,240
weak leaves become fresher and greener.

167
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,760
The beneficial microorganisms from the

168
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,959
yeast will balance the ecosystem in the

169
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,200
growing medium, reduce harmful bacteria,

170
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:59,320
help the plant be less prone to pests,

171
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,320
and promote sustainable growth.

172
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
This mixture also helps increase the

173
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,320
nutrient absorption capacity from the

174
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
growing medium. The plant roots will

175
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,399
easily take in minerals and natural

176
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,880
nutrients thanks to the environment rich

177
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:24,360
in microorganisms and nutrients that the

178
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,360
solution creates.

179
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,760
Evenly watering the orchid with the

180
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,120
sugar and yeast mixture helps it bloom

181
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,360
quickly and grow evenly. Healthy plants

182
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,120
with strong roots and vibrant green

183
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,279
leaves form the foundation for new

184
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,720
flower buds to appear, bringing

185
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,399
brilliant beauty and sustaining

186
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,399
long-lasting vitality in your garden.

187
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,720
Once the roots and growing medium have

188
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,760
drained, we proceed to plant the orchid

189
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,839
into a new pot. The pot I chose has

190
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,680
drainage holes at the bottom, allowing

191
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,760
excess water to escape quickly,

192
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,920
preventing water logging and root rot.

193
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,000
At the bottom of the pot, I place a few

194
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,839
pieces of foam to improve drainage and

195
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,839
create air flow for the roots.

196
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,920
At the same time, these foam pieces can

197
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,920
also be used to hold stakes, securing

198
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,399
the orchid when planting, helping the

199
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:32,440
plant stand upright, and the roots

200
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,440
anchor firmly into the medium.

201
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,120
After placing the plant in the pot, use

202
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,079
plastic clips to secure the orchid to

203
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,560
the steak. This clipping helps the plant

204
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,959
stand upright, allows the roots to

205
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,880
anchor firmly into the medium, and

206
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,880
prevents movement during the recovery

207
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,880
process.

208
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,560
Then gently tuck the growing medium

209
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,040
around the roots and the plant stem. Be

210
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,880
careful not to break or damage the roots

211
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,959
while also keeping the plant stable in

212
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,959
the pot.

213
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,320
After planting, place the orchid pot in

214
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,720
a well ventilated area for about 2

215
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,199
weeks. During this time, you don't need

216
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,959
to apply fertilizer, just lightly mist

217
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,959
with water to keep the roots and medium

218
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,360
moist.

219
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,600
If the orchid grows new roots during

220
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,079
this period, they will naturally absorb

221
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,839
nutrients and minerals from the medium,

222
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:29,639
helping the plant recover naturally

223
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,639
while still growing healthily.

224
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,959
After 2 weeks, when the plant roots have

225
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:43,240
stabilized and grown well, we can then

226
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,240
proceed to fertilize the orchid.

227
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,000
First, I use a soft cotton pad soaked in

228
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,160
the diluted sugar and yeast mixture to

229
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,040
carefully wipe both the top and

230
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,040
underside of the leaves.

231
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,800
This helps the nutrients penetrate

232
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,639
directly into the leaves, providing

233
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,160
instant energy and stimulating

234
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,839
metabolism.

235
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,240
At the same time, wiping the leaves

236
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,240
clean also removes dirt, bacteria, and

237
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:20,600
small insects, making the leaves

238
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,600
healthier and aiding in faster recovery.

239
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,320
Then, water the diluted sugar and yeast

240
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,079
mixture directly onto the roots and

241
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,399
growing medium.

242
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,399
This solution will provide nutrients and

243
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,399
beneficial microorganisms,

244
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,000
stimulate root growth, and increase the

245
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,320
ability to absorb water and minerals

246
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,320
from the medium.

247
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,560
Doing this leaf wiping and watering with

248
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,600
the mixture every 2 weeks will help the

249
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,680
plant grow many new roots. A healthy

250
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,240
root system will increase the ability to

251
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,160
absorb water and nutrients, thereby

252
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,800
helping wilted leaves recover quickly

253
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,800
and become vibrant.

254
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,560
Then place the orchid pot in a location

255
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,240
with gentle sunlight. The soft light

256
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,320
will help the plant photosynthesize

257
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:12,440
effectively, keeping the leaves green

258
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,440
and the roots growing evenly.

259
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,839
And here are the results after the next

260
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,759
month. You can see that although the

261
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,160
leaves are still soft and not fully

262
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,480
recovered, many new roots have grown and

263
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,160
are very healthy. This shows that the

264
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,880
orchid is actively recovering from

265
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,639
within and a strong root system will be

266
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,880
the foundation for the leaves to turn

267
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,880
green again.

268
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,959
As these new roots continue to grow,

269
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,519
they will help the plant absorb water

270
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,440
and nutrients quickly and efficiently.

271
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,199
As a result, the wrinkled weak leaves

272
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,839
will recover, becoming stronger and

273
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,839
greener day by day. A healthy root

274
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,639
system is the heart of the orchid,

275
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,799
ensuring that the leaves, flowers, and

276
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,120
the entire plant grow balanced, healthy,

277
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,120
and vibrant.

278
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,960
Once the root system is strong and well

279
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:49,120
established, from now on I will care for

280
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,120
the orchid using lightly fermented rice

281
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,120
water.

282
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,799
This solution provides natural nutrients

283
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,240
rich in beneficial microorganisms,

284
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,919
helping the roots maintain healthy

285
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,160
growth and keeping the leaves vibrant

286
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,160
and green.

287
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,440
Regular care using lightly fermented

288
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,200
rice water. applied every 2 weeks

289
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,600
combined with thorough watering when the

290
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,559
growing medium is dry will support the

291
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,559
orchid's overall development.

292
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,640
This method helps the roots absorb

293
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,720
nutrients effectively, boosts the

294
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,039
vitality of the leaves, and promotes

295
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,640
rapid recovery of the plant. In

296
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,799
particular, the wrinkled leaves will

297
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,200
quickly become firm again, turning green

298
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,960
and healthy, creating a solid foundation

299
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,200
for the plant to bloom evenly in the

300
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,200
coming period.

301
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,640
And here are the results after the next

302
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:11,360
3 months. You can see that the leaves

303
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,480
have fully recovered, becoming strong,

304
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,640
vibrant, and much healthier. This shows

305
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,440
that the orchid has successfully revived

306
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,799
with a healthy root system, lush green

307
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,720
leaves, and is ready to support

308
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,720
beautiful blooms in the coming seasons.

309
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,919
And you can see that the root system has

310
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,240
grown very strong and is firmly anchored

311
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:42,320
in the medium. This shows that the

312
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,240
orchid has fully recovered from within,

313
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,400
ready to absorb water and nutrients to

314
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,400
the fullest.

315
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,200
Thanks to strong roots, green leaves,

316
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,760
and a stable plant, the orchid will grow

317
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,480
evenly, ready to produce buds and bloom

318
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,559
in the next season. A solid root system

319
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,559
ensures the plant absorbs enough water

320
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,880
and nutrients, helping the flowers bloom

321
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:09,080
beautifully and last long, while keeping

322
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,080
the leaves vibrant and green.

323
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,080
When the orchid is properly cared for,

324
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,720
from roots to leaves, you will see it

325
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,880
full of vitality, creating a strong

326
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,520
foundation for brilliant blooms in the

327
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,520
seasons to come.

328
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,600
Take care of your orchids with all the

329
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,520
love and patience you have for plants.

330
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,240
Gradually, your orchid collection will

331
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,320
recover, grow, and bloom beautifully

332
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,280
throughout the garden, bringing vibrant

333
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,360
beauty and full of life. Just like in my

334
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,280
orchid garden, each plant will shine in

335
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,360
its own way, creating a wonderful

336
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,520
natural space where you can enjoy the

337
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,840
joy, the joy, and tranquility of flowers

338
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,840
and foliage.

339
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,520
That's everything I wanted to share with
