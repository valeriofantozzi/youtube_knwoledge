00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:06,601 --> 00:00:14,898
This orchid has yellow leaf disease.

3
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:28,895
The cause is due to insects sucking tree sap and then being infected with fungi and bacteria through insect bites.

4
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:38,893
This disease leaves the leaves still succulent but falls off very quickly.

5
00:00:40,892 --> 00:00:50,890
Only one healthy leaf remains. The rest are infected.

6
00:00:56,691 --> 00:01:03,888
I cut here to check for disease inside the stem.

7
00:01:15,767 --> 00:01:26,883
All infected leaves need to be removed.

8
00:01:37,115 --> 00:01:48,879
Black spots are where the disease resides so they need to be removed.

9
00:02:16,873 --> 00:02:26,871
then take 5 spoons of cement.

10
00:02:39,341 --> 00:02:50,900
Mix 5 liters of water.

11
00:03:01,006 --> 00:03:09,896
Then wait for the sediment to settle.

12
00:03:19,097 --> 00:03:22,894
10 Minutes later.

13
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:41,890
Take only the clear water at the top.

14
00:03:59,886 --> 00:04:09,884
Clean orchid branches with cement water.

15
00:05:03,656 --> 00:05:16,522
Soak the orchid pot in cement water for 10 minutes

16
00:05:21,951 --> 00:05:29,868
Soak the moss in cement water for 10 minutes.

17
00:05:52,073 --> 00:06:02,895
Soak 10 eggshells in 2 liters of boiled water.

18
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:14,893
Wait for the water to cool.

19
00:06:17,363 --> 00:06:27,890
In the meantime, I recycle plastic bottles into orchid nursery equipment.

20
00:07:14,202 --> 00:07:26,879
Take 3 more Vitamin B1 tablets and mix them into eggshell water.

21
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:45,875
Soak the orchid branches in this water for 20 minutes.

22
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,872
20 minutes later.

23
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:18,868
Sprinkle cement powder on the cut.

24
00:09:01,226 --> 00:09:09,892
Place the orchid branch in.

25
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:17,890
Pour some water into the plate.

26
00:09:20,987 --> 00:09:30,887
Place in a cool place, avoid direct sunlight.

27
00:09:32,345 --> 00:09:42,885
After 1 week, spray water every 5 days.

28
00:09:50,805 --> 00:09:58,882
Water from eggshells and B1.

29
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:05,880
Pour some water into the bowl.

30
00:10:19,191 --> 00:10:29,876
Leave in a cool place, after 1 week spray water every 5 days.

31
00:10:45,106 --> 00:10:48,872
1 MONTH LATER.

32
00:10:52,971 --> 00:11:02,869
Roots grow very strongly.

33
00:11:02,869 --> 00:11:10,868
Now plant it in a pot so it can grow outside

34
00:11:19,014 --> 00:11:26,898
Under the orchid tree, two more small orchids have grown.

35
00:11:32,783 --> 00:11:40,895
