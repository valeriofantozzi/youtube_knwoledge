00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
Welcome everyone to my Happiness Garden channel!

2
00:00:09,899 --> 00:00:18,897
You see this is an orchid rotten by the bacteria that causes orchid rot.

3
00:00:19,897 --> 00:00:30,894
With orchid branches like this, people often throw them away.

4
00:00:34,894 --> 00:00:44,892
But don't throw it away, let me guide you to revive it quickly.

5
00:00:51,890 --> 00:01:01,888
First, cut off all the rotten areas.

6
00:01:19,774 --> 00:01:29,883
Next, take 1 teaspoon of cloves.

7
00:01:36,881 --> 00:01:46,879
And add 1 clove of garlic.

8
00:01:56,877 --> 00:02:06,875
Add 300ml of water.

9
00:02:20,873 --> 00:02:28,871
Then puree.

10
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:58,898
Filter out residue.

11
00:03:03,897 --> 00:03:12,896
Add 2 liters of water.

12
00:03:19,894 --> 00:03:29,892
Wipe orchid branches with this garlic and clove solution.

13
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:44,956
This helps eliminate harmful fungi and stimulates growth.

14
00:03:55,887 --> 00:04:05,885
Then soak the stem in this solution for 30 minutes.

15
00:04:15,883 --> 00:04:25,881
While waiting, I used this solution to water other orchids..

16
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:42,211
This helps prevent harmful fungi and stimulates growth for orchids.

17
00:04:50,876 --> 00:05:00,874
Helps orchids increase resistance and grow healthily.

18
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,869
30 MINUTES LATER.

19
00:05:32,868 --> 00:05:38,900
Blot dry.

20
00:06:08,894 --> 00:06:18,892
Use cinnamon powder to sprinkle on the cut.

21
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:36,889
Helps cuts heal quickly and protects orchids from rotting.

22
00:06:48,886 --> 00:06:58,884
Next I used cotton to make rope.

23
00:07:29,878 --> 00:07:39,876
Then wrap this string around the orchid stem.

24
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:18,868
Then I put the orchid branches in a glass jar.

25
00:08:18,868 --> 00:08:28,900
then pour water into the bottle.

26
00:08:35,898 --> 00:08:46,896
Water will penetrate the cotton fibers to help the orchid stem always have moderate moisture.

27
00:08:51,895 --> 00:09:01,893
Then cover the top with a clear plastic bottle like a miniature greenhouse.

28
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:10,891
and place it in a cool, well-lit place to wait for the orchid to revive.

29
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:26,888
ONE MONTH LATER.

30
00:09:43,885 --> 00:09:55,882
The orchid has grown many roots.

31
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:12,879
With this simple method, you can easily revive weak orchids.

32
00:10:20,878 --> 00:10:30,876
Cotton fibers always absorb water to create appropriate humidity, so orchids develop roots very quickly.

33
00:10:46,284 --> 00:10:56,282
Now I plant it in a pot so the orchid can grow in an outside environment.

34
00:11:03,869 --> 00:11:15,900
Below I use a medium made of terracotta beads and aquaponic plastic beads to help with good drainage.

35
00:11:17,782 --> 00:11:26,898
Spread a layer of dry moss on top to keep it moist.

36
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:46,894
Then you water it to keep it moist and leave it in a cool place with enough light for the orchid to grow.

37
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:58,891
Thank you for watching the video. Good luck and see you in the next videos.
