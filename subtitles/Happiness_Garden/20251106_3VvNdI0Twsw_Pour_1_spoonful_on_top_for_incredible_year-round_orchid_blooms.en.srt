Welcome to our garden where every leaf

00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,680
and every flower is nurtured with

00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,599

Each moment with the orchid pot becomes

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,280
a relaxing and inspiring experience.

This is an orchid that once bloomed

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,640
beautifully, but now it has withered and

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,960
become so stunted that it seems beyond

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,559
saving. Some even think it should be

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,879
thrown away, but with just a little

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,879
patience and love, a miracle can still

21
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,879

26
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,600
First, gently check the orchid's root

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,920
system. You may notice that many roots

28
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,439
are dried out or severely damaged. This

29
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,600
is the reason why the plant is weakened

30
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,600
and unable to absorb enough water and

31
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,600
nutrients.

[Music]

33
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,159
The next step is to cut off the damaged

34
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,880
roots. Uh, this helps the plant stop

35
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,200
wasting energy on dead roots and instead

36
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,820
focus on nourishing and developing new,

37
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,660
healthier ones.

39
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,840
Removing weak roots also creates more

40
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,120
space in the pot, allowing new roots to

41
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,200
grow and develop more strongly. When the

42
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,239
roots are healthy, the entire plant will

43
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,239
gradually regain its vitality.

45
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,480
If the roots are not cleaned and treated

46
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,959
properly, the plant will have difficulty

47
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,200
recovering even with regular watering

48
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,200

Removing weak roots not only helps the

plant focus on nourishing new roots, but

51
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,400
also prevents the spread of harmful

52
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,120
fungi and bacteria. This is an important

53
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,200
step to protect the orchid from root rot

54
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,200

55
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,200
recovery.

56
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,280
For wilted flowers, cutting them off is

57
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,280
necessary so the plant no longer wastes

58
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,400
energy maintaining what has already

59
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,239
faded. This allows the orchid to focus

60
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,000
on nourishing its roots and leaves,

61
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,000

67

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,400
them will help the plant stay airy,

69
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,640

cling to the roots after the plant has

Cleaning away the buildup of mineral

192
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,959
After soaking for about 20 minutes,

193
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,160
gently remove the orchid and plant it in

194
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:16,560
a new pot.

195
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,560
I use moss to grow orchids because it

196
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,040
retains moisture well, allows good air

197
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,160
circulation, and is ideal for orchids in

198
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,320
the recovery stage. Moss is a great

199
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,959
material for maintaining stable moisture

200
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,200
for orchid roots. It holds water while

201
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,200
remaining breathable, providing ideal

202
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,760
conditions for new roots to grow without

203
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,760
the risk of rot.

204
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,120
Repotting orchids creates the best

205
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,600
conditions for the plant to grow. A well

206
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,440
ventilated, clean pot and growing medium

207
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,839
provide an ideal environment for the

208
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,839
roots to absorb nutrients from fresh

209
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,839
moss.

210
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,920
The soft texture of moss is ideal for

211
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,839
newly grown orchid roots. Young roots

212
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,480
can attach and grow easily without

213
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,480
damage or obstruction.

214
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,279
Some types of moss, especially Pete

215
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,519
moss, also have mild antibacterial

216
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,760
properties that help limit the growth of

217
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,760
mold and bacteria in the growing

218
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:21,160
environment, keeping the area around the

219
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,160
roots cleaner.

220
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,800
From now on, water the orchid once every

221
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,600
10 days with the honey, aloe vera, and

222
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,279
vitamin B1 mixture. This will help the

223
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,120
plant maintain moisture, recover

224
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,000
quickly, and stimulate the growth of

225
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,929
healthy new roots.

growing medium is dry, simply water or

229
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,880
mist the orchid to maintain moisture.

230
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,399
Providing this gentle moisture helps

231
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,910
keep the orchid fresh and healthy

232
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:59,120
without causing root rot.

Then place the orchid pot in a spot with

235
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,680
gentle sunlight. Soft sunlight provides

236
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,600
enough energy for the plant to grow

237
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,650
without burning the leaves or causing

238
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,279
damage from excessive heat.

orchids.

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,079
This will help stimulate root growth and

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,240
promote the development of new shoots,

245
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,240
improving the plant's overall health and

You can see that my orchid cared for
