00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,879
Welcome to the garden where every orchid

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,080
tells its own story and every moment of

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,080
care brings joy and peace.

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,080
In this video, I will share a simple way

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,760
to help a sick orchid recover quickly

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,160
while also stimulating the plant to

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,320
produce many keis at the same time.

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,000
Thanks to that, in one orchid pot, you

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,840
will see many young plants growing

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,510
together, bringing a brilliant blooming

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:33,059
season with lots of flowers.

[Music]

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,520
Let's get started.

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,760
This is an orchid suffering from rot

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,000
mainly caused by the attack of fungi and

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,090
bacteria which damage and weaken the

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,590
leaves.

19
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:47,590
[Music]

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,920
If rot is not treated in time, it will

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,480
quickly spread and can cause the entire

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,480
orchid to die.

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,600
Uh please comment and let me know which

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,359
country you are watching the video from.

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,640
It's wonderful that we can connect and

26
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:07,040
chat from all over the world.

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,960
The rotten parts after being removed

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,960
need to be carefully disinfected or

29
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,840
destroyed far from the garden to avoid

30
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,840
spreading to other plants.

31
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,040
Um, I need to check the roots because

32
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,040
when an orchid rots, it is often due to

33
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,200
water logging in the roots, which causes

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,600
root suffocation and gradual weakening

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,600
of the plant.

36
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,880
It is necessary to cut off all the

37
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,799
damaged roots, helping the orchid avoid

38
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,720
the spread of pathogens and creating

39
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,720
conditions for new healthy roots to

40
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,720
grow.

45

along for the journey.

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,880
After that, wash the orchid thoroughly

47
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,000
with water to completely remove any

48
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,000
remaining bacteria and fungi.

[Music]

50
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,080
Next, prepare four cups of water,

51
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,080
approximately one liter, to proceed with

52
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:24,269
the next care step for the orchid.

53
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:24,269
[Music]

54
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,959
Then add five tablets of vitamin B1,

55
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,800
each 2.5 mg. Vitamin B1 helps the orchid

56
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,640
recover quickly, stimulates new root

57
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:45,889
growth, and boosts resistance.

[Music]

59
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,640
Next, take an aloe vera leaf and cut it

60
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,560
into thin slices. Aloe vera is rich in

61
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,920
nutrients, very good for restoring weak

62
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,920
orchids and helping the roots grow

63
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,920
quickly.

64
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,200
Add the aloe vera slices together with

65
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,720
the vitamin B1 to create a nutrient

66
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,400
mixture that helps the orchid recover

67
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,400
quickly and stimulates root growth.

68
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,440
Then wait about 30 minutes for the

69
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,360
nutrients to fully dissolve in the

70
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,519
water, ready for the next care step for

71
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,519
the orchid.

72
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,280
Then strain the water to remove the

73
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,120
residue, keeping only the nutrient-rich

74
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:45,740
solution for the orchid.

75
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:45,740
[Music]

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,599
Then use this solution to soak the

77
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,200
orchid's roots for about 20 minutes,

78
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,959
helping the roots absorb nutrients,

79
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,360
recover quite quickly, and stimulate

80
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,360
healthy growth.

[Music]

82
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,640
I chose crushed pine bark as the growing

83
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,879
medium because it helps maintain just

84
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,519
the right moisture and ensures good

85
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,519
drainage for the orchid.

86
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,639
Then gently place the orchid into the

87
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,400
growing medium, keeping the roots

88
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,800
comfortable and free from bending or

89
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,880
damage.

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,040
The white beads are resin beads used in

91
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,960
hydroponic gardening. When mixed with

92
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,880
crushed pine bark, they help increase

93
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:39,199
irration for the orchid roots.

94
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,960
Finally, add a thin layer of moss on top

95
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,479
to retain moisture and create a good

96
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,460
environment for the orchid roots to

97
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:51,970
grow.

Then take cotton balls and soak them in

100
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,639
the vitamin B1 and aloe vera mixture.

101
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,800
Then use them to wrap the orchid's

102
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,400
roots, helping retain moisture and

103
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,990
allowing the roots to absorb nutrients

104
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:30,160
