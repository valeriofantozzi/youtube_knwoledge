00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:12,898
To help you have many options when caring for orchids at home with organic fertilizer.

3
00:00:12,898 --> 00:00:22,896
Helps develop new shoots. Flowers bloom profusely and last long.

4
00:00:22,896 --> 00:00:32,894
In this video, I share how to make organic fertilizer from pineapple waste.

5
00:00:42,977 --> 00:00:53,890
Because pineapple peel and pulp contain a lot of nutrients for orchids such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium

6
00:00:53,890 --> 00:01:03,888
and other micronutrients necessary for the growth and development of orchids.

7
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:18,885
Take the pineapple peel and put it in a jar.

8
00:01:19,576 --> 00:01:28,883
and pour in 2 liters of warm water.

9
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:41,380
Add 1 teaspoon of yeast (the type of yeast commonly used to make bread).

10
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:54,878
Add 3 tablespoons of sugar.

11
00:02:14,138 --> 00:02:26,871
Cover the jar with a plastic bag and create ventilation holes to prevent the jar from exploding during fermentation.

12
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:39,869
Then leave in a cool place for 1 month.

13
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:45,868
1 MONTH LATER.

14
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:04,897
Now I take 3 tablespoons of this GE pineapple fertilizer.

15
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:20,894
Mix with 2 liters of water.

16
00:03:20,894 --> 00:03:24,893
FIRST METHOD.

17
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:36,891
Use this liquid fertilizer to fertilize orchid roots.

18
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:56,887
Using GE fertilizer from pineapple helps orchids grow stronger and bloom more..

19
00:04:11,888 --> 00:04:22,882
Fertilizer from GE pineapple also helps improve flower quality, making flowers larger, brighter in color and with a unique aroma.

20
00:04:33,716 --> 00:04:42,878
You can fertilize this fertilizer 1-2 times/month.

21
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:55,875
SECOND METHOD.

22
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:09,872
You can also use a spray bottle to spray this liquid fertilizer on the leaves, stems, and roots of your orchid.

23
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:25,869
This type of fertilizer not only provides nutrients but also has a very good bactericidal effect.

24
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:44,899
GE Pineapple fertilizer will create a favorable environment for beneficial microorganisms,

25
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:54,897
help improve the metabolic process in the orchid growing environment and create good conditions for orchids to grow.

26
00:06:04,495 --> 00:06:14,893
This method is also performed 1-2 times/month.

27
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:20,892
3 WEEKS LATER

28
00:06:22,514 --> 00:06:32,889
The tree has sprouted.

29
00:06:50,302 --> 00:06:54,885
6 WEEKS LATER.

30
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:09,882
Shoots grow very healthily.

31
00:07:25,182 --> 00:07:35,877
only these new shoots are capable of flowering.

32
00:07:42,765 --> 00:07:52,874
Therefore, the more new buds there are, the more flower buds the orchid pot will have in the future.

33
00:07:57,584 --> 00:08:07,871
GE fertilizer helps flowers grow bigger and brighter, with bright colors and unique fragrance.

34
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:27,900
Using GE fertilizer from pineapple waste is a way to protect the environment,

35
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:37,898
helps reuse and recycle organic waste, reduce environmental pollution and minimize waste of resources.

36
00:08:40,858 --> 00:08:50,895
