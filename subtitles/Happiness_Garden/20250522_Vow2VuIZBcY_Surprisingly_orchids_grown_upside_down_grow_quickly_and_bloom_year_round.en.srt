00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,919
Welcome to the happiness garden. Today I

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,480
will share with you how to grow orchids

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,000
using the inverted planting method. This

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,840
is a technique that helps orchids grow

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,280
healthily and bloom regularly all year

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,440
round. With this method, the roots will

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,680
have better air circulation, helping to

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,520
absorb nutrients effectively, thereby

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,840
making the plant more vigorous and the

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,000
flowers bloom more brilliantly. Let's

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,000
get started.

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,960
If you have a weak or weak orchid that

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,960
you've been caring for a long time, but

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,049
it still doesn't grow or bloom, then

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,840
follow this method of

16
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:38,960
[Music]

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,640
mine. First, we need to check the

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,879
orchid's root system to see if there are

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,879
any

20
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:48,000
problems. Because the roots are the most

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,920
important part that determines the

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
overall health of the plant. If they are

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,920
rotten, dry, or no longer functioning

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,920
well, the plant will have a hard time

25
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:01,680
growing. Healthy roots are usually ivory

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,199
white or fresh green, while damaged

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,199
roots are brown, black, or

28
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:12,119
mushy. Then cut off all the damaged

29
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,119
roots.

30
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,520
You can see that the roots of this

31
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,520
orchid are almost completely rotten,

32
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,360
causing the plant to lose its ability to

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,439
absorb water and nutrients from the

34
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,560
[Music]

35
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,640
environment. Cutting off the damaged

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,720
roots helps prevent the spread of root

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,920
rot disease, thereby protecting the

38
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,920
healthy remaining roots of the plant.

39
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,799
After treating the roots, you should

40
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,320
also cut off the wilted leaves, damaged

41
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,320
leaves, or those showing signs of

42
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,759
disease. Old, dry, or rotten leaves not

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,280
only spoil the appearance, but also

44
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,320
consume a lot of the plant's energy

45
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,320
without providing any benefits.

46
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,119
Removing damaged leaves helps the plant

47
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,280
concentrate nutrients on the healthy

48
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,640
parts while also reducing the risk of

49
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,600
disease spreading from the leaves to

50
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:16,040
other

52
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,800
parts. When the plant is cleaned up like

53
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,360
this, the recovery and growth process

54
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,360
will happen faster.

After cutting off the damaged roots and

59
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,160
leaves, the next step is to wash the

60
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,160
entire plant with clean

61
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,599

62
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,920
impurities, and any remaining bacteria

63
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,360

71

Next, take about 0.5 L of clean water

72
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,080
and pour it into a cup or small

73
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,260

74
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:59,760
solution for the orchid.

76
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,450
Then add about a/ teaspoon of pure honey

77
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:24,369
into the cup of water.

79
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:30,600
And finally, add three vitamin B1

80
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,600

honey and vitamin B1 are completely

84
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,280
dissolved in the water. This way you

85
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,639
have a very good natural fertilizer

86
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,150

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:12,320

89
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,320
Then soak the entire orchid in the

natural fertilizer solution you just

91
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,440
prepared for about 20

nutrients from the honey and vitamin B1

94
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,400
penetrate deeply into the roots and

95
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,560

96
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,340

Next, you will need to prepare baking

100
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,720

101
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,690

orchids today is moss a very common and

107
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,479
suitable medium for orchids because of

its good moisture retention and

110
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,919
need to sterilize the moss thoroughly to

Then we proceed to plant the orchid

197
00:12:46,800 --> 00:13:09,220

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,920
After planting, you should hang the

202
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,240
orchid pot in a place with gentle

203
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,560
sunlight avoiding harsh direct light so

204
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,360
the plant does not get stressed. Uh

205
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:42,639
during the first week after planting do

206
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,639
not water the plant

207
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:52,240
but after one week prepare the honey and

208
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,760
vitamin B1 solution again as I

209
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,760
instructed at the beginning of the

[Music]

212
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,000
Then use a spray bottle to evenly mist

213
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:24,440
the honey and vitamin B1 solution over

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,440
the entire orchid and growing medium.

215
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,519
Even spraying helps the nutrients

216
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,079
penetrate deeply not only into the roots

217
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,320
but also onto the leaves and stem

218
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,520

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:44,299

after 1 month of caring for the orchid

229
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,120
using the upside down planting method I

230
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,120
demonstrated.

231
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,120
Uh after this period you will see the

232
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,700
orchid clearly recovering with roots

233
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:28,130

easily see many new roots have grown

246
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,690
vigorously around the base of the

247
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:34,720
orchid.

249
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,720
The young white healthy roots are a

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,240
clear sign that the plant is recovering

251
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,790
well and absorbing nutrients

252
00:17:40,240 --> 00:18:02,400

Stimulating root growth not only helps

255
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,960
the plant anchor firmly to the growing

256
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,280
medium, but also increases its ability

257
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,880
to absorb water and nutrients, making

258
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,840
the plant healthier and bloom more

259
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,280
regularly. This is proof of the

260
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,480
effectiveness of the upside down

261
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,480
planting method I just shared.

262
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,640
After carefully checking the orchid

263
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,120
roots and seeing that the new roots have

264
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:33,880
grown strong, I proceed to replant the

265
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,880
orchid using the moist moss layer.

should continue caring for the orchid

271
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:11,000
using the liquid fertilizer mixture made

272
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,000

orchid two to three times per month.

276
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:47,979

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,840
a spot with gentle sunlight, such as

280
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,280
near a window or under a tree canopy, so

281
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,280
the plant can photosynthesize

grown vigorously with strong roots, lush
