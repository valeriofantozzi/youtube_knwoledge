00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,040
fast when I just bought orchids we

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,040
remove all this

7
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:24,320
Moss uh because these Orchid pots are

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,519
grown in an industrial environment

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,840
controlled by temperature humidity and

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,719
it uh ideal for orchids

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,320
but when brought back the environment

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,399
has changed making these roots

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,280
susceptible to rot therefore you should

14
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:40,280
cut off damaged

15
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:45,559

require watering but will still help

26
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,970

27
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:32,090

00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,680
repurpose used

32
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:47,000

environment often in contact with water

67
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,639
