Cutting off damaged roots helps remove

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,520
rotting, non-developing roots, prevents

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,850
the spread of diseases, and stimulates

prevent the spread of diseases, reduces

25
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,000
the risk of infection, and allows the

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,439
the orchid grows

31
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:39,280

mixture, you should gently wipe off any

196
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,240
water remaining on the leaves,

197
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,070
especially the underside to prevent mold

198
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:54,720
or leaf rot.

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,000
You should place the orchid pot in a

201
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,279
spot with gentle indirect light so the

202
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,279
plant can photosynthesize

203
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:10,240
better. Take care of your orchids with

204
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,920
all the love you have for plants and

205
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,440
you'll be rewarded with beautiful

206
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,440
flowers that you've nurtured yourself.
