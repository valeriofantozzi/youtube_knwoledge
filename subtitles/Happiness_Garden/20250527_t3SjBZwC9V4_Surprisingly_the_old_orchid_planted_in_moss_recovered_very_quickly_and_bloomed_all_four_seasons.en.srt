Welcome to Happiness Garden, where every

00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,040
leaf and every petal tells us a gentle

00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,780
story of love for nature and care from

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,920
wonders that come from the smallest

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,279
things in this

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,279
garden. After buying an orchid and

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,840
enjoying its blooms, the plant often

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:28,119
starts to decline. Yellowing leaves,

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,119
weak roots, and a tired look.

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,480
Sadly, many people throw it away too

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,399
soon, not knowing there's still a strong

15
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,399
life force inside waiting to be

16
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,840
revived. Many orchids here have been

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,840
discarded

19
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:55,039
wastefully. This orchid, although

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,680
weakened, still has fresh green leaves,

21
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,239
a sign that it's alive. So, I decided to

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,840
take it home to care for and revive it,

23
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,840
hoping to bring it back to full

24
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:13,200
strength. We need to gently remove the

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,680
old growing medium, which may hold dust

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,360
and bacteria, and repot the orchid into

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,000
a new container to give it a better

28
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,000
environment to grow.

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,799
This helps the roots breathe and absorb

30
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,840

31
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,840

roots, those that are rotten or no

36
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,960

37
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,960

52
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,680
Next, we remove the wilted and yellow

53
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,440

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,840

harmful

57
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,040
allows it to focus nutrients on healthy

59
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,959
Next, we rinse the entire orchid

60
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,519
thoroughly with clean water to remove

61
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,799
dust, bacteria, and impurities from the

leaves, roots, and

63
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:40,239

64
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,159
environment, reduces the risk of

65
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,680

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,670

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,159
eliminate bacteria, mold, and harmful

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:12,120

76
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,199
I soak the moss in hot water to

the banana extract, GE, helps the orchid

194
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:07,399
petals last longer, potentially keeping

195
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,399
the flowers fresh for up to 6 months.

196
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,000
Now, I invite you to join me in seeing

197
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:19,519
the results after 3 weeks of orchid

198
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,800
recovery. Oh, can you see the new white

199
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,800
root growing inside the orchid

200
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:32,519
pot? Let's check the roots inside the

201
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,519
orchid pot together.

[Music]

203
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,360
Wow. You can see the orchid has grown

204
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,680
many new roots which shows the plant is

205
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,560
recovering very well and ready for the

206
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,560
next strong growth phase.

207
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,160
These new roots increase its ability to

208
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,490
absorb water and nutrients, bringing

209
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:10,450

222
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:50,240
me. Once the orchid has developed many

223
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,839
new roots, I transplanted into a new pot

224
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,839
filled with pine bark as the growing

225
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,839
medium.

226
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,399
Pine bark improves irerration and

227
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,399
drainage, creating an ideal environment

228
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,639
for the roots to grow stronger, helping

229
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,760
the plant become healthier and ready for

230
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,760
vibrant blooming cycles ahead.

growing tips. Um, it's great to have you

236
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,760
along. After planting, we prepare

237
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,760
natural fertilizer to care for the

238
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,760
orchid.

239
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,800
To make natural fertilizer, I take I

240
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:44,160
take one tablespoon of wheat flour

241
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,160
diluted in one liter of

242
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,639
water. This mixture provides gentle

243
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,639
nutrients and helps stimulate beneficial

244
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,240
microorganisms in the growing medium,

245
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,199
contributing to the orchid's health

246
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,199
naturally and

247
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,580
[Music]

248
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,000
effectively. After mixing, strain out

249
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,759
the sediment so the solution becomes

250
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,210
clear and can penetrate the growing

251
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,309
medium and roots more

252
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:14,309
[Music]

253
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:20,160
easily. This helps the natural

254
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,519
fertilizer work most effectively without

255
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,519
clogging or harming the

256
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:31,839
orchid. Then apply this fertilizer twice

257
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,720
a month to provide consistent nut

258
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,560
nutrients for the orchid.

259
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,800
Regular feeding helps the plant grow

260
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,900
steadily, boosts its resistance, and

261
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:45,240
prepares it well for future blooming

00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:47,920
[Music]

263
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,920
cycles. Then place the orchid pot in a

264
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,079
spot with gentle sunlight so the plant

265
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,759
can photosynthesize. Only with good

266
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,810
photosynthesis can the orchid absorb

267
00:16:53,759 --> 00:17:06,000
nutrients effectively.

269
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,679
And here is the result after 5 months of

270
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,959
recovery.

271
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:15,039
Like you can see that the orchid has

272
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,839
grown vigorously with many new roots

273
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:19,770
growing and the leaves are greener and

274
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,760
shinier than
