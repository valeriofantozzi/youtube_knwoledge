Welcome to Happiness Garden channel

2
00:00:05,232 --> 00:00:15,231
There are different ways to revive old, wilted, rootless orchids

3
00:00:24,564 --> 00:00:33,561
This video will add a new way for you to have more choices

4
00:00:50,191 --> 00:01:00,189
Cut off all damaged roots

5
00:02:07,537 --> 00:02:17,507
Rinse with water

6
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:33,970
Use 1 clove of garlic

7
00:02:58,046 --> 00:03:08,030
300ml of water at room temperature

8
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:22,894
Puree

9
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:46,123
Filter out residue

10
00:03:48,386 --> 00:03:56,354
add 700ml of water

11
00:03:58,722 --> 00:04:06,718
Soak orchid branches in garlic water for 30 minutes

12
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:25,082
After soaking for 30 minutes, take it out and dry it

13
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:50,676
Sprinkle cinnamon powder on the cut and orchid root

14
00:04:52,998 --> 00:05:02,974
This helps the cut to heal quickly and is highly resistant to rot

15
00:05:07,302 --> 00:05:16,271
Use bricks with holes like this

16
00:05:18,345 --> 00:05:26,336
then you recycle 5 liter plastic bottles like i do here

17
00:05:34,457 --> 00:05:46,465
Add water like I do

18
00:06:02,802 --> 00:06:12,794
Plug the orchid branch into the hole of the building brick

19
00:06:15,318 --> 00:06:25,291
2 days misting 1 time

20
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:36,022
Place it next to a window or a place with light

21
00:06:37,474 --> 00:06:46,454
but avoid direct sunlight

22
00:06:49,378 --> 00:06:52,352
45 Days Later

23
00:06:56,659 --> 00:07:06,650
Orchids have developed very healthy roots

24
00:07:09,901 --> 00:07:15,850
In this way,

25
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:27,579
bricks do the job of absorbing water and keeping moisture very well

26
00:07:29,935 --> 00:07:32,911
Therefore,

27
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:43,925
it will create a favorable environment for orchids to recover

28
00:07:43,925 --> 00:07:48,008
 and grow very well

29
00:07:50,874 --> 00:07:59,872
From now on, spray organic foliar fertilizer once a week like I shared on the channel.

30
00:08:07,223 --> 00:08:11,929
AFTER THE NEXT 3 MONTHS

31
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:26,900
With a very good orchid growing environment, the orchids recovered and grew quickly.

32
00:08:38,273 --> 00:08:48,896
From leaves to roots and flower buds grow wonderfully.

33
00:08:55,259 --> 00:09:02,226
Many flower buds grow at the same time.

34
00:09:08,046 --> 00:09:18,023
Only healthy orchids produce so many flower buds at the same time.

35
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:30,887
Hopefully the video will help you a lot in taking better care of orchids at home.
