00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:31,085
welcome to my channel

2
00:00:32,352 --> 00:00:38,326
When eating cucumbers, don't throw away the skins

3
00:00:38,326 --> 00:00:46,160
I will guide you to recycle cucumber peel to make organic fertilizer for orchids

4
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,777
it will become a free but extremely good fertilizer for orchids

5
00:00:52,777 --> 00:01:00,204
Cucumber peel is a rich source of nutrients,

6
00:01:00,204 --> 00:01:08,892
including potassium, calcium and magnesium.

7
00:01:08,892 --> 00:01:14,254
When recycled into organic fertilizer,

8
00:01:14,254 --> 00:01:19,621
These nutrients can help power orchids,

9
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:26,856
helping them to grow and bloom better.

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Use the rind of 1 cucumber

11
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:54,056
1 liter of water at room temperature

12
00:02:02,743 --> 00:02:09,062
puree

13
00:02:12,114 --> 00:02:16,853
filter out residue

14
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:28,595
take 1 part of this water

15
00:02:32,515 --> 00:02:49,157
Use this water to care for the leaves

16
00:02:49,157 --> 00:03:04,627
Clean both the top and bottom of the leaves

17
00:03:04,627 --> 00:03:18,550
Organic fertilizer from cucumber peel can help strengthen the resistance of orchids

18
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:29,037
and reduce the risk of diseases and pests.

19
00:03:30,758 --> 00:03:42,870
Next, you clip cotton soaked in cucumber juice to the flower branches like this

20
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:54,891
Will help flower buds grow faster

21
00:03:54,891 --> 00:04:08,792
The flower branches will grow very quickly

22
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:27,209
Do this once a week

23
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:37,781
The flowers backed by recycled organic cucumber peel are brilliant.

24
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:50,502
Many flowers bloom on the same branch.

25
00:04:50,502 --> 00:05:04,212
But flowers bloom for a long time.

26
00:05:04,212 --> 00:05:13,752
Do this once a week for flower buds.

27
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:53,380
New flower buds are revived very quickly in this way from flowers that have already withered

28
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:29,442
 weekdays When the cotton pad is dry, you just need to mist it with normal water

29
00:06:29,442 --> 00:06:50,001
This way has created 100 flowers on 1 orchid

30
00:06:52,872 --> 00:06:58,947
Next, you use this water to water your orchid

31
00:06:58,947 --> 00:07:07,778
The nutrient content in cucumber juice will be absorbed through the roots

32
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:16,782
This also improves the permeability and ventilation of the orchid growing medium.

33
00:07:16,782 --> 00:07:24,998
At the same time, it helps to improve the growth of beneficial microorganisms in the orchid growing medium.

34
00:07:24,998 --> 00:07:30,792
Helps protect orchid roots from rotting

35
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:34,552
should do this every 2 weeks.

36
00:07:53,218 --> 00:08:10,176
Next, you also use this water to spray evenly over the entire orchid.

37
00:08:10,176 --> 00:08:18,125
This also only needs to be done once every 2 weeks.

38
00:08:22,231 --> 00:08:36,661
Next, use pieces of cucumber to place on the base of the orchid.

39
00:08:36,661 --> 00:08:48,310
Cucumbers will attract small snails to eat

40
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:54,946
Please book in the afternoon

41
00:08:54,946 --> 00:09:10,982
in the evening and the next morning the snail eats melon, we will catch the snail and leave.

42
00:09:12,336 --> 00:09:17,890
