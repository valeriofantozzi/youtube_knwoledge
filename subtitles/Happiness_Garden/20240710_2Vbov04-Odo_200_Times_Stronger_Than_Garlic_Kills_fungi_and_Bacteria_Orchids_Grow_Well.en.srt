Welcome to my channel

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,071
There are different ways to care for orchids at home,

3
00:00:09,071 --> 00:00:13,454
Today I share a new method for you to have more choices.

4
00:00:15,232 --> 00:00:21,291
This is an aloe plant

5
00:00:26,537 --> 00:00:35,899
Use 1 aloe leaf

6
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:04,522
Add 1 liter of water at room temperature

7
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:13,818
Leave in the dark for 1 day

8
00:02:24,485 --> 00:02:26,485
AFTER 1 DAY

9
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:44,341
You will get red aloe vera juice like this

10
00:03:13,432 --> 00:03:17,414
Use cotton balls

11
00:03:22,756 --> 00:03:30,120
Clean the top and bottom of the orchid leaves

12
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:39,201
Water soaked in aloe vera leaves has many uses

13
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:53,101
Widely used in cosmetic, hair and skin industries

14
00:03:53,101 --> 00:04:05,719
For plants, aloe vera helps kill fungi and bacteria that cause rot very quickly

15
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:12,534
Because in aloe vera contains a high content of natural antibiotics

16
00:04:12,534 --> 00:04:21,652
it's many times better than garlic and antibiotics

17
00:04:24,803 --> 00:04:49,214
Pay attention to thoroughly wipe the underside of the leaves because this place contains many fungi, bacteria and insects

18
00:04:49,214 --> 00:05:05,579
Clean the surface of leaves with aloe vera juice every 2 weeks

19
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:13,805
Helps open stomata on orchid leaves

20
00:05:13,805 --> 00:05:20,718
and kill fungi, bacteria, insects

21
00:05:24,686 --> 00:05:46,856
Watering aloe vera on the entire root and growing medium

22
00:05:46,856 --> 00:06:03,980
Water it like this once a month

23
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:14,893
Aloe vera juice is also a rich source of nutrients for orchids

24
00:06:14,893 --> 00:06:26,981
because aloe vera contains 75 kinds of nutrients including: 20 kinds of minerals, 12 kinds of vitamins, enzymes and antioxidants,

25
00:06:26,981 --> 00:06:49,398
This will stimulate the orchid to sprout and take root very quickly

26
00:06:49,398 --> 00:06:56,267
If you do it regularly, orchid leaves will always be green

27
00:06:56,267 --> 00:07:01,507
If the orchid is healthy, the flowers will also bloom

28
00:07:01,507 --> 00:07:07,833
flowers also last a long time

29
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:19,665
Each year will bloom from 2 to 3 times depending on the orchid variety and the growth of the orchid

30
00:07:19,665 --> 00:07:27,053
The flower color is also more beautiful

31
00:07:29,743 --> 00:07:38,466
flower buds won't fall

32
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:48,120

Welcome to part 2 of the video

35
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:13,869
Orchids are plants with very strong survival ability.

36
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:20,868
Like this orchid, you can see it has withered.

37
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:33,899
Today I will show you how to restore this withered orchid with garlic and turmeric.

38
00:08:36,898 --> 00:09:01,893
First, cut off all damaged roots.

39
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:22,889
Use 1 clove of garlic.

40
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:34,887
add 10g fresh turmeric.

41
00:09:34,887 --> 00:10:00,881
Squeeze garlic and turmeric juice.

42
00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:45,873
Soak the garlic and turmeric juice on the sponge

43
00:10:45,873 --> 00:11:04,869
Put this water in places where orchids can germinate

44
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:19,899
WAIT 30 MINUTES for this water to soak into the orchid

45
00:11:25,898 --> 00:11:35,896
AFTER 30 MINUTES,

46
00:11:35,896 --> 00:12:00,891
Plant with moss to keep moisture well.

47
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:16,888
Put it in a cool place

48
00:12:23,886 --> 00:12:36,884
Every 5 days misting to moisturize 1 time with normal water

49
00:12:44,882 --> 00:12:51,881
AFTER 3 WEEKS

50
00:12:51,881 --> 00:13:16,876
Has grown 1 seedling

51
00:13:33,873 --> 00:14:14,898
AFTER 2 MONTHS

52
00:14:27,895 --> 00:14:56,890
I replanted with pine bark and pumice stone so that the roots of the orchid can be ventilated.

53
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:13,886
Planting like this will be less rotten.

54
00:15:17,885 --> 00:15:33,882
Add some moss on top for better moisturizing.

55
00:15:33,882 --> 00:15:50,879
Water once every 7 days in combination with organic fertilizer as I shared on the channel for orchids to thrive.

56
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:58,877
Hope this sharing content will help you in recovering orchids.

57
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:03,876
Welcome to part 3 of the video

58
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:07,875
There are many types of fertilizers that help orchids thrive.

59
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:11,875
Today I share an organic fertilizer that is recycled from potatoes.

60
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:15,874
It is a very simple but very effective fertilizer for orchids.

61
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:20,873
Because in potatoes, especially in potato sprouts, there is Auxin which is a natural growth hormone.

62
00:16:20,873 --> 00:16:24,872
It helps plants grow strong

63
00:16:24,872 --> 00:16:29,871
and grow many flowers quickly.

64
00:16:29,871 --> 00:16:36,870
As you can see, my orchid has produced a lot of flower buds with this fertilizer.

65
00:16:40,869 --> 00:17:05,897
and the leaves are big and sturdy.

66
00:17:05,897 --> 00:17:14,896
Flowers bloom for a long time.

67
00:17:28,893 --> 00:17:47,889
Don't throw away the potato skins.

68
00:17:47,889 --> 00:17:57,887
I use the peel of a potato

69
00:18:03,886 --> 00:18:12,884
Use the peel of 1 potato.

70
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:24,882
Garlic has antiseptic properties to help eliminate fungus for orchids.

71
00:18:24,882 --> 00:18:39,879
And potatoes contain a lot of starch that helps beneficial microorganisms grow and protect the orchid's roots.

72
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:59,875
Add 1 liter of boiling water.

73
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:05,874
HOLD FOR 24 HOURS.

74
00:19:10,873 --> 00:19:18,871
AFTER 24 HOURS.

75
00:19:45,899 --> 00:19:57,897
Water this water on the orchid growing medium.

76
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:14,893
Apply 1-2 times a month.

77
00:20:14,893 --> 00:20:31,890
And fertilize alternately with other organic fertilizers for healthy growth and balance of nutrients.

78
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:42,888
Potatoes, garlic contain many minerals such as potassium, phosphorus, calcium, 

79
00:20:42,888 --> 00:20:51,886
and magnesium, which naturally help orchids absorb easily.

80
00:20:51,886 --> 00:21:03,884
This method is very simple but has provided all the necessary nutrients for orchids.

81
00:21:03,884 --> 00:21:12,882
Try this method and feel the results after 3 uses.

82
00:21:12,882 --> 00:21:24,879
I believe you will be surprised at its effectiveness.

83
00:21:24,879 --> 00:21:35,877
Hope this simple way will help you take better care of your orchid at home.
