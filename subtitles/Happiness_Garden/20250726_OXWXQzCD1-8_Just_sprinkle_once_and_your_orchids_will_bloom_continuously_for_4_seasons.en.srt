Hello orchid lovers. Welcome to the

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,960
happiness garden channel.

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,040
Today I will show you how to make

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,440
natural fertilizer that is both simple

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,440
and effective.

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,039
This fertilizer will help your orchids

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,360
grow sustainably and bloom for a longer

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:30,880

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,679
Now, let's get started.

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,440
This orchid has finished blooming. If

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,079
not properly cared for, the plant can

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,000
become stunted and grow slowly. So,

14
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,000
post-flowering care is very important to

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,800
help the plant recover and prepare for

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,800
the next blooming cycle.

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,440
First remove all damaged, rotting or

19
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,440
dried roots.

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:12,560
[Music]

21
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,400
This will allow the orchid to focus its

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,400
energy on healthy parts for growth.

23
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,720
This process also helps stimulate the

24
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,450
plant to grow new roots and prepares it

25
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:37,900
for the next growth cycle.

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,759
After removing damaged roots, we will

28

proceed to cut off all unhealthy leaves.

30
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,320
Next, cut off the old flower stems so

31
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,190
the plant can focus its energy on

32
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:06,000

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,920
Old flower stems usually no longer have

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,360
the ability to grow and can cause the

36
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,360
plant to waste energy if left attached.

37
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,239
Sprinkle a layer of cinnamon powder onto

38
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,239
the cut areas to disinfect and prevent

39
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,239
infection.

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,920
Now take one spoonful of cinnamon powder

46
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,590
and add it to a jar to prepare a natural

196
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,519
I will continue to water this natural

197
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,079
fertilizer mixture on the plant every 10

198
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:19,079
days to ensure the orchid grows

199
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,079
sustainably.

[Music]

201
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,920
On regular days, if the potting medium

202
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,920
is dry or the environment is too dry,

203
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:36,279
you should simply water or mist lightly

204
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,279
to maintain humidity for the orchid.

205
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,010
[Music]

206
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,320
After that, remember to place the pot in

207
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,820
a spot with gentle sunlight to allow the

208
00:14:48,320 --> 00:15:03,680
orchid to photosynthesize effectively.

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:14,880

212
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,760
You can see that the new leaves have

213
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,760
grown longer and are healthy.

00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,619
[Music]

215
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And two new flower stocks have emerged,

216
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,240
promising another vibrant blooming

217
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,240
season ahead.

218
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:46,700
[Music]

219
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,000
Uh the leaves have become stronger and

220
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,079
grown exceptionally well after being

221
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,079
cared for with this natural fertilizer

222
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,079
mixture.

223
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,000
Uh the roots have grown out of the

224
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,710
orchid pot which is a sign that the

225
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:21,359
orchid is growing very vigorously.

228
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,199
And this is the result. After 90 days of

229
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,959
recovery from a pot of orchid that had

230
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,279
finished blooming, the plant has revived

231
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,519
strongly and is now growing two new

232
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,519
vibrant flower spikes. This is a

233
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,839
welldeserved reward for patience and

234
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,839
daily care.

[Music]

236
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,839
Because it was properly cared for, the

237
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,079
plant's root system has grown strong and

238
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,919
produced many new roots. These roots

239
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,160
will continue to spread, anchoring

240
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,079
firmly into the growing medium, creating

241
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,480
a solid foundation to nourish the

242
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,650
blooming and soonto bloom flowers on the

243
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:20,959
spike.

244
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:22,400
[Music]

245
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,000
The roots are considered the heart of

246
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,240
the orchid because they are the first

247
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,480
part to absorb water and nutrients from

248
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,880
the environment such as fertilizer and

249
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,000
moisture in in the growing medium

250
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,160
helping to sustain the entire plant. If

251
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,480
the roots are weak or damaged, the plant

252
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,280
will lack nutrients leading to yellowing

253
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:44,280
leaves, rotting crown, and inability to

254
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,280
bloom.

256
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,760
What do you think about the way I

257
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,320
revived this orchid after it finished

258
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,160
blooming? Don't hesitate to leave a

259
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,919

260
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,919

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,919

Thanks to the healthy root system, the

264
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,600
plant not only blooms regularly, but

265
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,360
also develops lush, thick green leaves,

266
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,760
a sign that the orchid is in its best

267
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,760
growing condition.

And the most wonderful result is the new

270
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,039
flower buds slowly beginning to open,

271
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,440
promising a brilliant and long-lasting

272
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,440
blooming season.

273
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,200
Each flower bud is like a small gift

274
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,039
from nature, signaling that the plant is

275
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,120
full of vitality.

276
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,760
When properly cared for, the flowers not

277
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,600
only bloom evenly, but also retain their

278
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:47,960
vibrant color and last longer,

279
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,960
brightening up the space around you.

280
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,480
Every small step of progress from the

281
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,400
plant is the result of devoted care. As

282
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,200
long as you are patient, any orchid will

283
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,600
respond with its own unique beauty.

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,160
This is why monitoring the condition of

286
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,400
the roots is always important. Uh, when

287
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,559
the roots are healthy, every other part

288
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,400
of the plant will naturally enter a

289
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:16,720
harmonious growth cycle.
