00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,239
is an excellent natural fertilizer for

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,800
effective photosynthesis.

194
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,160
In addition, drying the leaves helps

195
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,480
reduce the risk of pests developing on

196
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,480
wet surfaces, keeping the orchids

197
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,100
healthy and ready to absorb nutrients

198
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:45,839
from other care methods.

200
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,399
Then place the orchid pot in a spot with

201
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,399
gentle sunlight.

202
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,000
No matter how good the fertilizer is, if

203
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,080
the plant lacks light, it will struggle

204
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,080
to synthesize nutrients and bloom

205
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,080
brilliantly.

207
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,080
And here are the results after 3 weeks

208
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,760
of care.

209
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,480
You can see the orchid leaves becoming

210
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:18,839
lush, green, and glossy. A sign of a

211
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,839
plant being properly cared for.

00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:24,320
[Music]

213
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,560
Uh these lush green leaves are not only

214
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,640
visually appealing but also act as a

215
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,800
natural shield helping the orchids

216
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,800
resist pests and harsh environmental

217
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,800
conditions.

218
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,120
And when the leaves are healthy and

219
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,279
shiny, you will see the entire orchid

220
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,680
full of vitality, ready for the next

221
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,680
vibrant blooms.

222
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:02,240
You can see new roots growing strong,

223
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,000
smooth, and white, spreading evenly,

224
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,680
indicating that the orchid is absorbing

225
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,680
nutrients optimally from the growing

226
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,680
medium.

227
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,800
The old roots also grow densely,

228
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,360
anchoring firmly into the growing

229
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,680
medium, creating a solid foundation for

230
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,730
the orchid to continue thriving and

231
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:34,240
bloom brilliantly.

233
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,200
You will see vibrant flowers blooming on

234
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,880
the stems for a long time, spreading

235
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,519
their colors and bringing complete

236
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,519
beauty to the orchid.

237
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,079
Um the flowers not only bloom for long

238
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,399
for a long time but also keep their

239
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,260
bright colors bringing lasting beauty to

240
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,560
the entire space.

Admiring the vibrant longlasting blooms

243
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,440
will fill you with inspiration to keep
