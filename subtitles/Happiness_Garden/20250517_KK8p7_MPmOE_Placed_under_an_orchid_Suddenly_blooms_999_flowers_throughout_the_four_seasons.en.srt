00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,799
Welcome to my little charming garden

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,799
where simple things become truly

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,320
special. In this video, I continue

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,320
sharing how to revive orchids that have

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,980
finished blooming so they can bloom

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,119
again in the next flowering season.

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,439
[Music]

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,720
The method is very simple using natural

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,160
fertilizer available in every

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,160
kitchen and your orchid will grow

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,880
strong, bloom all year round, decorating

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,880
your home more

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,559
brilliantly. Now, let's get started. You

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,960
can see this is an orchid with many

15
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,719
flower stems growing on the same plant

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,600
and they are beginning to enter the

17
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,239
fading flower stage.

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,800
Every time the orchid blooms, it focuses

19
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,559
energy on the flowers. Therefore, after

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,160
the flowers fade, the plant is usually

21
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:56,559
very weak. If not carefully cared for,

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,440
the orchid will become stunted and may

23
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,800
even die. But don't worry, because with

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,559
this simple method, you can help the

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,559
plant recover quickly and become healthy

26
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,280
again. The buds that have bloomed will

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,520
not bloom again. So, let's cut them off

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,159
so the plant can focus on nurturing new

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,159
buds.

30
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:42,040
Uh these are the flower buds that have

31
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,040
bloomed and it need to be cut off.

39
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,840
Then check the roots and growing medium

40
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,840
for signs of damage or

41
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,440

you along for the journey.

46
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,760
You can see this growing medium squeezes

47
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,280
out a lot of water which makes the

48
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,280
orchid roots prone to water logging.

49
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,599
Therefore, we need to remove this moss

50
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,519
con's growing medium to prevent root rot

51
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:13,120
and help the plant grow

52
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:15,040
better. Then cut off all the damaged and

53
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,959
waterlogged roots to prevent the orchid

54
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,440
from getting infected and to encourage

55
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,440
new root growth.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,799
You can see that moss as a growing

57
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,400
medium retains water very well. If the

58
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,560
watering amount is not properly

59
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:47,239
controlled, the orchid roots will easily

60
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,239
become water logged and rot a lot.

61
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,959
Then we rinse thoroughly, especially the

62
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,560
roots and base of the plant, with wath

63
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,000
water to completely remove the old

64
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,000
growing medium and any remaining

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
pathogens.

[Music]

67
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,960
For the old pine bark medium, I wash it

68
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:47,160
thoroughly with water, then treat it for

69
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,160
fungi before reusing it.

70
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,320
This helps eliminate pathogens, save

71
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,320
costs, and protect the

72
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,660
[Applause]

73
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:19,120
environment. Then let the growing medium

74
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,120
drain before proceeding with

75
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,520
sterilization. Then you take an onion to

76
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,280
make natural fertilizer, which helps

77
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,160
sterilize and stimulate root growth for

78
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,160
the orchid.

79
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,880
use onion skins to make natural

80
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,479
fertilizer because they contain many

81
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,479
nutrients and minerals beneficial for

82
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,479
orchids.

release nutrients into the water when

86
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,800
making fertilizer.

87
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,840
Put the onion skins into a jar. Then

88
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,840
pour.5 L of boiling water

89
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:20,039
in. Cover the jar and wait for the water

90
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,039
to cool before using it.

water through a sie to remove the skins

94
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,350

Now, soak the orchid roots in this

101
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,480
solution for about 20 minutes to help

102
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,480
sterilize and stimulate root

103
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:13,120
growth. Onions contain natural sulfur

104
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,360
compounds that help sterilize and are

105
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,730
rich in antioxidants that stimulate

106
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,960
faster root growth.

take a soft cloth soaked with this

110

113
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,399
nutrient absorption.

[Music]

115
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,399
Wiping the leaves not only cleans the

116
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,880
leaf surface but also helps remove dust

117
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,680
and some some harmful bacteria making

118
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,680
the orchid leaves

119
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,480
healthier. Um the nutrients in the onion

120
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,959
solution help the orchid leaves become

121
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,040
shinier thereby improving photosynthesis

122
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:08,040

While waiting for the roots to soak, we

125
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,640
proceed to treat the old growing medium

126
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,640
for fungi before reusing it for planting

127
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:30,399
orchids. Pouring boiling water onto the

128
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,920
growing medium helps kill bacteria and

129
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,920
fungi and cleanse the medium before

130
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,920

00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:25,440
sterilized. Then we take the growing

140
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,440
medium out for orchid planting. Note, if

141
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,519
the medium is still hot, soak it in cold

142
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,400

drainage holes to prevent root water

148

To prevent the plant from shaking during

162
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,839
rod as a support for the orchid, helping

163
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,839
keep the plant stable and secure.

164
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,800
To stimulate new flower growth, I use

165
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,040
some grapes because they contain

166
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,120
antioxidants and natural hormones that

167
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,120

169
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,079
Uh take three grapes and 0.5 L of water.

170
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,880
Then blend them to make natural

171
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,880
fertilizer for the orchid.

172
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,720
After that, make sure to strain out the

173
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,399

174
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,399
smooth and easier for the plant to

175
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,399

quickly, enhance photosynthesis, and

193
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,280
grow

194
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:14,720
steadily. After 1 month, you can see the

195
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,400
roots growing very healthy. Uh a sign

196
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,600
that the plant is recovering well and

197
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,600
ready for the new flowering

199
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,000
period. These new roots will help the

200
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,320
orchid absorb nutrients and water more

201
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,120
effectively, thereby growing strong and

202
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,120
blooming more beautifully.

204
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:09,480
You can also see new flower spikes

205
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,480
budding on the orchid plant.

206
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,160
This proves that the orchid is

207
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,480
recovering well and preparing for a for

208
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:39,529
a brilliant upcoming flowering season.

210
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,640
With this simple method, using

211
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,200
ingredients readily available in the

212
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,600
kitchen, we can completely take care of

213
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,919
orchids at home, helping them bloom all

214
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,919
year round.

218
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,440
What do you think about my method for

219
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,960
restoring weak orchids? Please leave

220
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,600

221
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,600

223
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,120
Just by restoring one orchid at a time,

224
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,760
you will be surprised to have a vibrant

225
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:03,200
orchid garden full of flowers, bringing
