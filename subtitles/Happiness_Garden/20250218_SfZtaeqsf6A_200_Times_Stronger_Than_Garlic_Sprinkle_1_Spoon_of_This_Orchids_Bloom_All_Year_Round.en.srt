they can be stimulated to grow and

38
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,600
produce new

40
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,840
prevent fungal infections and create

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,840
space for new roots to

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,599
grow next trim the damaged Roots cutting

43
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,440

44
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,159
to focus its nutrients on the healthy

45
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,159

55
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,799
