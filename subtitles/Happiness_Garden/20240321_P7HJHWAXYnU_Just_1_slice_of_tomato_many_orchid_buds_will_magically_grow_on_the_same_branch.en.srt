1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,033
I'm so glad you came to my channel

2
00:00:05,033 --> 00:00:12,898
If you have an orchid, make sure you want it to bloom for a long time

3
00:00:12,898 --> 00:00:18,597
so many flowers bloom all year round

4
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:26,595
Now I will show you what is the best fertilizer for orchids.

5
00:00:26,962 --> 00:00:33,894
If you follow us till the end of this video,

6
00:00:33,894 --> 00:00:39,222
you will learn how to make orchids bloom all year round.

7
00:00:39,222 --> 00:00:42,192
Now get on with it

8
00:00:42,192 --> 00:00:48,934
When the flowers have all bloomed

9
00:00:48,934 --> 00:00:59,695
I cut off all the places that are no longer able to flower.

10
00:01:13,842 --> 00:01:23,817
Then sprinkle white cement on the cut

11
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:30,706
and let the cut dry naturally

12
00:01:30,706 --> 00:01:38,324
White cement helps disinfect and heal cuts quickly

13
00:01:42,245 --> 00:01:50,212
A location like this will have the potential for budding or flower buds

14
00:01:53,441 --> 00:02:03,409
I peel off the protective film that will make it easier to germinate

15
00:02:06,548 --> 00:02:08,548
Using Tomatoes

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,540
Use 1 slice of tomato like this

17
00:02:16,779 --> 00:02:21,758
Tomatoes contain a lot of Vitamin A,

18
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:30,070
vitamin C and rich in Potassium, Calcium, Phosphorus

19
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:38,636
When orchids are cared for with tomatoes, they will grow very quickly

20
00:02:53,308 --> 00:03:05,095
Puree tomatoes in 300ml of water

21
00:03:13,148 --> 00:03:22,102
Then filter the water

22
00:03:32,335 --> 00:03:40,516
I add water to get 1 liter of tomato juice

23
00:03:41,286 --> 00:03:43,256
Method 1

24
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:49,607
I use cotton pads soaked in tomato juice

25
00:03:51,951 --> 00:04:08,485
i put it here

26
00:04:08,485 --> 00:04:19,546
You should do it every 7 days to help keep these buds moist

27
00:04:35,722 --> 00:04:43,130
for the flower top when it's still green like this

28
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:48,213
you still use this water we put it here

29
00:04:48,213 --> 00:04:57,489
to maintain moisture for the flower spike and the flower top is very quickly revived

30
00:04:57,489 --> 00:05:07,465
On normal days, you only use water to keep the flower branches moist

31
00:05:07,465 --> 00:05:10,417
Way 2

32
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:24,453
You use this water we take care of the leaves will always be green

33
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:38,962
and healthy, because tomatoes have very good antioxidant

34
00:05:39,386 --> 00:05:44,585
and antibacterial properties

35
00:05:49,448 --> 00:05:58,437
please apply this every two weeks to the tree

36
00:06:11,776 --> 00:06:19,759
The leaves after being taken care of will be green and healthy like this

37
00:06:22,588 --> 00:06:25,558
Way 3

38
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:38,442
You can also use this tomato juice to spray on the top and bottom of the leaves

39
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:46,953
and spray evenly on the root

40
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,150
Way 4

41
00:06:54,150 --> 00:07:01,037
Use this water to water the orchid once every 2 weeks

42
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:11,282
Orchids grow because nutrients are transported from the roots to all parts of the orchid

43
00:07:12,315 --> 00:07:22,313
Before fertilizing, it is necessary to water a sufficient amount of moisture first

44
00:07:22,313 --> 00:07:30,487
This will help the plant absorb the fertilizer better

45
00:07:42,932 --> 00:07:44,932
Result

46
00:07:46,718 --> 00:07:51,707
And with this simple way,

47
00:07:51,707 --> 00:08:06,393
the regenerated flower branches will be very big and fat

48
00:08:08,453 --> 00:08:16,892
This way I also get a seedling orchid

49
00:08:18,736 --> 00:08:26,600
This way also helps flower buds to be big and healthy

50
00:08:36,332 --> 00:08:46,896
so many flower buds are reborn in this way

51
00:08:47,896 --> 00:08:56,894
So my house always has flowers blooming all year round.

52
00:09:03,893 --> 00:09:08,892
If you want orchids to bloom more,

53
00:09:09,892 --> 00:09:16,890
The flowers bloom for a long time on the branches before fading

54
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:23,889
brilliant flower color.

55
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:28,888
Like my orchid,

56
00:09:28,888 --> 00:09:34,887
Flowering can last up to 6 months.

57
00:09:35,887 --> 00:09:41,885
Flowers bloom all year round, one after another.

58
00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:48,884
There are always many flowers growing on the same branch.

59
00:09:48,884 --> 00:09:54,883
If you want that, do the following:

60
00:09:55,883 --> 00:10:02,881
1. Place the orchid pot in a place with light sunlight.

61
00:10:03,881 --> 00:10:09,880
Or leave it on the windowsill.

62
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:19,878
Avoid the sun and strong wind

63
00:10:20,878 --> 00:10:29,876
2. Before fertilizing, water the orchid.

64
00:10:31,876 --> 00:10:42,873
This will make it easier for the roots to absorb nutrients from the fertilizer.

65
00:10:44,873 --> 00:10:52,871
Every time you water you can,

66
00:10:54,871 --> 00:11:02,869
Soak orchid roots in water for 30 minutes to absorb enough water.

67
00:11:05,869 --> 00:11:13,867
For leaves you use spray,

68
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:22,865
Spray to wet leaves with water to help open stomata.

69
00:11:24,865 --> 00:11:33,863
After soaking for 30 minutes the roots absorb enough water will turn green like this.

70
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:45,861
We took it out and waited 30 minutes before fertilizing.

71
00:11:55,859 --> 00:12:05,857
3. Use lemon as an organic fertilizer for orchids.

72
00:12:06,857 --> 00:12:15,855
Use the remaining juice of half a lemon.

73
00:12:21,854 --> 00:12:32,852
Mix lemon juice in 3 liters of water

74
00:12:43,849 --> 00:12:53,847
Pour the lemon juice mixture into a spray bottle

75
00:12:56,847 --> 00:13:05,845
Then spray evenly on the top and bottom of the leaves

76
00:13:06,845 --> 00:13:15,843
Lemon juice is packed with nutrients like vitamin C, citric acid, potassium, and magnesium,

77
00:13:17,843 --> 00:13:27,841
These substances are quickly absorbed through the leaves of the orchid,

78
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:38,839
helping to provide the nutrients needed to promote the health and growth of the plant.

79
00:13:41,838 --> 00:13:51,836
After spraying, use cotton to dry the leaves

80
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:31,861
Pay attention to drying the leaf buds

81
00:14:34,861 --> 00:14:45,859
Regular application of orchid leaves will always be green like this,

82
00:14:45,859 --> 00:14:55,857
Leaves are not infected with fungal diseases.

83
00:15:00,856 --> 00:15:12,853
4. Add 1 teaspoon of honey to the lemon juice solution earlier

84
00:15:24,851 --> 00:15:34,849
Water this solution for orchid roots 1-2 times/month

85
00:15:35,849 --> 00:15:43,847
 Honey has the ability to stimulate growth and cell division in plants.

86
00:15:44,847 --> 00:15:54,845
When using honey mixed with lemon juice as a fertilizer,

87
00:15:55,845 --> 00:16:05,843
it will help the plant thrive, produce many new shoots, beautiful petals.

88
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:15,841
Honey has antibacterial and antifungal properties,

89
00:16:16,841 --> 00:16:26,839
help orchids better disease resistance.

90
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:36,837
When using honey mixed with lemon juice as fertilizer,

91
00:16:37,837 --> 00:16:46,835
it also helps orchids have bright colors, sweet fragrance and prolong the life of flowers.

92
00:16:48,834 --> 00:16:54,866
You can also soak in this water for 30 minutes,

93
00:16:54,866 --> 00:16:59,866
Let the roots absorb the most nutrients.
