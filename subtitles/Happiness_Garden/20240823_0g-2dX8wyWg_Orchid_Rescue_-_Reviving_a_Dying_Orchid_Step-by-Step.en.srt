Welcome to my channel.

00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:12,898
In this video, I share how to fertilize to help rot-affected orchids continue to revive and bloom strongly.

00:00:41,052 --> 00:00:50,890
When growing many orchids, orchid rot cannot be avoided.

5
00:00:57,162 --> 00:01:06,887
When orchids rot like this, cut off all rotten leaves as soon as possible.

6
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:19,885
This will help prevent rot from spreading into the stem, killing the orchid.

7
00:02:06,775 --> 00:02:16,873
Then sprinkle cinnamon powder on the cut to help the wound heal quickly.

8
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:39,869
and sprinkle on the surface of orchid pots to help limit the spread of rot to the roots.

9
00:02:58,335 --> 00:03:08,896
Then leave it for 1 day without watering to let the cut heal completely.

10
00:03:22,427 --> 00:03:32,892
While waiting for the cut to heal, I took a thinly sliced ​​green banana.

11
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:46,889
Green bananas contain many minerals and nutrients such as potassium, phosphorus,

12
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:56,887
and nitrogen, which helps provide nutrition for orchids.

13
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:20,882
Add 1 liter of water.

14
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:34,879
Then add 3 tablespoons of rice.

15
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:44,877
Rice helps absorb some pollutants and improves environmental quality for orchids.

16
00:04:51,380 --> 00:05:01,874
and add 1 teaspoon of trichoderma and Bacillus spores.

17
00:05:06,844 --> 00:05:16,871
It will produce many beneficial microorganisms that help protect orchids very well.

18
00:05:29,631 --> 00:05:39,900
Wait 1 day before using.

19
00:05:50,098 --> 00:05:53,897
1 DAY LATER.

20
00:05:56,865 --> 00:06:06,894
Decant the clear water above for use.

21
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:31,934
I add water to this residue to reuse after 1 week.

22
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:43,887
I add water in a 1/1 ratio.

23
00:06:50,306 --> 00:07:00,884
From now on, water your orchids with this mixture once a week.

24
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:15,881
Green bananas help provide organic matter and increase water retention.

25
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:27,648
Rice helps provide organic matter and improve environmental quality for orchids very well.

26
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:50,874
Then spray this water on the leaves to supplement nutrients through the leaves for the orchid.

27
00:07:50,874 --> 00:07:59,872
Helps leaves stay green and increases resistance to pests

28
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:16,253
Then place it on the windowsill or under a sun filter.

29
00:08:25,653 --> 00:08:28,900
1 MONTH LATER.

30
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:42,897
The rotten orchid is now healthy and has many buds.

31
00:08:52,862 --> 00:08:57,894
Leaves are stronger than before.

32
00:09:00,575 --> 00:09:10,891
Continue watering this once a week.

33
00:09:20,635 --> 00:09:30,887
and continue to spray this water once a week on the leaves.

34
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,880
AFTER NEXT 1 MONTH.

35
00:10:10,756 --> 00:10:20,878
The rotten orchid has recovered and many flower branches have grown.

36
00:10:26,003 --> 00:10:35,875
Leaves are greener and healthier.

37
00:10:41,898 --> 00:10:51,871
Up to 6 flower stems develop at the same time.

38
00:10:55,953 --> 00:11:05,869
Hopefully the video will help you a lot in taking better care of orchids at home.
