1 MONTH LATER

15
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:22,069

00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:16,425
Use GE ginger water to water orchids

34
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:22,340
Yeast brewed from fresh ginger has the effect of stimulating sprouting,

35
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:28,571
strong rooting, repelling insects, killing fungi, stimulating buds, and stimulating growth.

36
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,553
GE ginger also helps orchids increase their ability to absorb nutrients from the fertilizer you fertilize them.

37
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,794
Only do this 1-2 times a month

These roots will help the orchid absorb nutrients more easily and more

42
00:06:08,165 --> 00:06:15,317
Orchids grow well or not thanks to the photosynthesis of roots and leaves

43
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:57,341
when the orchid is healthy, after the orchid branch blooms the last flowers,

44
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:07,715
