00:00:19,969 --> 00:00:23,962
Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:25,895 --> 00:00:35,893
If you have an orchid and you plant it forever but it still hasn't bloomed.

3
00:00:35,893 --> 00:00:43,009
Like my orchid, it hasn't bloomed yet.

4
00:00:44,986 --> 00:00:54,956
The tree is weak and its roots are severely damaged.

5
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:16,885
Remove old planting material and cut off all damaged roots.

6
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:59,344
Then rinse with water

7
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:32,870
Using a small aloe vera leaf contains a lot of gel which is very good for the orchid to recover.

8
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:50,900
Aloe vera also has antiseptic properties that help prevent orchids from rotting roots and leaves.

9
00:02:54,899 --> 00:03:03,897
Add 2 liters of water.

10
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:26,893
Add 1 teaspoon of honey which has antiseptic properties and is very nutritious for orchids to grow

11
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:48,888
Leave for 1 hour for nutrients to completely dissolve in water

12
00:03:51,888 --> 00:03:55,887
1 Hour later

13
00:03:59,193 --> 00:04:09,884
Use this water to thoroughly wipe the top and bottom of the leaves

14
00:04:17,017 --> 00:04:26,014
Helps eliminate fungi and bacteria that cause orchid diseases

15
00:04:27,696 --> 00:04:34,646
Then soak the entire orchid in this water for 30 minutes

16
00:04:34,646 --> 00:04:42,539
Helps stimulate rooting and quick recovery

17
00:04:52,120 --> 00:05:02,107
Now I recycle plastic bottles into orchid pots that don't need watering

18
00:05:07,982 --> 00:05:17,971
With this growing method, you will not need to water and the orchid will not dry out and grow very well

19
00:06:33,206 --> 00:06:43,187
Then plant the orchid in this pot with pine bark to keep the roots well ventilated

20
00:06:51,312 --> 00:06:59,284
Add some moss on top to keep it moist.

21
00:07:05,697 --> 00:07:12,681
Water the orchids.

22
00:07:24,615 --> 00:07:34,877
The water level in this location will never dry up, so orchid roots are always kept moist

23
00:07:34,877 --> 00:07:40,755
Therefore, orchid roots will take root very quickly.

24
00:07:40,755 --> 00:07:47,001
Place the orchid pot in a cool and well-lit place.

25
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:55,873
3 Weeks later

26
00:07:58,023 --> 00:08:06,004
Roots grow very healthy.

27
00:08:08,485 --> 00:08:18,474
When the roots grow healthy like this, you need to use organic foliar fertilizer such as:

28
00:08:18,474 --> 00:08:27,505
Rice water, soy water, honey water, fish protein... as I shared

29
00:08:27,505 --> 00:08:33,032
Apply every 2 weeks to orchids.

30
00:08:34,403 --> 00:08:38,898
3 Months Later

31
00:08:41,446 --> 00:08:51,429
The orchids I applied this method grew healthily and bloomed many flowers

32
00:08:55,407 --> 00:09:03,393
The roots grow very healthy, helping the orchid absorb many nutrients

33
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:10,729
The leaves are sturdy and very resistant to pests.

34
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:23,622
The flowers bloom brightly and stay on the branches for a long time before fading.

35
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:39,886
The flowers stay on the branches for up to 6 months before falling.

36
00:09:42,885 --> 00:09:50,884
I have created video subtitles in many different languages ​​so you can choose the appropriate language
