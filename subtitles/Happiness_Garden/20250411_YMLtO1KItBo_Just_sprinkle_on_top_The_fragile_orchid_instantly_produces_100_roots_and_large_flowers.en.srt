00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,439
Welcome to the happiness

3
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:11,120
garden to help weak orchids recover and

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,880
grow stronger. Today I will continue

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,880
sharing how to make natural fertilizer

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,200
and how to care for the plant to support

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,200
fast

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:23,880
recovery. To restore it, first check and

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,880
remove all the damaged leaves.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,720
Diseased leaves can be a source of

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,480
spreading fungi, bacteria, or viruses to

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,120
other parts of the plant or to nearby

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,710
plants. Timely removal helps control the

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,520
disease from the

15
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:40,800
[Music]

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,960
beginning. Rotten leaves often

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,200
accumulate water and create an ideal

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,039
environment for bacteria and fungi to

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,039
grow.

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,120
Uh removing them helps keep the base of

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,440
the plant well ventilated, preventing

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,079
prolonged moisture that can cause root

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,600
and stem

24
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,359
rot. Additionally, once the removal is

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,520
done, the plant will look neater,

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,960
cleaner, and healthier without the

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,960
presence of yellowing or decaying

28
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:10,400
leaves. Next, we check the growing

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,520
medium and the roots to see if they are

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,520
the cause of the orchid rot.

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,080
Uh use your fingers to gently squeeze

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,080
the roots. If the root is firm, it is

33
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,720
still fresh. But if it is soft, it has

34
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,720
already

35
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,569
[Music]

36
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,799
rotted. Then cut off all the damaged

37
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,799
roots.

38
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,840
Rotten roots are often breeding grounds

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,680
for bacteria or fungi. If not removed,

40
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,759
the rot can quickly spread to healthy

41
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,399
roots, weakening the plant or even

42
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,399
causing it to

43
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,399
[Music]

44
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:02,320
die. When the damaged roots are removed,

45
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,680
the plant will sense the need to grow

46
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,840
new roots to absorb water and nutrients.

47
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:12,000
As a result, the plant will push out new

48
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,000
root shoots more quickly and more

49
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,920
vigorously. If you haven't subscribed to

[Music]

55
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,680
journey. Do you have any

56
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,040
oranges? Now I will grate the orange

57
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,360
peel to make fertilizer to help restore

58
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,360
weak

59
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,120
orchids. Orange peel contains essential

60
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,280
oils and lemonine which have

61
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,920
antibacterial properties and can inhibit

62
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:54,599
mold growth. These are the main culprits

63
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,599
causing root and stem rot in orchids.

64
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:02,720
[Music]

65
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,800
Orange peel is rich in vitamin C and

66
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,640
antioxidants, which can help boost the

67
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,640
plant's resistance, repair damaged

68
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,879
cells, and promote the regeneration of

69
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,879
new

70
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,080
roots. After grating, I put the orange

71
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,330
peel into a blender and add about 300 ml

72
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,479
of water.

73
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,479
[Music]

74
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,760
Then blend it finely in the water.

75
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,840
[Applause]

76
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,840
Let me know in the comments which

77
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,519
country you're watching from. It's

78
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,400
wonderful that we can connect and chat

79
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,400
from all around the world.

80
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,440
After blending the orange peel with

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,440
water, straining out the residue is a

82
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,120
very important step. It makes the

83
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,120
mixture more pure and safer for the

84
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,120
orchid.

85
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,240
If the orange peel residue is left

86
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,479
behind, it can stick to the roots or the

87
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,600
base of the plant, causing blockage and

88
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:40,639
retaining moisture for too long, easily

89
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,639
leading to rot

90
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,160
again. After straining out the residue,

91
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,880
dilute the orange peel solution with one

92
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,880
liter of clean water to create a mixture

93
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:55,080
with a safe and suitable concentration

94
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,080
for helping the orchid recover.

95
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,880
Then add 1 teaspoon of baking

96
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,960
soda. Uh, baking soda has a mild

97
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,720
alkaline property that helps neutralize

98
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,720
the acidic environment caused by fungal

99
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,720
diseases.

100
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,199
When combined with the natural essential

101
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,199
oils from orange peel, the mixture

102
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,919
becomes more powerful in eliminating

103
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,919
fungi and bacteria.

104
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,840
After mixing the diluted orange peel

105
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,600
solution with baking soda, the first

106
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,919
step you should take is to use a soft

107
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,320
cloth to soak up the mixture and

108
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:58,039
carefully wipe both the upper and lower

109
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,039
surfaces of the leaves.

110
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,240
This gentle antibacterial mixture will

111
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,639
kill bacteria and fungi on the leaves

112
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,400
without harming the leaf tissue, helping

113
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,400
the leaves become healthier and

114
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:28,160
shinier. When the leaves are clean, the

115
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,240
plant absorbs light more effectively,

116
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,960
helping it recover faster and grow

117
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,960
stronger after

118
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,000
[Music]

119
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:48,560
rotting. Additionally, orchid leaves may

120
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,039
harbor fungi, bacteria, or pests hiding

121
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,639
on the underside. Wiping the leaves

122
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,039
helps clean the surface and prevents the

123
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,039
spread of

124
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:14,000
diseases. Then place the orchid pot into

125
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,080
a basin and pour the mixture over the

126
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,960
roots, making sure they are thoroughly

127
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,880
soaked.

128
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,960
This makes it easier for you to pour the

129
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,960
mixture and ensures the roots are evenly

130
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,639
soaked. Make sure all the roots,

131
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,960
especially the base, are fully submerged

132
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:40,120
in the solution. This is the area most

133
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,120
vulnerable to fungal and rot attacks.

134
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,360
This is the ideal time for the active

135
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,440
compounds in the orange peel and baking

136
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,800
soda to take effect, eliminating

137
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,800
pathogens and cleaning the

138
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,610
[Music]

139
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:14,240
roots. After pouring, soak the orchid

140
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,240
pot in this mixture for about 20

141
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,599
minutes. Then we prepare fertilizer for

142
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:29,720
the orchid to stimulate the growth of

143
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,720
new roots and new shoots.

144
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,640
To make the recovery fertilizer, I take

145
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,640
3 tablespoons of

146
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,179
[Music]

147
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:52,839
oats. Then add it to one liter of water.

148
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,639
[Music]

149
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,920
Then cover it and wait for 20 minutes to

150
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,720
allow the nutrients from the oats to

151
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,720
dissolve into the

152
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:16,390
[Music]

153
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:22,600
water. Then proceed to strain out the

154
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,600
oat residue.

155
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,940
[Music]

156
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,200
Use a fine strainer or clean cloth to

157
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,459
filter out the oat water.

158
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,459
[Music]

159
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,959
Discard the oat pulp and keep only the

160
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,800
clear liquid. This is the part rich in

161
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,800
nutrients that the roots can absorb most

162
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:08,160
[Music]

163
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,240
easily. The next ingredient I need is

164
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,320
vitamin B1 which is excellent for

165
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,560
stimulating root growth and new shoots

166
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,560
in orchids.

167
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,200
Vitamin B1 thamine plays a role in

168
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,880
activating enzymes that help the plant

169
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,360
increase cell production at the root

170
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,430
tips, thereby promoting faster growth of

171
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,140

174
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:41,200
roots. Add three tablets of vitamin B1

175
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,959
into the container and stir well until

176
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,760
they are completely dissolved in the

177
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,760
water.

178
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,389
[Music]

179
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,490
[Music]

180
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,800
After soaking for 20 minutes, remember

181
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,800
to take the orchid pot out.

182
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,800
The water used to soak the orchid should

183
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:25,480
be discarded and not reused as it may

184
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,480
contain harmful fungi or pathogens.

185
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,360
Step two, use a soft cloth to soak up

186
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,800
the oatmeal and B1 mixture. Then

187
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,800
carefully wipe the orchid

188
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,720
leaves. Orchid leaves can absorb

189
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,040
nutrients through the epidermis,

190
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:59,720
especially easily absorb substances like

191
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,720
vitamins and sugars from oatmeal.

192
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,600
[Music]

193
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,920
Orchid leaves can absorb nutrients

194
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,160
through the epidermis, especially easily

195
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,959
absorbed substances like vitamins and

196
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,959
sugars from

197
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,600
oatmeal. Clean leaves help the plant

198
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,279
photosynthesize better, increasing its

199
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,959
ability to produce nutrients to nourish

200
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,480
the roots and new

201
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:28,160
shoots. Uh, after wiping the leaves, we

202
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,560
water this mixture onto the orchid

203
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,480
roots.

204
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,079
Vitamin B1 helps activate the

205
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,600
development of young root tissues,

206
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:39,360
especially after the plant has been

207
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,360
damaged by root rot or

208
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:46,000
pruning. Oat water contains plenty of B

209
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:47,760
vitamins, natural sugars, and minerals,

210
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,519
making it a gentle source of nutrients

211
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,519
that is easily absorbed through the

212
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:58,279
roots. Then, soak the orchid pot in this

213
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,279
mixture for about 10 minutes.

214
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,680
After soaking the orchid pot in the

215
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,760
mixture for 10 minutes, take it out and

216
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,320
place the plant in a spot with diffused

217
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,040
light, such as near a window with a

218
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:24,519
sheer curtain or under a canopy with

219
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,519
indirect sunlight.

220
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:39,680
And here is the result after 1 month of

221
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,680
caring for the orchid with natural

222
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,720
fertilizer. You can see that my orchid

223
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,160
has grown many new

224
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,600
roots. The growth of new roots is the

225
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,600
clearest sign that the plant has

226
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,600
recovered.

227
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,760
Orchids only grow new roots when they

228
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,680
sense that their environment is safe,

229
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,160
has enough nutrients, and receives the

230
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,160
right amount of

231
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:10,000
light. And the orchid has also grown a

232
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,000
new baby

233
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:16,800
shoot. The baby shoot is a clear sign

234
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,320
that the mother plant is healthy and has

235
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,320
enough energy to produce the next

236
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,320
generation.

237
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,000
This is the stage when the orchid begins

238
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:31,760
natural propagation. A very positive

239
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,760
sign in its recovery and growth

240
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:37,279
process. Today's baby shoot is the

241
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,279
future flower

242
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,839
spike. If cared for properly, over time,

243
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,920
the baby plant will grow into a new

244
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,880
orchid branch capable of blooming on its

245
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,880
own.

246
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,760
You see, after just one month of

247
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,680
patiently caring with natural

248
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,680
ingredients, the orchid has not only

249
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,360
grown new roots, but is also confidently

250
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:07,160
reaching upward with a fresh, hopeful

251
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,160
little baby shoot.

252
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,560
Uh, I will continue to care for this

253
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,120
orchid with the natural fertilizer

254
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,519
mixture of oats and B1 once every 2

255
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:36,279
weeks to nourish healthy roots and

256
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,279
support strong growth of the new chute.

257
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,160
Uh, I will continue to care for this

258
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,720
orchid with the natural fertilizer

259
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,120
mixture of oats and B1 once every 2

260
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,880
weeks to nourish healthy roots and

261
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,880
support strong growth of the new

262
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:06,959
chute. After each time you apply this

263
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,800
natural fertilizer, don't forget to wipe

264
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,600
the leaves clean using the same

265
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,600
nutrient-rich

266
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,480
mixture. Um, step by step, gently but

267
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,240
consistently, you will witness your

268
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,199
orchid come back to life and grow

269
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,199
stronger day by

270
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,839
day. Uh, then remember to soak the

271
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,759
orchid pot in this mixture for about 20

272
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:34,040
minutes so the roots can fully absorb

273
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,040
the nutrients from the oatmeal and B1.

274
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,959
Then take the orchid pot out and place

275
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,399
it in a spot with gentle sunlight. This

276
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,560
soft light will help the plant

277
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,399
photosynthesize better, boost its

278
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,240
metabolism, and thereby support root

279
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,639
growth, shoot development, and overall

280
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,639
healthy

281
00:16:54,050 --> 00:17:00,160
[Music]

282
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:03,279
growth. And here is the result after the

283
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,279
next 3 months.

284
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,360
The orchid has grown so much. Its leaves

285
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,679
are lush green and the roots are strong

286
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,679
and

287
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,120
healthy. And most especially, it has

288
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,919
sprouted two brand new flower spikes

289
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,919
full of life and energy.

290
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,919
This proves that the orchid not only

291
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,679
recovered successfully but also entered

292
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,679
a vigorous growth phase and bloomed

293
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:46,559
again. The method of caring with natural

294
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,480
fertilizer made from oats and vitamin B1

295
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:53,240
is effective, safe, and suitable for

296
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,240
orchids after root rot or leaf damage.

297
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:57,890
[Music]

298
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,679
You can now remove this old leaf so the

299
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:05,960
orchid can concentrate its nutrients on

300
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,960
the flowers that are about to bloom.

301
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,740
[Music]

302
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
with gentle care, tenderness, and love,

303
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,039
you can absolutely help your orchid

304
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,720
revive and bloom beautifully as it once

305
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:42,720
did. Wishing you continued joy and

306
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,720
perseverance as you care for each leaf

307
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,160
and every tiny root of your orchid.

308
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,480
Let each day together be a moment of

309
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,520
relaxation, healing, and deep

310
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,919
affection. Even though the journey of

311
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,000
care may be slow at times, the reward

312
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,080
will always be sweet. Just like the

313
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,640
orchid petals that bloom wide after many

314
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,400
days of waiting, may your orchid stems

315
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,320
always stay vibrant, healthy, and bring

316
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,320
you happiness every single day.
