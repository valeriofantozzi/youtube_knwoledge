Welcome to Happiness Garden

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,166
where the simplest things become magical

3
00:00:04,166 --> 00:00:06,566
moments that nurture the beauty of nature

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,266
Today I'm sharing another simple

5
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:13,366
yet highly effective way to grow and care for orchids

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,466
with this easy to make natural fertilizer at home

7
00:00:16,466 --> 00:00:18,033
even weak orchids can recover

8
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:20,400
grow well and bloom beautifully

9
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:28,166
when growing orchids at home

10
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:31,966
everyone hopes their orchid spikes will produce lots of buds

11
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:33,166
and bloom with vibrant

12
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:36,733
healthy flowers just like the orchids I take care of every day

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,700
please comment

14
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,533
and let me know which country you're watching the video from

15
00:00:45,866 --> 00:00:49,966
uh it's wonderful that we can chat together from all around the world

16
00:00:57,433 --> 00:00:58,866
when orchids begin to bloom

17
00:00:58,866 --> 00:01:02,200
each flower stays on the spike for a long time before fading

18
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,900
as if trying to prolong its gentle and pure beauty over time

19
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:09,400
and right now

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,066
I'll guide you through the steps in a simple and detailed way

21
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:15,266
so you can start applying it to your beloved orchid pots right away

22
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:25,600
each month you only need to water each orchid pot one to two times

23
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,266
just like the way I always do

24
00:01:27,266 --> 00:01:30,000
simple yet surprisingly effective

25
00:01:41,966 --> 00:01:45,700
regular watering helps orchids maintain the necessary moisture

26
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,733
allowing them to absorb nutrients more effectively

27
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:50,600
when provided with enough moisture

28
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,566
the flowers will bloom fully and stay on the spike for a long time

29
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:57,533
before fading like a lasting gift from nature

30
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,666
you can keep the orchid in its pot

31
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,700
and soak it in water for about 10 to 20 minutes

32
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:09,866
this method allows the roots to absorb enough moisture

33
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:12,766
without causing the plant to become waterlogged

34
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:24,800
after that don't forget to take the orchid pot out and let it drain

35
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,733
allowing the roots to breathe and preventing rot

it's wonderful to have you along

40
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,766
to start making natural fertilizer for orchids

41
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:47,966
you only need one very familiar ingredient from the kitchen garlic

42
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:56,600
take 2 cloves of garlic and slice them very thinly

43
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,100
so the nutrients can easily dissolve into the water

44
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,866
after slicing place the garlic into a clean bottle

45
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:19,533
to prepare the watering solution for your orchids

46
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,266
next pour about 1 liter of room temperature water into the bottle

47
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,500
to help the garlic release its natural compounds effectively

48
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,166
the next ingredient is honey

49
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:37,766
a natural component rich in nutrients that help stimulate root growth

50
00:03:37,766 --> 00:03:39,266
and boost the plant's resistance

51
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,966
just add 1 teaspoon of honey to the mixture

52
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:55,866
and stir gently until the honey is completely dissolved in the water

53
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:00,833
garlic and honey combined

54
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:04,733
create a mixture with natural antibacterial and antiseptic properties

55
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:08,100
helping eliminate harmful fungi in the orchid growing medium

56
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,300
while also providing nutrients that support healthy growth

57
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,366
from root to tip

58
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,966
after finishing you just need to wait about 1 hour for the nutrients

59
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,466
from the garlic and honey

60
00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:21,900
to fully infuse into the water

61
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,066
creating a nutrient rich solution ready for your orchids

62
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:38,600
if you have a weak orchid that hasn't been able to bloom

63
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,500
start by checking its roots

64
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,300
remove any damaged roots and leaves

65
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,500
then replant the orchid in a clean growing medium

66
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,500
this is the first step to help it recover

67
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,900
and prepare for the next blooming cycle

68
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,866
this helps prevent the spread of fungal diseases

69
00:04:57,866 --> 00:05:01,100
while allowing the plant to focus on nourishing its healthy parts

70
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:03,866
as a result new roots will grow vigorously

71
00:05:03,866 --> 00:05:05,766
helping the plant recover quickly

72
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,266
and get ready for the next blooming cycle

73
00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:32,833
after soaking for about 1 hour

74
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,200
strain out the residue to get a clear solution

75
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,100
which helps the orchid absorb nutrients more effectively

76
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:40,566
and prevents clogging in the growing medium

77
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,400
step 1 use a soft cloth soaked in the solution

78
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,700
then gently wipe both the top and underside of the leaves

79
00:05:56,833 --> 00:06:00,800
this method not only helps clean dust and effectively kill bacteria

80
00:06:00,966 --> 00:06:04,333
uh but also delivers nutrients directly through the leaves

81
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:07,700
allowing the plant to absorb them quickly and recover better

82
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,433
you can also apply this method to healthy orchids

83
00:06:20,433 --> 00:06:21,866
to boost their resistance

84
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:26,166
keep the leaves glossy green and help the flowers last longer

85
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,233
apply this method regularly

86
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:37,833
one to two times a month for the orchid pots in your garden

87
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:41,333
to maintain their health and vibrant beauty all year round

88
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:55,500
step 2 soak the orchid roots in the garlic and honey solution

89
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,733
for about 10 to 20 minutes

90
00:06:58,866 --> 00:07:01,266
this method not only helps naturally disinfect

91
00:07:01,266 --> 00:07:04,766
but also stimulates new root growth to be stronger and healthier

92
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,566
creating a solid foundation for the orchid to recover and thrive

93
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:14,366
the remaining

94
00:07:14,366 --> 00:07:17,700
solution can be used to water each orchid pot in your garden

95
00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:20,400
this is a simple way to provide extra nutrients

96
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,300
and boost the plant's resistance

97
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,466
regularly watering with the garlic and honey mixture

98
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:33,166
helps orchids strengthen their resistance against fungi

99
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,600
and harmful bacteria in the growing medium

100
00:07:36,266 --> 00:07:38,400
as a result the plant stays healthy

101
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,166
and is less affected by its surrounding environment

102
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:48,900
um this nutrient rich solution helps the roots grow strong

103
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,600
and absorb water and minerals more efficiently

104
00:07:52,033 --> 00:07:53,500
when the roots are healthy

105
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,833
the orchid has enough energy to produce more blooms that are vibrant

106
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,066
and long lasting

107
00:08:01,866 --> 00:08:05,533
you can also pour the remaining solution into a spray bottle

108
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,100
and lightly mist the leaves of the orchid pots in your garden

109
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,933
this method helps clean the leaves

110
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:16,133
kill bacteria and provide nutrients directly through the leaf surface

111
00:08:23,233 --> 00:08:25,500
you can apply this fertilizer every two weeks

112
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,400
or flexibly alternate it with other natural fertilizers

113
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,700
such as banana aloe Vera

114
00:08:30,866 --> 00:08:32,566
fish emulsion soybean

115
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:35,266
or molasses to provide a diverse range of nutrients

116
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:37,133
for your orchid's overall growth

117
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,466
spraying the garlic and honey mixture on the leaves

118
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:54,200
helps clean the leaf surface

119
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:56,766
eliminate harmful bacteria and fungi

120
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:57,800
and at the same time

121
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,200
provide a natural layer of nutrients that keeps the leaves glossy

122
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,600
healthy and enhances their photosynthesis capacity

123
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:22,633
after soaking gently take the orchid out and replant it in

124
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:25,900
a new pot with clean well aerated growing medium

125
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,966
this is an important step to help the plant start fresh

126
00:09:28,966 --> 00:09:30,266
in a better environment

127
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:42,300
and here is another weak orchid that I treated with this care method

128
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,233
three weeks ago as you can see

129
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:46,600
it has started to grow many new roots

130
00:09:46,766 --> 00:09:48,933
a very positive sign of recovery

131
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,700
when the root system becomes healthy again

132
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:57,333
the plant will start to absorb water and nutrients more effectively

133
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,700
and gradually the once wilted leaves will come back to life

134
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,300
when the roots absorb enough water and nutrients

135
00:10:06,566 --> 00:10:09,300
the orchid can sustain its flowers more effectively

136
00:10:09,766 --> 00:10:12,833
as a result the petals on the spike stay fresh

137
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:16,266
vibrant and retain their beauty for a long time before fading

138
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:21,800
after soaking for about 10 to 20 minutes

139
00:10:21,866 --> 00:10:24,133
once the roots have absorbed enough nutrients

140
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,566
take the orchid pot out and place it in a spot with gentle sunlight

141
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,433
uh this helps the plant photosynthesize better

142
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:32,666
recover quickly and grow healthily

143
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,700
when provided with good fertilizer and enough light for photosynthesis

144
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,833
the orchid will grow healthily and its leaves will always be lush

145
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:45,466
green and glossy a clear sign of a happy plant

146
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,466
thanks to proper care orchids will bloom more brilliantly than usual

147
00:10:55,566 --> 00:10:58,933
shining dazzlingly and brightening up the surrounding space

148
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:07,233
many petals can bloom simultaneously on the same spike

149
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,200
and those flowers will stay fresh for a long time before fading

150
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,666
creating a truly vibrant and impressive scene

151
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:21,200
what do you think about how I care for these small orchids

161
00:11:57,533 --> 00:11:58,733
welcome to my channel

162
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:03,500
when orchids have enough nutrients and good soil environment

163
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,966
the plant will grow stronger and flower more

164
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,600
to help create the best conditions for flower development

165
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,466
at the same time make orchids bloom more beautiful

166
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,900
both roots and flowers grow beyond imagination

167
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,900
in this video I share a new fertilizer that few people know about

168
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:05,766
let's explore with me now

169
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:13,500
when when you plant a lot of orchids the orchid rot is inevitable

170
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:26,500
if it accidentally rots you need to cut off the rotten part right away

171
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:37,133
then isolate the rotten orchid pot from other normal orchid pots

172
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,066
this helps prevent rot from spreading to normal orchids

173
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:07,700
after cutting off the rotten part you need to dry the rot solution

174
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,766

it's great that we can chat together from all over the world

180
00:14:53,466 --> 00:14:56,800
um waste from rotten orchids should be isolated from the garden

181
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,933
as far as possible

182
00:15:06,266 --> 00:15:10,266
this is activated carbon it is made from natural dry firewood

183
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:34,700
I took a piece of activated carbon like this and ground it into powder

184
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:07,166
then sprinkle activated charcoal powder on the newly cut wound

185
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:10,600
helps cuts heal faster and eliminates fungal diseases

186
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,866
because activated carbon has a very good sterilization function

187
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,933
then you sprinkle more in between the two leaves and on the base

188
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,666
then put the orchid pot in a cool place and do not water for one week

189
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,500
the orchid will recover from the disease

190
00:17:28,366 --> 00:17:29,200
next way

191
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,333
mix 1 teaspoon of activated carbon with 1 liter of water

192
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,300
then use this water to water the base of the orchid

193
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,166
perform periodically once every two weeks for normal orchids

194
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,800
helps prevent disease and improve pH in growing media

195
00:18:33,366 --> 00:18:36,666
in activated carbon there is also a high content of Calcium

196
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,466
and natural minerals that are very good for orchids

197
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,666
help stimulate rooting

198
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,200
soaking this water for 30 minutes is better

199
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,566
the next way you filter this water to get clear water

200
00:19:29,266 --> 00:19:31,300
then use this water to wash the leaves

201
00:19:43,366 --> 00:19:46,100
orchid will be protected from fungi and insects

202
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,300
the Calcium content in activated carbon helps to strengthen the leaves

203
00:20:21,266 --> 00:20:25,200
do it regularly once every two weeks and you will be healthy like this

204
00:20:48,266 --> 00:20:52,133
you can also use this water to spray the entire orchid

205
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:56,200
it helps to eliminate fungi and insects on leaves very well

206
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,900
and it also provides some nutrients through the leaves

207
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,700
now let's see the results

208
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:32,700
lots of new roots growing

209
00:21:32,766 --> 00:21:35,200
this helps orchids absorb nutrients best

210
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,400
the potassium and phosphorus content in activated carbon

211
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
stimulates extremely fast rooting

212
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,166
the flowers are brighter and stronger

213
00:23:09,366 --> 00:23:11,733
many flower buds growing on the same tree

214
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,000
surely you will be surprised with this fertilizer

215
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,000
if you find it interesting

216
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,533
