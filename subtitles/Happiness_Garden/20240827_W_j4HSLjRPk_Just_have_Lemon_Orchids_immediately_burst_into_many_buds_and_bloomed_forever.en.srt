00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello friends!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,998
Today we will take care of orchids with the help of a very useful and fragrant lemon.

3
00:00:14,205 --> 00:00:22,196
Or more precisely, lemon peel contains a lot of vitamin C and essential oils.

4
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:33,594
Choose 1 lemon.

5
00:00:41,494 --> 00:00:52,490
then just take the shell.

6
00:01:05,976 --> 00:01:12,953
Chopped.

7
00:01:36,106 --> 00:01:58,077
Then puree with 500ml of water.

8
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:31,970
Filter out residue.

9
00:02:39,314 --> 00:02:47,301
Take 100ml of juice from lemon peel.

10
00:02:55,564 --> 00:03:05,530
Add water to get 1 liter of solution.

11
00:03:12,511 --> 00:03:16,495
First way:

12
00:03:21,097 --> 00:03:32,092
Clean the leaves with a solution of the juice from the lemon peel.

13
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:47,255
This protects them from pests..

14
00:03:52,623 --> 00:04:01,619
Wipe the underside of the leaves carefully because this is where fungi,

15
00:04:01,619 --> 00:04:11,186
bacteria, and insects often gather to harm the orchid.

16
00:04:14,956 --> 00:04:18,949
Second way:

17
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:52,443
Spray this solution on the entire orchid.

18
00:04:57,246 --> 00:05:06,240
This helps wash away dirt,

19
00:05:10,455 --> 00:05:20,437
and eliminate fungal diseases, bacteria and harmful insects.

20
00:05:26,224 --> 00:05:36,247
Spray this mixture on orchids every 2 weeks.

21
00:05:38,536 --> 00:05:47,452
But do not spray on flowers and buds.

22
00:05:47,452 --> 00:05:55,996
because wet flowers will quickly fall off.

23
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,817
3rd way:

24
00:06:05,637 --> 00:06:14,126
Water this solution to take care of the roots.

25
00:06:15,413 --> 00:06:25,391
Lemon peel acidifies the orchid juice, which contributes to better absorption of nutrients.

26
00:06:29,532 --> 00:06:39,642
Essential oils repel pests and protect orchid leaves and roots from harmful bacteria..

27
00:06:55,033 --> 00:07:04,973
Or soak the orchid pot in this solution for 30 minutes, it will be better.

28
00:07:05,848 --> 00:07:14,252
Do this every 2 weeks and the orchid will always be protected.

29
00:07:16,173 --> 00:07:28,930
If you don't use all of it, you can freeze the juice from the lemon zest for later use.

30
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:42,209
View results.

31
00:07:43,109 --> 00:07:50,573
After 3 times of use, the roots grow very well.

32
00:08:04,472 --> 00:08:16,546
Branched roots develop to help the orchid absorb more nutrients.

33
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:30,000
Leaves are clean, always green and free from pests.

34
00:08:31,503 --> 00:08:42,296
help orchids photosynthesize better.

35
00:08:46,657 --> 00:08:54,975
flower buds grow and do not fall.

36
00:08:57,573 --> 00:09:07,684
Flowers bloom brightly and stay fresh.

37
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:19,473
Flowers stay on the branch for up to 6 months before falling.

38
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:30,188

00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:40,867
