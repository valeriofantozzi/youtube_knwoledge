00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,679
Today, I want to share with you a simple

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,639
but very effective method using natural

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,640
fertilizer that helps orchids develop

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,880
strong roots and exceptionally healthy

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,880
green leaves.

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,359
Your orchid will produce many flower

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,439
spikes, and when blooming, the flowers

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:31,359
will be vibrant in color, lasting long

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,359

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,120
The first ingredient I use to make

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,600
natural fertilizer is pure coffee

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,960
powder, a nutrient-rich source that is

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,960
very good for the healthy development of

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,960
orchids.

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,399
Take one spoon of pure coffee powder

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,760
into a bottle, then mix it with half a

22
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,640
liter of boiling water to create a

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,640
nutrient solution for orchids.

Next, take half a liter of room

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,520

33
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,520
another glass.

35
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,150
Then add one spoon of baking yeast into

36
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:18,490
that glass of water.

The last ingredient I use is oatmeal

40
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,480
powder, a rich source of important

41
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,200
nutrients that helps orchids grow

cooled, stir well and then strain out

54
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,799
the coffee grounds to collect The

ratio to safely use it for orchids.

59
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,600
Step one, use a soft cloth to soak the

60
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,280
diluted coffee solution. Then gently

61
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,520
wipe both the upper and lower surfaces

62
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,520
of the leaves.

63
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,600
This method helps clean dust off the

64
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,960

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,240
If you see leaves that are wilted,

78
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,000
yellow, or damaged, you need to remove

79
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,759
them immediately to help the plant

Properly wiping the leaves also helps

grow strong and healthier every day.

124
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,360
The compounds in coffee also help

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,519
harmful agents.

128
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,760
When sprayed on the leaves, coffee helps

absorb energy better from light.

133
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,480
The coffee solution also helps improve

pot in this mixture for about 20 minutes

168
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,000

cause leaf rot or damage.

Wiping off water droplets on the leaves

182
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,320
helps prevent the growth of mold and

183
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,720
bacteria, protecting orchid leaves from

184
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,720
harmful diseases.

Cleaned leaves help the plant breathe
