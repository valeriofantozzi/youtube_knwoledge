wonderful to have you with me on this

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,840
journey.

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,440
Let's get

15
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,840
started. To make fertilizer for orchids,

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,760
now I use

17
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,600
beer. Um, recently the method of using

18
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,160
beer to water plants has been widely

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,399
spread among bonsai enthusiasts as a way

20
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,399
to help plants grow green and flower

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,719
more. If you're interested in this

22
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,280
topic, let's try using beer to make

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,530
fertilizer for

24
00:00:50,280 --> 00:01:06,960
orchids. Four spoons of beer.

[Music]

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:23,320
dilute in 1 k2 liter of water at room

[Music]

28
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,640
temperature. First

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,880
way, irrigate the root

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:36,240
[Music]

31
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,400
evenly. Leave me a comment letting me

32
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,000
know which country you're watching from.

33
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,990
It's wonderful that we can connect and

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:50,280
chat with each other from all around the

35
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:52,799
[Music]

36
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,040
world. How to water orchids will help

37
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,200
plants grow better everyday thanks to

38
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,119
the formula containing sugar and starch

39
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,600
water. These ingredients in beer contain

40
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,040
high nutrient

41
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,119
content. After soaking into the

42
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,360
substrate, it will form an energy source

43
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,360
for orchids.

44
00:02:28,930 --> 00:03:03,760
[Music]

45
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,100
This will be a clean fertilizer for

46
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:19,440
orchids, helping plants grow better.

47
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:20,959
[Music]

48
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,480
This will be a clean fertilizer for

49
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,480
orchids, helping plants grow

50
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:34,239
[Music]

51
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:36,480
better. Beer can repel insects harmful

52
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,799
to orchids, protecting the safety of the

53
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,799
entire orchid.

54
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,640
Uh the characteristic beer smell will

55
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:48,080
keep animals like snails bees away

56
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,080
thereby helping the plant to grow

57
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:55,750
well. Do this with your orchid once a

58
00:03:52,799 --> 00:04:03,439
month.

59
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:05,760
[Music]

60
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,760
Second

61
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,280
way, pour this water into a spray

62
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,280
bottle.

63
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:40,639
[Music]

64
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,639
Spray evenly on the surface of the

65
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:52,080
substrate. Beer contains many beneficial

66
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,980
phytonutrients that including minerals,

67
00:04:52,080 --> 00:05:05,339
sugars, and proteins.

[Music]

69
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,680
These substances will help plants grow

70
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,680
and improve health quickly.

71

[Music]

72
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,070
Beer also contains protein which is an

73
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:31,119
essential nutrient for plant growth.

74
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:31,119

77
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,199

80
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,830
When eating bananas, don't rush to throw

81
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:39,190
away the shell.

[Music]

83
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:51,960
Use the white side of the banana

85
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:57,080

[Music]

87
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,199
Clean both the top and bottom of the

88
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:17,160
[Music]

89
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:20,359
leaves. Do this once a month.

[Music]

92
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,360
Let's see the

93
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:40,180
result. My orchids are cared for by this

94
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,180
[Music]

95
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,039
method. Leaves thrive. Big sturdy

96
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,300
leaves. Leaves are not attacked by

97
00:07:45,039 --> 00:08:07,199
insects.

98
00:07:47,300 --> 00:08:09,120
[Music]

99
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,440
Due to enough nutrition, there are many

100
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,440
flower buds.

101
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:16,000
[Music]

102
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,120
The natural phosphorus content in beer

103
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:25,000
helps orchids easily absorb like so the

104
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,000
roots grow very strongly.

105
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,699
[Music]

106
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,200
The natural potassium content in beer

107
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:57,240
makes it easy for orchids to absorb, so

108
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,240
flower buds develop more.

109
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:25,009
[Music]

110
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,330
Potassium and sugar and beer help

111
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:42,640
flowers bloom longer.

112
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:44,720
[Music]

113
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,680
Um, potassium is a substance that helps

114
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,760
carry water from the root to the flower.

115
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,120
Because the water is transported enough,

116
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,040
the flowers will stay fresh for a long

117
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:58,480
time. The flowers can bloom for about 3

118
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,080
to 6 months before fading.

119
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,680
When orchids are healthy and

120
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,800
wellnourished, they have the ability to

121
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,800
bloom multiple times a year, bringing

122
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,080
vibrant beauty and freshness to your

123
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,080
garden throughout all four

124
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,839
