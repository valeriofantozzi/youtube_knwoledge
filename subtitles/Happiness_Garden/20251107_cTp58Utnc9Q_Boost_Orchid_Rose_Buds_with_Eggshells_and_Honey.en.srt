00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,560
Welcome to the happiness garden, where

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,279
we gently and lovingly care for each

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,800
little green sprout.

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,880
In today's video, I want to tell you

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,599
about a very simple natural formula that

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,759
brings surprising results. Uh, a bud

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:20,240
stimulating solution for orchids and

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:22,000
roses made from eggshells and honey.

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,840
Uh when these two familiar ingredients

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,519
are combined, they create a pure source

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,119
of nutrients that helps the plant

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,439
recover quickly, nourish the buds, and

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,439
prepare for a more vibrant blooming

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,439
season.

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,879
Eggshells contain a large amount of

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,440
calcium, an essential nutrient that

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,040
helps the roots stay strong and supports

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,920
the plant in forming buds more

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,320
vigorously. Meanwhile, honey contains

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,840
natural enzymes that stimulate growth,

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,640
helping the plant sprout quickly and

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,640
develop with full vitality.

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,840
First, prepare a clean bottle and pour

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,840
one liter of water into it.

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,040
Next, add 1 teasp of honey into the

26
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,040
bottle.

27
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,880
This small amount of honey plays a very

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,400
important role as it provides natural

29
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,960
enzymes that help stimulate the

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,759
development of roots and buds right from

31
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,759
the very first steps.

32
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,449
[Music]

33
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,720
Next, take three clean eggshells and

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,119
crush them finely. When the eggshells

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,280
are broken down this small, the calcium

36
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,880
dissolves more easily in the water,

37
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,119
allowing the plant to absorb it more

38
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:47,000
quickly and effectively throughout the

39
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,000
bud nurturing process.

40
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,320
Let me know in the comments which

41
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,920
country you're watching from. It's

42
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,600
amazing that we can connect and chat

43
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,600
with each other from all over the world.

[Music]

45
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,720
After preparing everything, add the

46
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,720
crushed eggshells into the bottle. Then

47
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,040
stir well so the nutrients can begin to

48
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,040
blend together.

49
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,480
[Music]

50
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,720
Finally, simply close the lid and let

51
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,040
the mixture rest overnight.

52
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,440
This time allows the eggshells and honey

53
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,680
to release their nutrients completely,

54
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:44,040
uh, creating a powerful natural bud

55
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,040
stimulating solution for your plants.

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:50,229
[Music]

57
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,280
Um, after the mixture has been left to

58
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,200
sit overnight, you just need to stir it

59
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,519
once more so the nutrients can fully

60
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,519
blend together.

61
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,120
[Music]

62
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,760
Next, strain out the residue to obtain a

63
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,360
clean, clear solution. Removing the

64
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,760
residue helps the solution absorb

65
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,440
quickly into the roots and leaves and

66
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,400
also prevents clogging the surface of

67
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,400
the growing medium when watering.

68
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:40,470
[Music]

69
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,470
[Applause]

70
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,840
For orchids, you just need to apply this

71
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,959
fertilizer solution directly to the

72
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,680
roots and growing medium or alternate it

73
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,080
with other natural fertilizers. By using

74
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,760
it regularly two to three times a month,

75
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,239
the plant will gradually absorb the

76
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,630
nutrients, recover strongly, and prepare

77
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,789
for healthier new buds.

78
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,789
[Music]

79
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,080
The mixture made from eggshells and

80
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,959
honey provides a natural source of

81
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,200
calcium that helps the orchids orchids

82
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,880
roots grow stronger. When the roots are

83
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,799
healthy, the plant has enough energy to

84
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,799
nourish its buds, which in turn

85
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:25,560
stimulates the formation and development

86
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,560
of new flower spikes more quickly.

87
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,080
[Music]

88
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,400
The natural enzymes in honey act as

89
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,240
growth catalysts, helping the plant

90
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,560
enhance its metabolism and restore

91
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,240
vitality. Thanks to this, orchids can

92
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,440
produce buds more easily, especially

93
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,420
during the period when they are

94
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,480
preparing for a new blooming season.

[Music]

96
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,040
The solution after being left to sit

97
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,479
overnight also helps balance the

98
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,479
nutrients in the growing medium,

99
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,040
allowing the plant to absorb them more

100
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,280
effectively. When the living environment

101
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,040
is stable and rich in minerals, orchids

102
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,520
will develop strong, plump, and evenly

103
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:11,960
formed buds, promising vibrant clusters

104
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,960
of blooms in a short time.

108
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,840
Next, for roses, you can use this

109
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,080
mixture to water the plant every 3 days,

110
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,360
helping it steadily absorb the essential

111
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:34,320
nutrients needed for bud development.

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:36,400
[Music]

113
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,720
Uh on the alternating days, remember to

114
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,120
water the soil to keep it moist because

115
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,520
roses always need more water and more

116
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,440
nutrients compared to orchids. When they

117
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,759
receive enough of both, the plants grow

118
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,759
vigorously, their buds form strongly,

119
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,759
and the flowers become larger and more

120
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,759
defined.

121
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,320
Calcium from the eggshells helps the

122
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,240
stems and branches become stronger,

123
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,880
creating a solid foundation for the

124
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,960
plant to support healthy buds.

125
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,560
Meanwhile, honey provides growth enzymes

126
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,639
that help the plant speed up its

127
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,840
metabolism, thereby promoting the

128
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,840
formation of flower buds. When these two

129
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,919
factors combine, roses will soon enter

130
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,240
the pre-blooming stage with vibrant,

131
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,240
healthy buds.

133
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,639
Step two, you can also pour the mixture

134
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,440
into a clean spray bottle to mist it

135
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,440
directly onto your orchids.

136
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,880
Then gently mist the solution over the

137
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,720
entire orchid on the leaf surfaces, the

138
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,360
aerial roots, the base, and the growing

139
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,880

140
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,759
coat the plant, allowing the nutrients

141
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,080
to absorb evenly and helping the orchid

142
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,310
push out new buds more quickly and more

143
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:13,589

entire plant, the fine droplets cling

147
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,759
directly to the leaf surfaces and aerial

148
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,599
roots, allowing the plant to absorb

149
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,160
nutrients faster than with regular

150
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,919
watering. Thanks to this folure

151
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,400
absorption, your orchid receives an

152
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:34,680
instant boost of energy, creating ideal

153
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,680

Misting evenly over the leaves also

156
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,759
helps remove dust and increases the

157
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,240
plant's ability to photosynthesize. When

158
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,759
the leaves breathe better and receive

159
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,599
enough light, the plant becomes

160
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,960
stronger, making it easier for it to

161
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,960
enter the stage of forming new buds.

162
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,599
Misting the fertilizer in a fine spray

163
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,000
also helps maintain light moisture

164
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,840
across the entire plant, creating an

165
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,720
ideal environment for orchids to

166
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,800
activate their natural growth hormones.

167
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,479
The combination of stable humidity and

168
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,160
the nutrients from the solution will

169

194
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,240
After applying the fertilizer, you

195
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,320
should place the rose pot in a spot with

196
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,000
gentle morning sunlight and good air

197
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,399
flow so the plant can absorb the

198
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,399
nutrients optimally.

199
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,320
Roses love sunlight. So when they

200
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,560
receive gentle light for 4 to 6 hours a

201
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,360
day, the plant photosynthesizes more

202
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,200
strongly. Its stems become sturdier and

203
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,760
bud formation is stimulated more

204
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,760
quickly. At the same time, a

205
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,160
wellventilated environment helps reduce

206
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,610
fungal diseases and allows new buds to

207
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:25,600
develop strongly from within.

209
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,680
and here are the results after 1 month

210
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,680
of care.

211
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,120
You can also notice that the orchid has

212
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,720
grown two new flower spikes looking very

213
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,640
healthy and full of vitality. These buds

214
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,519
are clear evidence of the effectiveness

215
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,959
of the natural bud stimulating solution,

216
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:49,399
helping the plant prepare for the

217
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,399
upcoming vibrant blooming season.

[Music]

220
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,959
Additionally, you can also see that the

221
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,120
plant's roots have grown strongly,

222
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,959
firmly anchoring into the medium and

223
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,160
extending outward into the surrounding

224
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:20,560
space. Healthy roots provide a solid

225
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,040
foundation for the plant to fully absorb

226
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,900
nutrients, thereby supporting better bud

227
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:40,140
and flower development.

229
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,200
Um, this orchid, although its buds are

230
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,440
developing slightly slower than the

231
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,000
previous plant, still shows two new

232
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,920
flower spikes clearly emerging. This

233
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,160
demonstrates that despite the different

234
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,640
pace, the bud stimulating solution is

235
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,560
still effective, gradually helping the

236
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,560
plant form healthy and vibrant flower

237
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,560

And here are the results for the rose

240
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,880
plant after a period of care. You can

241
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,959
see many buds have grown, looking

242
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,720
healthy and full of vitality, promising

243
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:22,160
vibrant clusters of flowers soon to

244
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,079
bloom. Uh the natural solution has truly

245
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,880
helped the plant recover and strongly

246
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:31,040
stimulate new bud development.

[Music]

248
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,040
The newly emerging buds show that the

249
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:38,000
rose is gradually entering the blooming

250
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,160
stage with stronger stems and lusher

251
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,920
green leaves. When the plant is

252
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,000
regularly supplied with nutrients and

253
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,399
water, the buds will grow bigger,

254
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,330
sturdier, and bloom evenly, bringing a

255
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:52,800
vibrant and colorful flowering season.

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,200
follow each step as instructed, the

259
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,320
