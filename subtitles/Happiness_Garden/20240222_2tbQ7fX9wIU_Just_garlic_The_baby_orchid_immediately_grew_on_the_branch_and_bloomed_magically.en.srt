00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,999
Welcome to a unique video tutorial on water orchid propagation!

2
00:00:08,999 --> 00:00:16,997
We will show you how to simply and effectively regenerate all your favorite orchids.

3
00:00:16,997 --> 00:00:26,562
Let's discover how to create amazingly beautiful flowers from these fun propagation methods.

4
00:00:27,562 --> 00:00:37,926
See now to become a master gardener and enjoy the natural beauty of your beautiful orchids!

5
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:50,624
This is a pot of Dendrobium orchids.

6
00:00:50,624 --> 00:01:00,089
This old orchid won't be able to resurrect itself, so I cut it off from the base.

7
00:01:07,866 --> 00:01:28,850
These nodes can sprout into small orchids.

8
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:52,434
Now I cut the nodes to propagate.

9
00:01:56,005 --> 00:02:05,976
After cutting, you should immediately apply toothpaste on the cut to disinfect.

10
00:02:05,976 --> 00:02:18,687
This helps protect the cut from rot.

11
00:02:22,523 --> 00:02:32,504
then wait for the toothpaste to dry.

12
00:02:42,185 --> 00:02:59,198
I recycle used plastic baskets for orchid propagation.

13
00:03:18,412 --> 00:03:33,392
After the toothpaste at the tip of the cut had dried, I clipped the orchid to a plastic basket.

14
00:03:51,588 --> 00:04:01,586
Pour 1 liter of room temperature water into the bowl.

15
00:04:04,809 --> 00:04:22,782
Soak 2 vitamin B1 tablets in this water.

16
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:49,810
Add 3 cloves of garlic.

17
00:04:49,810 --> 00:05:00,463
Cut into small pieces.

18
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:15,505
Soak the garlic in this water for 2 hours so that the nutrients in the garlic dissolve into the water.

19
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:38,767
AFTER 2 HOURS

20
00:05:40,178 --> 00:05:52,164
Then soak the orchid branch in garlic juice mixed with vitamin B1 for 30 minutes.

21
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:08,827
AFTER 30 MINUTES.

22
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:17,972
Remove the orchid from the pot of water.

23
00:06:22,592 --> 00:06:35,319
Pour room temperature water into the basin.

24
00:06:46,553 --> 00:07:03,650
 
Use a sponge to form a float.

25
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:16,114
It helps the orchid to always float on the water.

26
00:07:16,114 --> 00:07:26,434
The steam that rises will help the orchid germinate easily.

27
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:39,843
1 MONTH LATER.

28
00:07:39,843 --> 00:07:51,514
The nodes of the orchid branch have developed into small orchid sprouts.

29
00:07:51,514 --> 00:08:08,479
With this simple method, after only 1 month, the old orchid branch was revived.

30
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:16,336
I continue to put the orchid branch in the pot of water so that the small orchid branch grows more.

31
00:08:16,336 --> 00:08:22,312
Remember to change the water weekly.

32
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:30,366
AFTER 1 NEXT MONTH.

33
00:08:31,921 --> 00:08:42,897
Small orchids grow very fast.

34
00:08:44,965 --> 00:08:52,962
Roots grow very healthy.

35
00:08:55,486 --> 00:09:05,459
This way you can apply propagation to all other types of orchids.

36
00:09:06,623 --> 00:09:16,590
Hope the video will help you in self-propagating orchids at home.

Now you take it out and plant the little orchid in a pot.

39
00:09:42,352 --> 00:09:50,450
Let the orchid grow normally like other orchids.

40
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:59,034
Goodbye and see you in the next videos.
