5
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:42,892
To make this type of organic fertilizer you need soybeans

6
00:00:44,225 --> 00:00:51,890
Take 3 small spoons of soybeans

7
00:00:57,156 --> 00:01:02,888
Next you need 5-10 small garlic cloves

8
00:01:22,084 --> 00:01:28,883
Add 350ml of water

9
00:01:32,782 --> 00:01:37,881
Next we need yogurt

10
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:47,879
Add 3 small spoons of yogurt

11
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:57,877
Yogurt helps ferment quickly, preventing soybeans and garlic from rotting

12
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:15,874
Cover tightly and leave in a cool place for 3 weeks before using

13
00:02:21,872 --> 00:02:24,872
3 Weeks Later

14
00:02:25,872 --> 00:02:32,870
Take 3 liters of water

15
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:42,868
After incubation for 3 weeks, we have obtained organic fertilizer from soybeans, garlic and fermented yogurt

16
00:02:46,868 --> 00:02:52,900
Take 50ml

17
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:08,830
FIRST METHOD

18
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:25,931
Clean the leaf surface with this liquid fertilizer.

19
00:03:34,531 --> 00:03:48,177
The leaf surface will always be clean and airy with stomata.

20
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:07,651
Orchids will photosynthesize better.

21
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:33,880
Regularly cleaning the leaves 1-2 times a month will help keep the leaves healthy.

22
00:04:46,263 --> 00:04:50,876
SECOND METHOD

23
00:05:06,114 --> 00:05:16,105
Spray this fertilizer on the entire orchid.

24
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:32,868
This method is similar to using foliar fertilizer.

25
00:05:39,951 --> 00:05:47,898
Garlic contains essential oils that help kill fungi and insects very well.

26
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:56,897
Soybeans contain a lot of nitrogen, which helps leaves grow exceptionally well

27
00:05:57,896 --> 00:06:04,895
Spraying aerial roots helps aerial roots develop.

28
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:30,890
THIRD METHOD

29
00:06:36,341 --> 00:06:46,320
Water this fertilizer solution on the orchid roots.

30
00:06:54,885 --> 00:07:03,883
Milk-based fertilizer provides natural calcium which is very good for orchids.

31
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:16,947
Helps orchids stay healthy and resistant to pests.

32
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:36,877
And milk contains a lot of nutrients for orchids.

33
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:15,869
Do this 1-2 times a month to supplement nutrition and increase the orchid's resistance.

34
00:08:25,498 --> 00:08:28,466
RESULT

35
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:42,197
After 3 times of applying this fertilizer method, the root system has developed very strongly.

36
00:08:51,672 --> 00:09:01,660
Roots help orchids absorb and transport nutrients to nourish plants and flowers.

37
00:09:07,107 --> 00:09:17,090
Flowers bloom in more vibrant colors.

38
00:09:26,888 --> 00:09:36,886
The orchid blooms many flowers at the same time but is still healthy.

39
00:09:46,884 --> 00:09:52,883
Flowers bloom for a long time before fading.

40
00:09:54,675 --> 00:09:59,882
