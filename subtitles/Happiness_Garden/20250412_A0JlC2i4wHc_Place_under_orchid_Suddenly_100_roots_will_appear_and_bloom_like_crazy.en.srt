Garlic powder also helps strengthen the

214
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,880
is necessary to combine the use of other

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,440
types of organic fertilizers such as

216
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,919

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:24,400

00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,960

320
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,770
