Hello everyone. I'm so glad you came to

00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,080
my

3
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:09,040
channel. When growing orchids, everyone

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,120
wants the flowers to bloom for a long

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,120
time,

6
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:16,080
right? And each orchid pot will bloom a

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,080
lot of flowers all year

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,199

00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:25,080
round. Now, I will show you what is the

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,080
best fertilizer for orchids.

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,679
Uh, if you follow us till the end of

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,200
this video, you will learn how to make

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:37,039
orchids bloom all year

14
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,039
[Music]

15
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:42,120

16
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,800
[Music]

17
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,719
started. And when the flowers have all

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,780
bloomed, I cut off all the places that

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:01:14,000
are no longer able to flower.

20
00:00:50,780 --> 00:01:16,159
[Music]

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,320
Then sprinkle white cement on the cut to

22
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,479
help the wound dry faster, limit

23
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,080
bacteria and fungi from entering,

24
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,080
thereby promoting ing the wound healing

00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,819
[Music]

26
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,240
process. Unflowered nodes like this will

27
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,880
have the potential to sprout buds or

28
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,880
flower buds.

[Music]

30
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:50,440
Here I peel off the protective film that

31
00:01:47,680 --> 00:02:02,790
will make it easier to germinate.

32
00:01:50,440 --> 00:02:02,790
[Music]

33
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,640
Then I took the tomatoes to make natural

34
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:15,000
fertilizer for the

35
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,440
[Music]

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,440
orchids. Take a slice of tomato like

37
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,440
this.

38
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,680
Tomatoes contain a lot of vitamin A,

39
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,680
vitamin C, and are rich in potassium,

40
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,160
calcium, and phosphorus, which are very

41
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,239
good for orchids. Therefore, when caring

42
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,800
for orchids with tomatoes, orchids will

43
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,800
grow very quickly.

[Music]

50
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,090
I added water to get

51
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:41,080
2.20462 lb of tomato juice, about one

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:44,959

53
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,720
liter. Method one. Then gently wipe the

54
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,160
leaves with the tomato mixture, a

55
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,920
natural way to clean and nourish the

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,840
tomato mixture and wrapping it around

59
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,750
the dormant buds is a good way to

60
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:07,080
stimulate bud growth.

[Music]

62
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,200
You should do this every 7 days to

63
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,410
create the right humidity to stimulate

64
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:36,890
dormant buds to develop into flowers.

67
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,840
I continue to wrap cotton soaked in

68
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,840
tomato mixture here will help this

69
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,690
flower branch continue to bloom new

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,840

[Music]

72
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,639
This method maintains moisture for the

73
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,919
flower stem and the flower tip recovers

74
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,199
very

75
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:05,040
quickly. On normal days, you just need

76
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,240
to use regular water to keep the flower

77
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,790

00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,309

82
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:26,720
too. Tomatoes contain many vitamins and

83
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,560
minerals that can help make the leaves

84
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,000
healthier while removing dirt and

85
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,000

cloth soaked in a diluted tomato mixture

89
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,120

light better and grow

91
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,800

[Music]

99
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,190
You can also use this tomato juice to

100
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,300

root. Wave four.

104
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,280
Use this water to water the orchid once

105
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,280
every two

106
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,199
weeks. Orchids grow because nutrients

107
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,039
are transported from the roots to all

108
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,479
parts of the orchid, including the

109
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,479
flower stock furthest from the

110
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:16,560
roots. Before fertilizing, water the

111
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,390
orchid pots thoroughly. This will help

112
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:27,749
the plant absorb the fertilizer better.

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,000

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,420
regenerated flower branches will be very

00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:06,960
