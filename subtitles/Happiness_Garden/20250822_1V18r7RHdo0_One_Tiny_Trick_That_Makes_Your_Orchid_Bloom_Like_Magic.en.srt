00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,519
Today I will share with you an amazing

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,920
tip to help your orchids not only grow

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,400
vigorously but also bloom beautifully

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,400

This is a method to make natural, safe,

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:27,480
and effective fertilizer using simple

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,480
ingredients from your kitchen.

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,359
If you love orchids and want to care for

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,359
them properly, let's get started

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,359
together.

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,680
Uh to make this natural fertilizer, I

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,280
first used oranges because they contain

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,280
many nutrients that are very good for

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,280
orchids.

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,079
Peel the skin off one orange.

[Music]

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,080
Orange peels are rich in nutrients like

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,840
vitamin C, citric acid, and natural

23
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,400
essential oils, which help stimulate

24
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,400
orchid root growth, boost resistance,

25
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,200
and create a favorable environment for

26
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,200
better nutrient absorption.

27
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,400
Put the orange peel into a blender.

28
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,119
Next, I need bananas to make the natural

29
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,119
fertilizer.

[Music]

31
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,000
Banana peels are rich in potassium,

32
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,160
phosphorus, and other essential minerals

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
which help orchids grow robustly,

34
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,000
stimulate root development, and enhance

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,560
Next, add one teaspoon of baker's yeast

48
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,480
to promote fermentation, creating a

49
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,120

58
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,160

After 3 weeks, the GE mixture is ready.

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,160
The mixture has a mild, pleasant

62
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,400
beer-like aroma and a white frothy layer

63
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,120

mixture.

68
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,840
For this mixture, after opening the lid,

69
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,400
you can store it in the refrigerator for

70
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,400
up to 3 months.

71
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,160
Then dilute it with one liter of water

72
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,199
to create a natural fertilizer that is

73
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,199
very beneficial for your orchids.

75
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,319
This is a young orchid plant. You can

76
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,400
propagate it from seeds by using flower

77
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,400
stems or purchase it from e-commerce

79
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,759
Uh before transplanting it into a larger

80
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,880
pot, you need to check and remove any

81
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,880
rotten roots and damaged leaves.

82
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:39,960
Step one, soak the orchid roots in this

83
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,960
mixture for about 10 to 20 minutes.

84
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,199
This helps stimulate the growth of new

85
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,400
roots and allows the orchid to absorb

86
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,400
additional nutrients more effectively.

89
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,479
Step two, use a soft cotton ball to soak

90
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,800
the mixture and gently wipe both the top

91
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,800

92
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,800
thoroughly.

93
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,360
Uh this helps remove dust, harmful fungi

94
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:45,639
and pests from orchids while also

95
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,639
providing nutrition through the leaves.

96
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,360
Step three, transplant it into a larger

97
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,599
pot to allow the orchid to grow better

98
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,599
and faster.

99
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,720
I plant using pine bark to help retain

100
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:13,160
moisture and provide better irerration

101
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,160
for the orchid roots to grow well.

102
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,919
On top of the orchid pot, I sprinkle a

103
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,760
little moss to help retain moisture and

104
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,240
create a natural environment conducive

105
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,240

or water that has collected in the

118
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,440

126
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,839
the orchid has developed many new young

127
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,040
roots, indicating that it is growing

128
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:47,000
healthily and effectively, absorbing

129
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,000
nutrients from the mixture.

131
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,600
Uh when the orchid absorbs sufficient

132
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,680
nutrients and underos photosynthesis

133
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,600
with adequate sunlight, its leaves will

134
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,839
become greener, shinier, and stronger

135
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,839
than before.

136
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,440
Then I continue to water this fertilizer

137
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,040
mixture at the base of the orchid to

138
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,000
help the plant absorb additional

139
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,000
nutrients and grow healthily.

140
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,720
Remember to apply this mixture once

141
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,560
every 10 days. On regular days, if the

142
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,160
growing medium is dry, you only need to

143
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,160
water with plain water.

144
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,079
And then soak this mixture and continue

145
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,639
wiping both the top and bottom sides of

146
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,000
the leaves to remove dust, fungi, pests,

147
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,000
and provide nutrition through the

148
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000

149
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:29,320
Then I place the orchid pot in a in a

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,320
spot with gentle sunlight.

151
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,320
This allows the orchid to

152
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,079
photosynthesize effectively, synthesize

153
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,959

very well with large thick leaves, which

194
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,560

195
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,800
adequate nutrients and is in its

[Music]

238
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,200
After flowering, orchids often become

239
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,520
weak because they've spent a lot of

240
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,600
energy to bloom. So, we need to restore

241
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:06,520
them so that they can continue to bloom

242
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,520

243
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,240

When cutting off old flower branches,

246
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,400
the plant will focus its energy on

247
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,200
growing new branches and leaves, helping

248
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,200

Damaged leaves can harbor bacteria and

252
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,290
fungi. Pruning helps reduce the risk of

253
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,369

for bacteria and fungi causing harm to

262
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:25,720

00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,919
burning leaves, thereby providing energy

On normal days when you see the growing

387
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:39,000
medium is dry, you just need to water or

388
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,000
spray the orchid with water regularly.

The oat and ginger fertilizer I just

390
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,760
shared should only be applied every 10

391
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,760

Orchids develop many new roots.

398
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,559
New roots help the plant absorb water

399
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:22,399
and nutrients needed for growth,

00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:23,800
especially during the recovery period

resistant to harmful agents such as

New root formation often signals that

410
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,919
the plant is in active growth. um which

411
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,990
is important for flowering in the

412
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:13,409

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,720
orchid. The root system develops to the

point where the leaves are very green

role in maintaining moisture for the
