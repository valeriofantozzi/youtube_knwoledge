Welcome to my channel.

00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:11,480
If you have an orchid did that has rot

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,480

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,119

[Music]

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,879
This orchid may be suffering from

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,640
inorganic fertilizer shock leading to

11
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,180
root rot causing the leaves to turn

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:03,079

[Music]

17
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,920
Removing damaged roots helps prevent the

18
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,960
rot from spreading, causing the entire

19
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,960
root of the orchid to rot.

When planting dry, sterilized moss, it

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,639
will help absorb moisture from the

43
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,580

44
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:51,769
