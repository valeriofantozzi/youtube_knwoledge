Subscribe to the video so you don't miss any tips on my channel.

5
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:32,894
Now, let's get started.

6
00:00:35,893 --> 00:00:46,891
To make this type of organic fertilizer you need black tea (or tea grounds).

7
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:59,889
I use 3 teaspoons of black tea.

8
00:01:01,888 --> 00:01:11,886
Add 1 liter of boiled water.

9
00:01:21,884 --> 00:01:31,882
Incubate until the water cools.

10
00:01:38,881 --> 00:02:08,875
After the water cools, filter to remove sediment.

11
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:28,871
Add water to make 5 liters of black tea solution.

12
00:02:41,877 --> 00:02:56,899
Next add 1 teaspoon of baking soda.

13
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:15,895
 
FIRST METHOD

14
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:28,959
Water this fertilizer solution on the orchid roots.

15
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:46,889
Black tea contains many minerals and organic substances that help provide nutrition for orchids.

16
00:03:55,887 --> 00:04:05,885
It contains nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus,

17
00:04:06,885 --> 00:04:15,883
Important nutritional factors for orchid growth.

18
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:36,946
Baking soda (bicarbonate soda) has the ability to increase the PH level in orchid pots,

19
00:04:40,878 --> 00:04:50,876
This is helpful in reducing acidity if you use too much chemical fertilizer.

20
00:04:59,874 --> 00:05:09,872
Baking soda has the ability to kill insects and fungi that are harmful to plants.

21
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,869
SECOND METHOD

22
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:56,963
Spray this fertilizer on the entire orchid.

23
00:06:06,894 --> 00:06:16,893
This method is similar to using foliar fertilizer.

24
00:06:23,891 --> 00:06:33,889
You can use it as a natural pesticide to protect orchids from insects and diseases.

25
00:07:01,884 --> 00:07:05,883
THIRD METHOD

26
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:22,879
Clean the leaf surface with this fertilizer solution.

27
00:07:33,877 --> 00:07:45,875
The leaf surface will always be clean and the stomata will not be clogged.

28
00:07:55,873 --> 00:08:05,871
Orchids will photosynthesize better.

29
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,869
RESULT

30
00:08:19,868 --> 00:08:33,899
Plant roots are protected and supplemented with nutrients so they grow very healthily.

31
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:48,896
will help orchids absorb the most nutrients.

32
00:08:55,894 --> 00:09:05,892
Because they are provided with enough nutrition, the flowers bloom more brilliantly.

33
00:09:09,892 --> 00:09:19,890
Many flowers bloom on the same branch.

34
00:09:26,888 --> 00:09:37,220
The flowers stay on the branches for a long time before fading.

35
00:09:42,885 --> 00:09:51,883
