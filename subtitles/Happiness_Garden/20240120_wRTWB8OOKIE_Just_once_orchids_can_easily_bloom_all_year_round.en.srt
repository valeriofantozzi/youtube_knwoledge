00:00:27,366 --> 00:00:35,893
First, cut off all the yellow leaves.

5
00:00:40,892 --> 00:00:48,891
Because these yellow leaves cannot be revived.

6
00:00:57,442 --> 00:01:08,887
With these wrinkled and withered leaves, I will show you how to restore them now.

7
00:01:23,544 --> 00:01:33,882
Wash the roots with water to remove any excess organic matter.

9
00:02:22,332 --> 00:02:32,870
then take 3 liters of water.

10
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:50,900
Then take 3 tablespoons of cement to help disinfect and remove excess acid.

11
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:29,892
Wait for the water to clear before using.

12
00:03:34,398 --> 00:03:38,890
After the water clears.

13
00:03:41,205 --> 00:03:49,888

00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:52,897
Soak the orchid pot in this water for 10 minutes.

00:06:02,243 --> 00:06:12,893

22
00:07:20,204 --> 00:07:30,878
After 3 days, take 2 liters of water into the jar.

23
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:50,874
Add 3 tablespoons of rice.

24
00:08:15,856 --> 00:08:26,900
From now on, use this rice water for watering every 2 weeks.

25
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:39,898
Rice water is rich in polyphenols, calcium, magnesium, vitamins, etc.
