00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to my Happiness Garden channel.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,598
Today I continue to share how to make a free but very special fertilizer.

3
00:00:12,624 --> 00:00:20,084
Made from banana peels and rotten bananas.

4
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:28,154
But with this new way you will have a great fertilizer for orchids and other plants.

5
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:38,034
Chop finely for easier and quicker fermentation.

6
00:00:52,034 --> 00:01:01,835
After slicing, you put all the bananas in a plastic jar.

7
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:11,437
This is the yeast I usually brew with barley to make craft beer.

8
00:01:11,437 --> 00:01:19,451
I put a spoonful of brewer's yeast in the jar.

9
00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:28,691
Then add 800ml of warm water.

10
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:44,432
Stir well and incubate in a cool place for 2 weeks.

11
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,377
2 WEEKS AFTER.

12
00:01:58,377 --> 00:02:09,086
So we've got a great fertilizer.

13
00:02:11,067 --> 00:02:15,448
I filter the pulp.

14
00:02:15,448 --> 00:02:24,334
it smells like beer.

15
00:02:26,134 --> 00:02:33,915
When the last flowers have withered.

16
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:43,544
 
Cut off all flower stalks that have bloomed.

17
00:02:44,853 --> 00:02:52,464
Let me share with you how to revive from flower stalks.

18
00:03:00,361 --> 00:03:11,373
then you peel off the protective film so that this button can easily grow new buds.

19
00:03:30,282 --> 00:03:39,593
Apply toothpaste on the cut,

20
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:51,719
It will help the cut heal.

21
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:13,381
Fill the tank with 3 liters of water at room temperature.

22
00:04:13,381 --> 00:04:23,673
Add 3 tablespoons of fermented banana juice.

23
00:04:31,148 --> 00:04:40,543
Use a cotton ball soaked in water mixed with banana juice.

24
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:52,490
Then clamp in place where the buttons are likely to grow into sprouts.

25
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:03,862
 
Fermented banana juice contains many nutrients such as potassium, nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium.

26
00:05:05,493 --> 00:05:14,550
All of which have a stimulating effect on plant growth and development.

27
00:05:16,162 --> 00:05:24,623
Repeat once a week with fermented banana juice.

28
00:05:24,623 --> 00:05:32,107
On normal days, you just need to spray water to keep it moist.

29
00:05:34,531 --> 00:05:44,183
Then, you use fermented banana juice to water the orchid root.

30
00:05:46,314 --> 00:05:56,497
The potassium content in banana juice helps to strengthen and support the growth of branches and roots very well.

31
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:07,339
and nitrogen supports the process of nitrogen formation and the development of reproductive organs of the plant.

32
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:20,466
Fertilize periodically once every 2 weeks for spreading roots.

33
00:06:22,135 --> 00:06:32,467
Soaking in fermented banana juice for 30 minutes each time will be very good.

34
00:06:32,467 --> 00:06:39,813
Helps reduce the onset of disease.

35
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:53,401
With leaves: you also use fermented banana juice to spray the whole plant.

36
00:06:53,401 --> 00:07:00,001
Apply 1-2 times per month.

37
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:04,096
1 MONTH LATER.

38
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:17,839
There are many shoots growing from the nodes.

39
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:32,093
The sprouts that sprout and take root immediately.

40
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:51,141
With this flower stalk, both young shoots and flower buds develop.

41
00:08:15,512 --> 00:08:25,339
And this flower stalk has revived very large flower buds.

42
00:08:26,983 --> 00:08:35,445
This flower branch is smeared with fermented banana juice,

43
00:08:35,445 --> 00:08:42,414
the flower stays fresh for a long time.

44
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:55,059
 
Fermented banana juice has properties equivalent to the natural fermentation medium.

45
00:08:55,822 --> 00:09:05,304
When used as a fertilizer, it helps to improve soil structure and the plant's ability to absorb nutrients.

46
00:09:06,092 --> 00:09:14,128
The enhanced ability to absorb nutrients helps plants grow stronger,

47
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:24,076
and absorb maximum nutrients from the soil.

48
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:32,734
Hope the video helps you a lot.

49
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:38,734
