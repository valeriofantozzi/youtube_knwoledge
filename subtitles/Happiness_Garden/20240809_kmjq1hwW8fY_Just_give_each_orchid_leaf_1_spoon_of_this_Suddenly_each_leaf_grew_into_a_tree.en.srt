00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:33,894
Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:43,892
This orchid pot has rot disease.

3
00:01:08,253 --> 00:01:16,885
and the leaves also wither.

4
00:01:16,885 --> 00:01:26,883
When leaves wilt, the cause may be due to damaged roots and not absorbing enough water, leading to wilted leaves.

5
00:01:26,883 --> 00:01:36,881
And you see these roots have rotted due to waterlogging.

6
00:01:53,878 --> 00:02:03,876
Cut off all rotten roots.

7
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:36,869
then rinse.

8
00:02:45,626 --> 00:02:55,899
Take 1 clove of garlic.

9
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:19,894
Then puree with 500ml of water.

10
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:46,889
Filter out residue.

11
00:03:48,888 --> 00:03:56,887
Add water to make 2 liters of garlic water.

12
00:04:04,394 --> 00:04:10,884
Step 1: Clean the leaves thoroughly with garlic water.

13
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:26,881
Garlic juice helps eliminate fungal diseases and harmful insects.

14
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:48,877
Step 2: Soak orchid roots in garlic water for 10 minutes.

15
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:10,872
Then take it out and put it in a jar.

16
00:05:11,872 --> 00:05:20,870
Pour in water.

17
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:28,869
Keep the water level at this position.

18
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:43,899
Place on the windowsill or under a sunshade for orchids.

19
00:05:48,898 --> 00:05:51,897
1 WEEK LATER.

20
00:05:51,897 --> 00:05:58,896
Take 1 liter of water.

21
00:06:02,177 --> 00:06:08,894
Take 1 spoon of rice.

22
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:38,888
Soak orchid roots in rice water for 20 minutes.

23
00:06:46,887 --> 00:06:55,885
Then take it out and put it in a jar.

24
00:06:55,885 --> 00:07:05,883
Pour in water.

25
00:07:06,883 --> 00:07:16,881
From now on, soak orchid roots in rice water once a week.

26
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,878
3 weeks later.

27
00:07:33,016 --> 00:07:41,876
Orchid leaves are sturdy and less likely to wilt.

28
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:54,873
New roots grow a lot, helping the orchid quickly recover withered leaves.

29
00:08:10,187 --> 00:08:20,868
I continue to take 1 spoon of rice mixed with rice water to take care of the orchids.

30
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:43,897
Continue soaking orchid roots in rice water once a week.

31
00:08:48,673 --> 00:08:56,894
After 20 minutes, take it out and put it in a jar.

32
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:19,890
3 MONTHS LATER.

33
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:32,887
So with this simple method, after only 3 months the orchid has recovered and grown very healthy.

34
00:09:33,887 --> 00:09:42,885
Both roots, leaves and flowers grow strongly.

35
00:09:43,885 --> 00:09:50,883
If you find the video good, please subscribe to my support channel.

36
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:59,882
And share so more people know this orchid care tip.

37
00:10:01,556 --> 00:10:03,556
 

38
00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:40,874
You see that this orchid has rotted and only has 1 leaf left.

39
00:10:44,873 --> 00:10:54,871
The tree is very weak, the leaves are even damaged by worms.

40
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:09,868
The roots have been damaged by rot.

41
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:31,897
Therefore, it is necessary to remove all rotten stains.

42
00:11:39,895 --> 00:11:48,893
Then rinse with water.

43
00:11:55,892 --> 00:12:02,891
Dry wipe.

44
00:12:25,886 --> 00:12:33,885
Then take 1 teaspoon of green tea.

45
00:12:42,883 --> 00:12:52,881
Pour in 1 liter of boiled water.

46
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,879
Wait until the water cools.

47
00:13:08,878 --> 00:13:18,876
Then take 3 spoons of rice.

48
00:13:24,874 --> 00:13:31,873
Pour in 1 liter of water at room temperature.

49
00:13:31,873 --> 00:13:39,871
and soak for 1 hour so that the flower nutrients are completely dissolved in the water.

50
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,869
1 Hour Later.

51
00:13:51,869 --> 00:14:01,867
Filter out residue.

52
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:18,897
Clean the orchid branches with green tea.

53
00:14:18,897 --> 00:14:29,895
Helps eliminate pests and diseases of orchids.

54
00:14:45,892 --> 00:14:52,890
Take dry moss and put it in a jar.

55
00:14:54,890 --> 00:15:03,888
Pour in green tea and steep for 30 minutes.

56
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:50,879
Soaking orchid branches for 30 minutes helps the plant quickly germinate and take root

57
00:16:19,873 --> 00:16:29,871
Then take the moss out and press it tightly into the basket.

58
00:16:47,868 --> 00:16:52,900
Pour water into the jar.

59
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:05,897
Control the water level in this position so that the moss always maintains appropriate humidity.

60
00:17:08,897 --> 00:17:18,895
Then create a hole and plant the orchid in.

61
00:17:46,889 --> 00:17:56,887
From now on, spray this rice water on the orchid branches once a week.

62
00:17:59,887 --> 00:18:09,885
Cover with a transparent glass jar.

63
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:21,882
Place on the windowsill or under a sun filter for orchids.

64
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,880
3 Weeks Later.

65
00:19:03,874 --> 00:19:12,872
The orchid has taken root.

66
00:19:32,868 --> 00:19:42,900
The roots are very strong so the tree will revive very quickly.

67
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:52,898
Then plant and do not cover but let the orchids grow in the outside environment.

68
00:20:08,894 --> 00:20:18,892
In this video, I continue to share how to help flower branches continue to revive and bloom after blooming.

69
00:20:19,892 --> 00:20:26,891

70
00:20:26,891 --> 00:20:32,890
share so more people know this tip for growing orchids.

71
00:20:39,888 --> 00:20:50,886
These are the branches after the flowers have faded.

72
00:20:51,886 --> 00:21:05,883
But these buttons can continue to bloom if you know how to care for them.

73
00:21:07,883 --> 00:21:28,879
This node has bloomed so it should be cut off.

74
00:22:05,871 --> 00:22:15,869
Then sprinkle cinnamon powder on the cut to help it dry quickly and prevent disease.

75
00:22:26,867 --> 00:22:36,898
Then leave it for 1 day without watering until the cut is dry.

76
00:22:46,896 --> 00:22:56,894
Take 1 onion and cut it into thin slices.

77
00:23:22,889 --> 00:23:32,887
Take 2 eggshells and crush them.

78
00:23:38,886 --> 00:23:48,884
Egg shells contain a lot of calcium and minerals that are very beneficial for flower growth.

79
00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:22,877
Add 2 liters of water and bring to a boil.

80
00:24:26,877 --> 00:24:36,875
Incubate until the water cools.

81
00:24:46,873 --> 00:24:56,871
After the water cools, filter to remove residue.

82
00:25:07,869 --> 00:25:10,868
First step.

83
00:25:13,867 --> 00:25:23,899
Water the orchid roots with onion and eggshell soaking water once a week.

84
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:38,896
Helps orchids develop roots and germinate quickly.

85
00:25:41,895 --> 00:25:45,894
Step 2.

86
00:25:46,894 --> 00:25:56,892
Spray this water on the leaves once a week.

87
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:09,890
Helps supplement nutrients through leaves, helping leaves stay green.

88
00:26:16,888 --> 00:26:25,886
At the same time, it repels harmful insects and increases pest resistance.

89
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:30,885
STep 3.

90
00:26:36,884 --> 00:26:46,882
Roll cotton onto the button to stimulate flowers.

91
00:27:45,871 --> 00:27:55,869
Then spray the water soaked in onions and eggshells onto this cotton pad.

92
00:27:55,869 --> 00:28:05,900
This water will help stimulate flowering very quickly.

93
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:16,898
Do it once a week.

94
00:28:20,897 --> 00:28:30,895
After incubating the cotton for about 30 minutes, we take the cotton out.

95
00:28:42,893 --> 00:28:50,891
Then take the orchid pot out of this water and remember to spray water on weekdays to keep the orchid pot moist.

96
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:59,889
1 MONTH LATER.

97
00:29:03,888 --> 00:29:13,886
Old orchid branches continue to grow new shoots.

98
00:29:18,885 --> 00:29:28,883
This helps orchids bloom many times a year.

99
00:29:36,882 --> 00:29:46,880
Each batch blooms many beautiful, colorful flowers

100
00:29:52,879 --> 00:29:59,877
Hope the video helps you a lot.

101
00:30:15,874 --> 00:31:26,893
Thank you for watching the video. Good luck and see you in the next videos.
