12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,119

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,480
To make this fertilizer, we only need to

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,800
prepare two cloves of garlic, a simple

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,710
but extremely effective ingredient for

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,520
orchids.

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,359
Um, with its natural antibacterial

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,040
properties, garlic not only protects the

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,420
roots but also helps orchids grow

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:14,240
vigorously.

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,720
Cut the garlic into small pieces so that

29
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,360
when fermenting, the nutrients in the

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:25,080
garlic can easily dissolve and maximize

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,680

The next ingredient that everyone is

43
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,599
familiar with is bread. An everyday

44
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,380
food, but extremely useful when making

45
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:21,520
fertilizer for orchids.

53
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,680
Next, we need dry yeast. The type of

54
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,220
yeast you usually use to bake bread at

[Music]

57
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,959
When fermenting, dry yeast produces

58
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,920
beneficial microorganisms, helping the

59
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,920
fermentation process proceed faster and

60
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,920
enriching the nutrients in the natural

fermentation process will start quickly.

[Music]

66
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,840
Next, we will use molasses, an

67
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,000
ingredient that not only provides

68
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,000
nutrients for beneficial microorganisms,

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,830
but also directly supplies nutrients to

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:18,930
the orchids.

74
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,880
next fermentation step.

76
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,639
When pouring the water, leave some space

77
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,120
at the top to allow the gas produced

78
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,440
during fermentation to escape easily and

79
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,840
safely.

80
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,759
Next, gently stir the mixture, helping

81
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,600
the ingredients dissolve completely and

82
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,840
the microorganisms grow better.

83
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,080
After stirring well, close the jar and

84
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,320
place it in a cool ventilated area for 2

85
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,960
weeks to allow the fermentation process

86
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,960
to complete perfectly.

87
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,360
After 2 weeks of fermentation, the

88
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,880
beneficial microorganisms have fully

89
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,039

101
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,840
The first method, water each orchid pot

102
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,400

103
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,080

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,080

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,840
Gently water the roots in growing

beneficial microorganisms, helping the

Thanks to the abundant nutrients, the

116
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,199
orchid quickly sprouts new shoots. Its

117
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,039
leaves become lush green and it gets

118
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,550

Do this twice a month, alternating with

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,360
regular watering, so the plant always

123
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,060

the solution makes them lush and shiny

141
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,599
The fermented garlic mixture has natural

the aerial roots to grow faster uh

148
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,880

149
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,880
to absorb moisture and nutrients.

150
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,120
Uh when sprayed regularly, the orchid

151
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,279
will have better resistance, be less

soak the entire orchid pot in the

layer of dust that has built up over
