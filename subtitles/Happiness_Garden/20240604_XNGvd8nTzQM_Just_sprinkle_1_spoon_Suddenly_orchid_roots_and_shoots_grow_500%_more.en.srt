00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,899
Hello everyone, to easily care for orchids to always grow healthily.

2
00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:15,897
A healthy root system helps absorb the most nutrients.

3
00:00:15,897 --> 00:00:22,896
and have more flower buds, flowers stay on the branches longer.

4
00:00:24,103 --> 00:00:30,894
These are coffee grounds.

5
00:00:31,894 --> 00:00:42,892
I took about 50 grams of coffee grounds and put them in a jar

6
00:00:48,891 --> 00:00:56,889
When eating bananas, don't throw away the peel.

7
00:00:57,889 --> 00:01:05,887
Because banana peels contain many nutrients, especially organic potassium.

8
00:01:06,887 --> 00:01:14,886
Very good for the growth of buds, flowers and has anti-drought effects.

9
00:01:16,885 --> 00:01:25,883
I cut the banana peel thinly and put it in a jar.

10
00:01:31,882 --> 00:01:40,881
Then add 3 tablespoons of sugar.

11
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:46,909
Sugar helps nourish beneficial microorganisms.

12
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:58,877
and add 3 tablespoons of dry yeast to help decompose organic matter quickly and not rot.

13
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:11,874
And add 1 liter of warm water.

14
00:02:14,874 --> 00:02:24,872
Warm water helps beneficial microorganisms grow and ferment faster than cold water.

15
00:02:28,308 --> 00:02:36,869
Then place in a cool place for 21 days to let the organic matter decompose before using.

16
00:02:43,282 --> 00:02:53,899
with orchids with wilted leaves and slow growth.

17
00:02:53,899 --> 00:03:03,734
I take care of it with organic fertilizer from coffee grounds and banana peels and it will be very good.

18
00:03:10,713 --> 00:03:20,894
Checking the roots, I found that this orchid had many damaged roots underneath.

19
00:03:20,894 --> 00:03:29,892
The cause may be that the growing medium is moldy and dry.

20
00:03:31,736 --> 00:03:40,890
All damaged roots need to be removed.

21
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:52,888
Then rinse with water.

22
00:03:57,887 --> 00:04:06,885
I replanted the orchid with a more porous growing medium, which helps retain moisture better.

23
00:04:26,638 --> 00:04:34,879
After composting, the compost ferments so there is a white scum on top.

24
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:46,877
I took 50ml of this organic nutrient.

25
00:05:00,874 --> 00:05:09,872
Mix with 3 liters of water.

26
00:05:11,181 --> 00:05:13,872
Step 1

27
00:05:17,871 --> 00:05:27,869
Wiping the top and bottom of leaves with this water helps kill fungi and insects that harm orchids.

28
00:05:32,868 --> 00:05:42,899
Do this every 2 weeks to protect your orchids.

29
00:05:49,913 --> 00:05:52,897
Step 2

30
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:06,894
Use this water to spray the leaves once a week.

31
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:17,892
Helps supplement nutrients through leaves very effectively.

32
00:06:21,058 --> 00:06:29,890
Helps leaves recover quickly, orchid leaves will be strong and healthy quickly

33
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,889
Step 3

34
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:41,888
Water each orchid pot with this water once a week.

35
00:06:44,887 --> 00:06:52,885
This fertilizer provides potassium, an important mineral that improves plant health and vitality.

36
00:06:53,885 --> 00:07:02,883
The beneficial fungus Mycorrhiza will grow to help the plant more easily absorb nutrients from the orchid growing medium.

37
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:11,882
Soak in this water for 10 minutes then take out.

38
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:24,879
Place in a cool place with enough light for the orchid to recover.

39
00:07:29,063 --> 00:07:32,877
2 MONTHS LATER

40
00:07:38,088 --> 00:07:46,208
Many new roots develop to help the orchid absorb nutrients better.

41
00:07:48,874 --> 00:07:58,872
When the roots absorb enough water and nutrients, the orchid will recover faster.

42
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:07,871
Thanks to that, the leaves have completely recovered and are no longer wilted.

43
00:08:10,332 --> 00:08:19,868
I continue to wash the leaves with this water once a week.

44
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:35,898
Then continue to spray this water on the orchid once a week.

45
00:08:41,204 --> 00:08:51,895
and continue watering and soaking the roots once a week with this water.

46
00:09:25,402 --> 00:09:27,888
After the next 2 months.

47
00:09:29,768 --> 00:09:36,886
The orchid has completely recovered and is growing very strongly.

48
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:43,885
It blooms many flower buds.

49
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:50,884
Roots grow very healthy.

Next, I share the secret to quick recovery for orchids with yellow and wilted leaves.

52
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:55,871
Cut off all damaged roots and yellow leaves.

53
00:11:14,867 --> 00:11:28,898
I use aloe vera leaves to restore growth and reactivate this orchid.

54
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:45,894
Aloe vera gel contains essential vitamins, amino acids, and minerals to help spread recovery quickly.

55
00:11:45,894 --> 00:12:00,891
Aloe vera gel is also a very good natural antiseptic. It helps to eliminate fungal diseases for orchids very quickly.

56
00:16:21,873 --> 00:16:39,869
Place the orchid in a sunny spot or by a window. Do not leave the orchid in a place with direct sunlight because the sun will make it easy to rot.

57
00:16:39,869 --> 00:16:55,900
AFTER 1 WEEK

58
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:07,897
new roots grow

59
00:17:07,897 --> 00:17:15,896
there is a new seedling growing

60
00:17:22,894 --> 00:17:29,893
There's a new one growing here

61
00:17:36,892 --> 00:17:44,890
AFTER 2 MONTHS

62
00:17:54,888 --> 00:18:02,886
have lots of healthy roots growing
