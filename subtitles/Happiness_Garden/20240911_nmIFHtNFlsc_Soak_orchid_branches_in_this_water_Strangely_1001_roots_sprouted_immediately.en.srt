00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:30,894
Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:33,894 --> 00:00:43,892
These orchids were about to die so they threw them away.

3
00:00:50,890 --> 00:01:00,888
This plant still has green leaves so I brought it home to restore.

4
00:01:10,886 --> 00:01:20,884
It is necessary to remove all old planting material and examine the root system.

5
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:33,882
Cut off all damaged roots.

6
00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:11,874
Then rinse with water.

7
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:50,900
I took the outer skin of the onion.

8
00:03:02,898 --> 00:03:12,896
Put onion peels in a jar and soak in 2 liters of boiled water.

9
00:03:19,894 --> 00:03:29,892
Then brew until the water cools.

10
00:03:32,892 --> 00:03:42,890
Next I recycled the plastic box into a tool to revive orchids.

11
00:04:36,807 --> 00:04:51,876
After the water cools, filter to remove sediment.

12
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:07,873
Soak moss in onion water for 30 minutes.

13
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:28,869
Clean the leaves with onion juice.

14
00:05:29,868 --> 00:05:39,900
This helps eliminate fungi and bacteria that cause rot in orchids.

15
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:54,897
Soak orchids in onion water for 30 minutes to help stimulate root growth.

16
00:06:12,893 --> 00:06:22,891
Take a few pebbles and place them at the bottom of the box.

17
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:35,889
Then spread moss on top of the gravel layer.

18
00:06:59,884 --> 00:07:09,882
Plug the orchid into the box.

19
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:26,879
Pour some water into this plastic box.

20
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:35,235
The water level is only allowed to reach this point.

21
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:50,874
Then place the orchid in this water container.

22
00:07:57,893 --> 00:08:02,872
Cover with vented lid on top.

23
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:15,869
This way you won't need to water and the orchid will still have enough moisture.

24
00:08:23,867 --> 00:08:28,900
ONE MONTH LATER.

25
00:08:52,895 --> 00:08:55,894
WOW

26
00:09:00,893 --> 00:09:10,891
From an orchid with no roots, it was revived and developed many strong roots.

27
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:29,888
When the roots are strong, they will absorb nutrients and water to help the orchid recover very quickly.

28
00:09:35,886 --> 00:09:45,884
Now the orchid can be planted in a pot so it can grow in an outdoor environment.

29
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:55,882
