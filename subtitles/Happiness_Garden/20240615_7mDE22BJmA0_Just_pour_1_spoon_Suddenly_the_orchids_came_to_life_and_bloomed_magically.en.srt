Welcome to my channel

2
00:00:31,894 --> 00:00:41,892
If you have a rotten orchid like this, don't rush to throw it away

3
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:51,057
For this video I will share how to restore rotten orchids that grow very quickly

4
00:00:53,570 --> 00:01:03,555
First, remove all damaged leaves and roots.

5
00:01:55,551 --> 00:02:05,542
Then rinse with water to help eliminate fungi and bacteria that cause orchid rot

6
00:02:32,863 --> 00:02:42,835
Use a small aloe vera leaf to have antiseptic properties

7
00:02:47,937 --> 00:02:57,932
In addition, aloe vera leaves also contain many important amino acids and nutrients.

8
00:02:57,932 --> 00:03:06,764
Promotes rapid growth of orchids

9
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:26,893
Add 1 liter of water

10
00:03:45,223 --> 00:03:55,221
Add 1 teaspoon of honey which has antiseptic properties and provides nutrients and vitamins

11
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:15,317
Leave for 2 hours before using

12
00:04:19,747 --> 00:04:22,715
2 Haurs later

13
00:04:55,331 --> 00:05:05,307
Soak orchid roots in aloe vera and honey for 20 minutes

14
00:05:12,397 --> 00:05:22,370
Use aloe vera juice and honey to thoroughly wipe the top and bottom of the leaves

15
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:33,001
Helps eliminate fungal diseases and insects that harm orchids

16
00:05:37,135 --> 00:05:46,132
Cleaning stomata helps photosynthetic light spread better

17
00:05:48,898 --> 00:05:56,896
Therefore, the leaves will always be sturdy and naturally shiny green

18
00:06:00,657 --> 00:06:10,627
Then use this aloe vera and honey water to water the orchid roots

19
00:06:17,938 --> 00:06:26,924
Doing this twice a month helps stimulate the orchid to grow new roots

20
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:35,581
and protect orchid roots from root rot

21
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:50,919
Use dry pine bark as a growing medium for orchids

22
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:13,881
Plant the orchid in a new pot

23
00:07:27,048 --> 00:07:36,044
Leave for 3 days without watering to help the wound heal quickly

24
00:07:36,044 --> 00:07:39,357
3 Days Later

25
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:52,874
Adding a layer of moss on the surface helps keep the orchid moist

26
00:07:57,873 --> 00:08:07,871
From now on, water once a week or when the surface of the orchid pot is dry, you need to water the orchid pot.

27
00:08:31,942 --> 00:08:41,930
Utilize recycled plastic bottles to create miniature greenhouses to grow orchids

28
00:08:57,923 --> 00:09:01,893
1 MONTH LATER

29
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:20,889
The small orchid has grown very healthy

30
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:33,920
Take 3 spoons of rice

31
00:09:37,685 --> 00:09:43,652
1 Liter of water

32
00:09:56,463 --> 00:10:06,447
Water the orchid with rice water every 2 weeks

33
00:10:12,635 --> 00:10:22,611
Rice water helps stimulate growth and adds many nutrients to help baby orchids grow quickly

34
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:57,337
Spray a moisturizing mist with water when the surface feels dry

35
00:11:14,794 --> 00:11:18,766
2 MONTHS LATER

36
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:34,430
The small orchid has developed healthy roots, stems and leaves

37
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:44,428
Hopefully the video will help you a lot in taking better care of orchids at home.
