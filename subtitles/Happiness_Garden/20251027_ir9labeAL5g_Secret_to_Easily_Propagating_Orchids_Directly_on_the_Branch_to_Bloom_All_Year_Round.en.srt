00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,680
Welcome to my channel. Today I will

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,680
share a very exciting secret. How to

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,840
propagate orchids right on the branch

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,770
while still helping the plant bloom all

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,990
year round easily.

00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,990
[Music]

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,519
Uh this orchid has just finished its

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,240
flowering season and the last petals

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,400
have also fallen. This is the ideal time

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,880
to cut the flower spike, preparing for

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,880
branch propagation.

[Music]

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,800
If done at the right time, the plant

14
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,640
will quickly recover and start producing

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,120
healthy new shoots ready for the next

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,800
flowering season. Proper care from this

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,559
stage will help you maximize the

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,910
orchid's ability to bloom all year

19
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,010
round.

20
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,010
[Music]

21
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,680
We should only propagate from buds that

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,079
have not yet bloomed like this because

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,879
inside the bud there are still potential

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,960
dormant shoots. Choosing the right bud

25
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,040
greatly increases the chances of new

26
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,760
shoots and flowering from the cut

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,000
branch.

28
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,760
Buds that have already bloomed should be

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,560
cut off immediately because they no

30
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:20,280
longer contain dormant shoots and cannot

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,280
produce new growth.

[Music]

35
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,439
You should spray alcohol on the tools

36
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,520
before cutting to disinfect them. Then

37
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,159
trim the cut again to remove any crushed

38
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,560
parts. This helps reduce the risk of the

39
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,960
cutting rotting while also creating

40
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,079
conditions for the new orchid branch to

41
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,000
grow healthily. Just a small step, but

42
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,119
extremely important to ensure a high

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,119
survival rate for the cutting.

47
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,920
Next, gently peel off the outer

48
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,080
protective layer of the dormant bud.

49
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,800
This step allows the bud to come into

50
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,560
direct contact with air and nutrients,

51
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,800
thereby stimulating the new chute to

52
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,800
grow quickly.

Handle carefully to avoid damaging the

56
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,159
bud as this is the most important part

57
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,159
that determines the success of the

58
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,159
cutting.

[Music]

61
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,519
On this mother plant, there is one leaf

62
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,519
that has been infected with fungus. So,

63
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,840
I carefully cut off the diseased parts

64
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,840
of the leaf.

65
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,840
Timely removal not only helps prevent

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,320
the fungus from spreading to healthy

67
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,639
parts, but also allows the mother plant

68
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,010
to focus its nutrients on nurturing new

69
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:34,639
healthy shoots and leaves.

71
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,560
Now we will prepare a special fertilizer

72
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,080
to restore the mother orchid and

73
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,240
stimulate the young orchid to grow

74
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,720
vigorously during branch propagation.

[Music]

76
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,560
First, take a fresh clove of garlic. A

77
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,640
simple ingredient, but extremely

78
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,720
effective.

79
00:04:53,640 --> 00:05:00,479
[Music]

80
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,040
Garlic not only provides natural

81
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,199
antibacterial properties but also

82
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,199
stimulates roots and new shoots to grow

83
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,199
healthily.

84
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,160
The next ingredient, prepare a small

85
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,240
aloe vera leaf because aloe vera

86
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,560
contains many nutrients and natural

87
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,560
growth stimulants.

88
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,840
When combined with garlic, this mixture

89
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,479
will help the mother orchid recover

90
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,919
quickly and promote the flower spike

91
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,320
along with the cutting to grow

92
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:32,360
healthily, laying the foundation for

93
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,360
vibrant flowers in the future.

94
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,000
Next, add 300 ml of water to the garlic

95
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,520
and aloe vera leaf.

96
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,320
Then, blend the mixture until all the

97
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,320
nutrients are fully dissolved.

After blending, strain out the residue,

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,400
keeping only the nutrient-rich solution.

102
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,639
This step helps the fertilizer penetrate

103
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,560
deeper into the roots and flower spike

104
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,319
while also preventing clogging or root

105
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,479
rot when watering the mother plant and

106
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,479
the cutting.

Next, pour the filtered fertilizer

109
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,440
mixture into a small cup and soak the

110
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,440
cutting for about 20 minutes.

111
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,720
This soaking helps the cutting fully

112
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,199
absorb nutrients, stimulates roots and

113
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,600
new shoots to grow faster, and increases

114
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,840
the survival rate of the cutting. This

115
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,590
is an important step to ensure that each

116
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,800
cutting has a healthy start.

vigorous growth.

126
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,160
Ginger has mild antibacterial

127
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,080
properties, while aloe vera provides

128
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,919
many growth stimulants, helping the

129
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,240
plant become healthy with green leaves

130
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:53,420

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,680
When the plant receives nutrients and

136
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,919
natural growth stimulants, it responds

137
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,360
better to environmental changes,

194
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,519
This helps the new chute grow in the

195
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,560
right direction while the orchid roots

196
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,959
quickly attach to the medium.

197
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,360
You can also lightly mist some water to

198
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:48,000
keep the cutting moist immediately after

199
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,279
placing it in the medium.

201
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,480
Then use a plastic cup with holes around

202
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,560
and place it over the propagation pot.

203
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,480
This cup helps maintain stable humidity

204
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,839
for the cutting while also ensuring good

205
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,839
air circulation and preventing mold.

206
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,480
Next, place the cutting pot in a spot

207
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,160
with gentle sunlight so the plant

208
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,760
receives enough light without being too

209
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,680
harsh.

210
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,390

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:57,320
young chute sprout and produce new

223
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,600
Uh this is clear evidence that with just

224
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:17,800
a few simple yet scientific steps, you

225
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,800
can easily propagate orchids.

226
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,720
Since the young orchids have not yet

227
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,279
produced any roots, you need to continue

228
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,880
caring for them and maintaining moisture

229
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,040
carefully until the roots develop

230
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,040
healthily before planting them in a new

231
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,040

233
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,480
We need to change the water once a week

234
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,959
to keep the cutting environment clean.

235
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,200
This helps prevent mold, bacteria, and

236
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,279
root rot while also ensuring that the

237
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:52,240
young orchids continuously absorb

238
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:55,560
nutrients and develop healthy roots and

239
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,560
new shoots.

240
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,920

265
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,240
I choose a pot with drainage holes and a

266
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,120
medium of pine bark that has been

267
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,639
treated for fungi to plant the orchids.

268
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,120
This ensures that water does not

269
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,519
stagnate. The roots receive sufficient

270
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,079
air and do not rot, while the clean

271
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,079
medium helps the plants grow healthily,

272
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,000

273
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:39,000

surrounded by the medium so the plant is

281
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:11,160
