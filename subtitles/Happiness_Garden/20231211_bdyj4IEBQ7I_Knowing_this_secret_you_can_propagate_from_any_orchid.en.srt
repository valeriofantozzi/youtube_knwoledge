Hello friends.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,617
In my hand is a wilted orchid branch.

3
00:00:06,617 --> 00:00:10,653
And in this video I will share so that you can propagate from any orchid branch.

4
00:00:14,366 --> 00:00:19,363
We cut off the spots that have bloomed.

5
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:36,434
Just keep these 3 paragraphs can still sprout.

6
00:00:40,451 --> 00:00:46,536
Applying candle solution on the cut will help protect the orchid from rot.

7
00:01:29,543 --> 00:01:36,945
Peel off the protective film of the sleeping sprout.

8
00:02:02,517 --> 00:02:09,534
Use 1 sprig of chopped fresh ginger.

9
00:02:25,486 --> 00:02:30,661
500 ml of boiled water.

10
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:32,845
wait 1 day.

11
00:02:52,028 --> 00:02:57,300
Soak orchids in ginger water for 30 minutes.

12
00:03:05,324 --> 00:03:10,934
Soak moss in ginger water for 30 minutes.

13
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:41,954
I use recycled plastic boxes to make miniature greenhouses to help propagate orchids faster.

14
00:03:45,328 --> 00:03:50,413
There's a vent here.

15
00:04:06,934 --> 00:04:12,821
Put the orchid in a miniature greenhouse and spray it with moisture once a week.

16
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:22,407
Place in a bright place and avoid direct sunlight.

17
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:25,001
21 DAYS AFTER.

18
00:04:55,801 --> 00:05:04,486
Continue misting to keep moisture and keep in a light place, avoid direct sunlight.

19
00:05:08,338 --> 00:05:11,634
AFTER 1O NEXT DAY.

20
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:43,367
Continue misting to keep moisture and keep in a light place, avoid direct sunlight.

21
00:05:45,535 --> 00:05:49,880
AFTER 2 NEXT WEEKS.

22
00:06:37,405 --> 00:06:44,425
Plant in pots to let the orchid adapt and grow in the outside environment.

23
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:27,835

My videos have subtitles in different languages. Please select the appropriate language to understand the video content clearly.

25
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:48,322
Remember to plant the root higher than the pot so that the orchid does not have root rot.

26
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:53,794
That's all I want to share with you in this video.

27
00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:59,067
Now goodbye and see you in the next videos.
