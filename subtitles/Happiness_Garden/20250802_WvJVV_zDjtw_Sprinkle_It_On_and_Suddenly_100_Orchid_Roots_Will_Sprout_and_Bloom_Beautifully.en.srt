Uh, you see here a withered orchid.

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,879
Perhaps it's because they haven't been

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:45,320
watered regularly or because direct

13
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,320

Nice to meet you on my channel.

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,279
You see here a withered orchid. Maybe

199
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,639
it's because you didn't water it or due

200
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,639
to direct sunlight shining on the

201
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,639

This aloe vera gel is great for reviving

217
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,280

231
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,040
Next, take one liter of warm water and

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:28,080
put it in the bottle.

234
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,760
Then take one spoon of rice and soak it

235
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,520
in this water for about 30 minutes. Let

236
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,400

237
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,400

239
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,760

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,050
filter out residue. Then add 2 L of

256
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:49,000
Cover the pot with moss to retain

257
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,000
moisture better.

259
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,000
Now you use the solution to water the

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:28,669

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,240
After soaking for 2 hours, remember to

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:54,520
lift the orchid pot and place it in a

nutrients from the roots to the stem.

279
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,520
If the leaves are provided with enough

280
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,080
water and nutrients from the roots, the

281
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:17,709

288
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,679
after the next two months,

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,840
the orchid has grown two branches, two

291
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,799
But the leaves at the base have turned

292
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:43,799

293
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,799

[Music]

295
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,960
uh instinctively when an orchid buds, if

296
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,799
the plant lacks nutrients, the the base

297
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,400
leaves will turn yellow and fall off to

298
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:03,400

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,400
develop.

300
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,200
Now I need to supplement the orchid's

301
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,010

302
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:30,559
