00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to my channel

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,531
This is a wilted orchid that people throw away

3
00:00:13,892 --> 00:00:19,863
wilted, wrinkled leaves

4
00:00:36,523 --> 00:00:42,492
Orchid has all its roots damaged

5
00:00:51,525 --> 00:00:57,522
I will remove all damaged roots

6
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:23,184
Cut out all the flowers

7
00:01:25,524 --> 00:01:33,515
Rinse thoroughly under running water

8
00:01:43,935 --> 00:01:49,912
Remove infected leaves

9
00:02:04,743 --> 00:02:12,741
Sprinkle cinnamon powder on the freshly cut wound and sprinkle on the root

10
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:26,938
Cinnamon powder helps wounds dry quickly and kills fungi

11
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:40,569
Soak 5 tablespoons of rice in 500ml of water at room temperature

12
00:02:53,809 --> 00:03:01,786
Stir well and wait 30 minutes for the nutrients to mix into the water

13
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:13,396
Use the shells of 5 poultry eggs soaked in 500ml of boiled water

14
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:38,808
Close the lid and wait 2 hours for the nutrients to mix into the water

15
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:48,994
Decant the water inside to wash the leaves

16
00:03:51,254 --> 00:03:57,254
Rice water helps to get rid of fungi and insects

17
00:03:58,576 --> 00:04:05,381
At the same time, rice water also contains many vitamins, amino acids and minerals such as:

18
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:11,327
vitamins A, B, E and natural protein, phosphorus, potassium

19
00:04:13,736 --> 00:04:19,716
will help spread the recovery quickly

20
00:04:30,953 --> 00:04:37,124
I grow orchids with gravel and moss

21
00:05:25,777 --> 00:05:32,121
Mix rice water with water to soak egg shells

22
00:05:41,173 --> 00:05:49,144
The combination of eggshell and rice water will create special nutrients

23
00:06:07,843 --> 00:06:14,201
The combination of eggshell and rice water will create special nutrients

24
00:06:30,818 --> 00:06:35,738
Place the orchid pot in a cool place, out of direct sunlight

25
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,320
2 months later

26
00:06:45,858 --> 00:06:49,311
Lan has grown 2 new leaves

27
00:06:50,616 --> 00:06:56,384
2 old leaves are still wilted at first

28
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:11,079
The orchid has grown a lot of new roots

29
00:07:12,406 --> 00:07:18,381
Strong roots will help the plant absorb enough water and nutrients

30
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:25,774
Only then will the withered leaves be restored and become lush

31
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:32,389
here orchids have buds

32
00:07:37,683 --> 00:07:43,466
Here is another big bud

33
00:07:44,853 --> 00:07:51,341
From now on, take care of it like any other normal orchid

34
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:58,872
That's all I want to share in this video

35
00:08:00,872 --> 00:08:05,871
