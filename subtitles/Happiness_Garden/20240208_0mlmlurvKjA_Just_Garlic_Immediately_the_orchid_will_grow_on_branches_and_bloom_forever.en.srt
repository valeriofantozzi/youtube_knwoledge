00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,033
Hello friends

2
00:00:02,033 --> 00:00:05,951
When the new orchid wither all flowers

3
00:00:05,951 --> 00:00:11,314
This is the best time to cut flowers to help them sprout faster

4
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:18,997
Which country are you watching this video from? Please comment below. 

5
00:00:18,997 --> 00:00:24,896
It's so great that we can chat with each other from all around the world!

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,894
Peel off the protective film so that the buds will germinate faster

7
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:55,323
Cut back the branch with a sharp knife so as not to crush the cut

8
00:01:22,427 --> 00:01:28,416
Pour melted candle solution into the cut to help the cut heal quickly and not rot

9
00:01:38,395 --> 00:01:46,379
Sprinkle cinnamon powder on the freshly cut wound at the base to help protect the orchid from rot

10
00:01:51,787 --> 00:01:56,777
Use 1 large garlic clove or 2 small garlic cloves

11
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,541
hash small

12
00:02:34,148 --> 00:02:39,136
put the garlic in the jar

13
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,867
Pour in 500ml of water at room temperature

14
00:02:53,797 --> 00:03:03,764
Wait 30 minutes for the nutrients from the garlic to dissolve into the water

15
00:03:13,045 --> 00:03:20,028
Use foam to arrange flowers

16
00:04:02,792 --> 00:04:08,785
After soaking for 30 minutes, filter out the residue

17
00:04:24,048 --> 00:04:35,046
Soak orchid branches in garlic water for 30 minutes

18
00:04:36,999 --> 00:04:39,617
30 minutes later

19
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:43,277
take out

20
00:04:44,489 --> 00:04:48,963
plug in the sucker

21
00:04:57,276 --> 00:05:02,009
Pour in filtered water just enough to moisten

22
00:05:12,243 --> 00:05:19,665
Close the lid and wait for the orchid branch to sprout

23
00:05:23,969 --> 00:05:27,220
After the next 3 weeks

24
00:05:42,388 --> 00:05:46,172
sprouts have woken up

25
00:06:05,555 --> 00:06:08,778
AFTER 1 NEXT MONTH

26
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,098
The orchid sprouts have grown and the roots have grown

27
00:06:50,371 --> 00:06:53,306
AFTER THE NEXT 2 MONTHS

28
00:07:06,047 --> 00:07:10,161
The small orchid has grown healthy.

29
00:07:19,795 --> 00:07:23,823
Now let's plant pots so that the orchid can adapt to the outside environment.

30
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:09,870
In my hand is a withered orchid branch.

31
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:18,002
And in this video I will share so you can propagate from any orchid branch.

32
00:08:18,502 --> 00:08:26,900
We cut off the spots that have bloomed.

33
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:38,198
Just keep these 3 segments and the orchid can sprout.

34
00:08:40,064 --> 00:08:50,895
Applying candle solution to the cut will help protect the orchid from rotting.

35
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:36,886
Peel off the protective film of the sleeping sprouts

36
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:09,880
Use 1 chopped fresh ginger branch

37
00:10:22,334 --> 00:10:29,883
Boil 500 ml of water and wait 1 day

38
00:10:36,445 --> 00:10:45,267
After 1 day, take it out and filter to remove residue.

39
00:10:48,683 --> 00:10:58,870
Soak orchids in ginger water for 30 minutes.

40
00:11:06,173 --> 00:11:15,200
Soak the moss in ginger water for 30 minutes.

41
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:43,028
I use recycled plastic boxes to make miniature greenhouses to help propagate orchids faster

42
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:51,893
There's a vent here

43
00:12:06,905 --> 00:12:16,888
Place the orchid in a miniature greenhouse and spray it with moisture once a week

44
00:12:16,888 --> 00:12:24,886
Place in a bright place, away from direct sunlight

45
00:12:24,886 --> 00:12:27,848
21 DAYS LATER.

46
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:07,603
Continue misting to keep it moist and keep it in a cool, well-lit place, away from direct sunlight.

47
00:13:10,191 --> 00:13:15,876
AFTER NEXT 1O DAYS

48
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:46,037
Continue misting to moisturize and leave in a well-lit place, avoiding direct sunlight

49
00:13:47,675 --> 00:13:52,669
AFTER NEXT 2 WEEKS

50
00:14:38,617 --> 00:14:48,591
Plant in a pot so the orchid can adapt and grow in the outside environment.

51
00:15:09,173 --> 00:15:19,885
If you find it interesting, please subscribe to the channel, like, and share so more people know.

52
00:15:45,335 --> 00:15:55,311
Remember to plant the base higher than the pot to prevent the orchid from rotting

53
00:16:07,204 --> 00:16:16,874
When the orchid has just lost all its flowers, it is the best time to propagate from the flower stem.

54
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:26,872
Buttons that have bloomed cannot be propagated.

55
00:16:28,768 --> 00:16:38,736
So I cut off the nodes that have finished blooming.

56
00:16:54,427 --> 00:17:04,398
Repair the cut to avoid crushing the flower stem.

57
00:17:36,434 --> 00:17:46,423
Sprinkle cinnamon powder on the cut to help it heal quickly and prevent rot.

58
00:17:52,663 --> 00:18:00,887
Leave for 1 day for the cut to dry completely.

59
00:18:07,705 --> 00:18:11,684
1 Day Later.

60
00:18:13,897 --> 00:18:22,882
Peel off the protective film on the flower button.

61
00:18:23,515 --> 00:18:31,514
This helps baby orchids easily germinate.

62
00:19:02,385 --> 00:19:12,372
Now I use tomatoes to revive young orchids from flower stems.

63
00:19:15,334 --> 00:19:25,303
Tomatoes contain many important nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K),

64
00:19:25,303 --> 00:19:32,568
are essential factors to promote the growth of orchids.

65
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:23,058
Then you tie the tomato core to this position to awaken the baby orchid sprouts to revive.

66
00:20:26,577 --> 00:20:36,889
This helps baby orchids quickly revive from flower stalks.

67
00:21:18,174 --> 00:21:28,879
Leave for about 30 minutes for the nutrients to penetrate into the flower stem.

68
00:21:39,657 --> 00:21:49,641
After 30 minutes, remove it.

69
00:22:28,739 --> 00:22:36,899
Then insert the flower stem into the sponge.

70
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:43,590
Place in a transparent jar.

71
00:22:45,177 --> 00:22:55,895
And pour a little water to always have the right humidity for the baby orchids to revive.

72
00:22:59,823 --> 00:23:08,792
Cover with transparent plastic and keep in a cool place.

73
00:23:21,972 --> 00:23:25,956
3 weeks later.

74
00:23:32,629 --> 00:23:40,619
The flower branches have begun to revive the baby orchids.

75
00:24:04,215 --> 00:24:14,879
Continue to put it in the vase and place it in a cool place for the baby orchids to grow.

76
00:24:29,089 --> 00:24:33,076
After the next 1 month.

77
00:24:43,856 --> 00:24:52,838
Baby orchids have formed from flower stems.

78
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:08,869
The baby orchids also take root at the same time.

79
00:25:12,815 --> 00:25:20,900
Both the small orchid and its roots are healthy.

80
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:38,796
Continue to put it in the vase and place it in a cool place for the baby orchids to grow.

81
00:25:52,603 --> 00:25:56,892
After the next 2 months.

82
00:26:06,872 --> 00:26:16,855
This simple method helps baby orchids grow very healthily.

83
00:26:24,596 --> 00:26:32,585
Now plant them in pots so they can grow outside.

84
00:26:38,334 --> 00:26:48,316
