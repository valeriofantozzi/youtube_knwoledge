00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:23,896
Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:24,896 --> 00:00:30,894
This is an orchid infected with a fungus that leads to rot.

3
00:00:50,244 --> 00:00:55,223
All roots are damaged

4
00:00:56,137 --> 00:01:02,122
The entire root should be cut off

5
00:01:28,016 --> 00:01:36,881
Only this leaf is still fresh so I will proceed to revive this orchid

6
00:01:38,975 --> 00:01:45,946
Rinse with water to remove pathogenic fungi.

7
00:01:52,950 --> 00:02:00,943
When eating garlic, don't throw away the peel because it has a very good antiseptic effect.

8
00:02:02,275 --> 00:02:08,271
In addition, garlic peels also contain many nutrients to help orchids grow quickly.

9
00:02:08,675 --> 00:02:15,874
Put the entire peel of 1 garlic bulb into the jar

10
00:02:20,448 --> 00:02:25,872
Add 1 liter of boiled water

11
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:36,869
This is rice, it contains many amino acids and minerals such as:

12
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:42,868
Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and vitamins are necessary for orchid growth.

13
00:02:44,525 --> 00:02:52,533
Add 3 tablespoons of rice and let it brew until the water cools so that the nutrients dissolve into the water.

14
00:03:04,244 --> 00:03:06,897
1 hour later

15
00:03:19,244 --> 00:03:25,227
Filter to remove residue

16
00:03:32,555 --> 00:03:40,523
Now wipe the top and bottom of the leaves with this water

17
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:52,421
Helps kill fungi and insects, protecting orchids from pests and diseases

18
00:04:00,068 --> 00:04:08,051
Then soak the orchid roots in this water for about 30 minutes to help stimulate root growth

19
00:04:13,884 --> 00:04:20,882
Now you can recycle used plastic containers to make orchid pots like me

20
00:04:37,557 --> 00:04:42,545
Use floral foam to grow orchids

21
00:05:16,705 --> 00:05:26,702
Plant the orchid and clamp it tightly so the plant is not damaged when it roots

22
00:05:32,267 --> 00:05:38,267
Add some water

23
00:05:42,874 --> 00:05:50,864
The water level does not reach the orchid roots

24
00:05:55,976 --> 00:06:01,962
and change the water when it seems dirty

25
00:06:04,122 --> 00:06:10,094
Spray moisturizer every 3 days

26
00:06:22,788 --> 00:06:29,757
Place the orchid in a cool place - Where there is light and a temperature of 25-30 degrees Celsius, the orchid will grow faster.

27
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:39,355
The remaining water is used to water weak orchids to help them take root quickly

28
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:48,786
Helps weak orchids recover quickly

29
00:06:51,682 --> 00:06:58,651
You can also water blooming orchids with this water

30
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:07,907
Helps flower buds not fall off and flowers stay on branches long before fading

31
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:16,414
Flowers can bloom for up to 6 months before fading.

32
00:07:19,743 --> 00:07:26,712
Doing this every 2 weeks for any orchid is good

33
00:07:31,562 --> 00:07:33,562
1 month later

34
00:07:44,621 --> 00:07:50,607
Many new roots grow

35
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:01,905
Orchids grow many young leaves and roots

36
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:11,870
The roots will help the orchid absorb nutrients and grow quickly

37
00:08:29,932 --> 00:08:39,075
With this simple method, you can easily restore orchids at home..

38
00:08:46,532 --> 00:08:55,527
I grow orchids in pots so they can grow naturally in the outside environment

39
00:09:15,257 --> 00:09:22,256
Hopefully the video will help you a lot in taking care of orchids at home
