132
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,639
for taking care of orchids after their

133
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,480
flowers have faded this method is

134
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:48,410
especially effective for helping wilted

135
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,279
or weak orchids recover and grow

[Music]

137
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:54,519
quickly this is an orchid that has

138
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,279
already bloomed but became wilted and

139
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:58,440
stunted so it was

140
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:00,760
discarded I picked it up with the hope

141
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:04,680
of Reviving it and helping it grow

142
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,680
strong again let's see how I do

143
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,480
it first trim off the old flower Spike

144
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:11,880
that has long

145
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,720
withered this helps the plant redirect

146
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:17,600
nutrients to root and leaf growth

147
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,600
instead of sustaining the dried flower

148
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:24,720
[Music]

149
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,800
stem next upon checking the roots I

150
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,399
found many in organic fertilizer pellets

151
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,399
in green and

152
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,380
[Music]

153
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,200
gray um this Orchid may have wilted

154
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,480
because the inorganic fertilizer damaged

155
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,240
its roots preventing it from absorbing

156
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,880
water and nutrients which cause the

157
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,639
leaves to wilt therefore we need to

158
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,519
remove these fertilizer pellets and

159
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,600
treat the roots to help the plant

160
00:11:54,519 --> 00:12:00,840
recover

[Music]

162
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:14,399
the roots are severely damaged and dry

163
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,519
uh this prevents the plant from

164
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,519
absorbing water and nutrients

165
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,760
uh the next step is to trim off the

166
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:46,120
damaged Roots so the plant can focus on

167
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,120
growing new healthier ones

168
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,279
next rinse the roots thoroughly with

169
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,399
water this removes any remaining dirt

170
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:19,560
old fertilizer and damaged Parts

171
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:19,560

world to make natural fertilizer I first

179
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,800
take one teaspoon of honey honey

180
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,399
provides natural nutrients and supports

181
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,880

183
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:21,680
way dilute the honey in 1 liter of

184
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,320
water this makes the solution lighter

185
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,279
allowing it to easily penetrate the

186
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:29,480

187
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,480

189
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,440

the plant recover quickly and grow

194
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:02,399
