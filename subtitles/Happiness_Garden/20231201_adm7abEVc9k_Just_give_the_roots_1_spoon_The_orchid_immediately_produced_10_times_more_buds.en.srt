00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:12,898
When orchids have enough nutrients and a good soil environment

3
00:00:14,898 --> 00:00:21,896
The plant will grow strongly and flower more.

4
00:00:22,896 --> 00:00:28,895
helps create the best conditions for flowers to grow,

5
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:36,893
At the same time, it helps orchids bloom more beautifully,

6
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:42,892
Both the roots and flowers are unimaginably large.

7
00:00:43,892 --> 00:00:53,890
The first method I will share with you is how to make fertilizer from activated carbon.

8
00:00:53,890 --> 00:01:01,633
It is made from naturally dried firewood.

9
00:01:02,888 --> 00:01:10,886
I use about 20 grams of activated carbon like this.

10
00:01:20,884 --> 00:01:30,882
Then puree with 2 liters of water.

11
00:01:36,881 --> 00:01:46,879
Filter to get clear water.

12
00:01:57,877 --> 00:02:08,875
Add water to make 5 liters of solution.

13
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:16,873
 
FIRST METHOD.

14
00:02:20,873 --> 00:02:28,871
I use this water to wash the leaves.

15
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:41,868
The orchid will be protected from fungi and insects.

16
00:02:47,031 --> 00:02:56,899
The calcium content in activated carbon helps make leaves strong.

17
00:02:57,899 --> 00:03:06,897
Do this regularly every 2 weeks and you will see healthy orchids

18
00:03:08,097 --> 00:03:12,896
SECOND METHOD.

19
00:03:19,894 --> 00:03:28,892
You can also use this water to spray the entire orchid plant.

20
00:03:32,892 --> 00:03:40,890
Helps kill fungi and insects on leaves very well.

21
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:55,887
and it also provides some nutrients through the leaves.

22
00:04:02,886 --> 00:04:05,885
THIRD METHOD.

23
00:04:07,885 --> 00:04:16,883
Now use this water to water the orchid roots.

24
00:04:21,882 --> 00:04:30,880
Do this periodically every 2 weeks for normal orchids.

25
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:45,877
Helps prevent diseases and improve pH in growing media.

26
00:04:48,877 --> 00:04:58,875
Activated carbon also contains high levels of calcium and natural minerals that are very good for orchids.

27
00:05:02,023 --> 00:05:08,873
Helps stimulate rooting.

28
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:22,870
Soaking in this water for about 30 minutes is better.

29
00:05:33,868 --> 00:05:36,867
RESULT.

30
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:46,898
The roots are very strong.

31
00:05:52,897 --> 00:06:02,895
If the planting medium has good drainage, the orchid will never have root rot.

32
00:06:11,894 --> 00:06:21,892
After about 1-2 months, depending on the orchid variety, many branch roots will grow.

33
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:36,889
Helps orchids absorb nutrients best.

34
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:06,883
The flowers will be brighter and stronger.

35
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:30,878
Many flower buds grow on the same tree.

36
00:07:36,877 --> 00:07:45,875
The leaves are very strong and sturdy.

37
00:07:47,874 --> 00:07:57,873
Surely you will be surprised with this type of fertilizer.

38
00:08:03,871 --> 00:08:12,870
Now I continue to share how to make the second type of fertilizer.

39
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:24,867
To help you have many choices when caring for orchids at home with organic fertilizer.

40
00:08:24,867 --> 00:08:30,899
Subscribe to the video so you don't miss any tips on my channel.

41
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:40,897
To make this fertilizer you need ash.

42
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:52,895
Take 1 teaspoon of ash and soak it in 1 liter of warm water for 2 hours.

43
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:26,888
Next, take 2 liters of water and put it in the jar.

44
00:09:36,886 --> 00:09:46,884
and take 15ml of milk.

45
00:09:47,884 --> 00:09:56,882
Then mix the milk into the water.

46
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:15,879
FIRST METHOD.

47
00:10:16,878 --> 00:10:24,877
Clean the leaf surface with this water

48
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:34,875
The leaf surface will always be clean and the stomata will be clear.

49
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:40,874
Orchids will photosynthesize better.

50
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:44,873
SECOND METHOD.

51
00:10:50,872 --> 00:11:00,870
Filter to get clear water.

52
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:26,898
Mix the two together.

53
00:11:42,895 --> 00:11:52,893
Now you take this liquid fertilizer mixture and apply it to the orchid roots..

54
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:09,889
Milk-based fertilizer provides natural calcium which is very good for orchids.

55
00:12:15,888 --> 00:12:23,886
Ash contains nitrogen in compound form.

56
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:41,883
In addition, ash also contains many other chemical elements that are very good for orchids such as:

57
00:12:46,882 --> 00:12:55,880
potassium, magnesium, iron, calcium, phosphorus, boron, sulfur...

58
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:06,878
Using ash can replace phosphate and potassium fertilizers.

59
00:13:11,877 --> 00:13:21,875
Do this 1-2 times/month to supplement nutrition and increase the orchid's resistance.

60
00:13:25,874 --> 00:13:29,873
THIRD METHOD

61
00:13:39,871 --> 00:13:48,870
Spray this fertilizer on the entire orchid.

62
00:13:51,869 --> 00:13:59,867
This method is similar to using foliar fertilizer.

63
00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:10,899
The potassium in ash is very rich, which will help orchids resist drought and develop flowers very well.

64
00:14:11,898 --> 00:14:18,897
Do this 1-2 times/month to supplement nutrition and increase the orchid's resistance.

65
00:14:19,897 --> 00:14:22,896
RESULT.

66
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:31,894
After 1 month of fertilization, the orchid has developed many branch roots.

67
00:14:35,894 --> 00:14:43,892
This helps the orchid absorb the most nutrients to feed the plant.

68
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:09,887
This type of fertilizer also stimulates the growth and development of sprouts very well.

69
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:36,882
The nutrition of this synthetic fertilizer helps leaves stay green.

70
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:51,879
Potassium in ash helps orchids develop many flower buds.

71
00:15:56,878 --> 00:16:05,876
The flowers bloom more brightly than usual.

72
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:16,874
The flowers stay on the branches for a long time, it can take up to 6 months to fade.

73
00:16:19,873 --> 00:16:26,872
