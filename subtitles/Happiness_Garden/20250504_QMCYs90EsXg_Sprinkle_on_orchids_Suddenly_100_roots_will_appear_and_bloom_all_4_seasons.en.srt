00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,199
Uh, you see here a withered

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,000
orchid. Perhaps it's because they

12
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:44,320
haven't been watered regularly or

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,320
because direct sunlight has shown on the

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,960
orchid. If if you want the orchid to be

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,520
nourished and grow quickly, please watch

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,520

when replanting in a new environment.

35
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,720
When the roots are washed, the plant

36
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,360
