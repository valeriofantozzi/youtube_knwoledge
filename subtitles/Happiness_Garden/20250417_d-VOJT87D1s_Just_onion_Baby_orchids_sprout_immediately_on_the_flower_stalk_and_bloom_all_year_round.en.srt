00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,920
Hello everyone. Thank you for visiting

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,920
my

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,080
garden. Today I'm very excited to

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,000
continue sharing with you how to

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,320
propagate orchids through cutings at

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,599
home using very simple ingredients that

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,599
you can easily find in your

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,560
kitchen. If you find this helpful, don't

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,000
forget to subscribe to the channel to

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,519
support me and to make sure you don't

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,519
miss any tips on plant care.

12
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,800
As you can see, this orchid has finished

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,239
blooming, and this is the perfect time

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,130
for us to start the process of

15
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:37,719
propagating orchids from

16
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,719
[Music]

17
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,879
cutings. I will cut across this old

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,230
flower stem to begin the process of

19
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:48,480
propagating the orchid through cutings.

20
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:50,640
[Music]

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,160
We need to cut neatly to avoid crushing

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,000
the cut, creating the best conditions

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,670
for the orchid cutting to grow into a

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,170
strong, healthy, young

26
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:06,880
plant. Next, we remove the protective

27
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,439
layer around the dormant bud to help

28
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,960
stimulate it to sprout faster, which

29
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,520
will encourage the young plant to grow

30
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,520
strong and quickly.

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,799
Next, I take an onion as onions contain

32
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,780
a lot of nutrients and natural compounds

33
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,849
that are great for orchid

00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,240

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,240
onions, especially antioxidants and

37
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,759
ends, help stimulate root formation and

38
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,620
enhance the growth potential of the

39
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:42,880
young plant.

00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:44,960
[Music]

41
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,280
Onions also help prevent mold and

42
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,640
harmful bacteria, keeping the cutting

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,640
healthy throughout the development

44
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:00,390
process. I put the onion in here to

45
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:06,560
extract the onion juice.

46
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:08,720
[Music]

47
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,640
Please comment and let me know which

48
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,480
country you're watching the video from.

49
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,599
It's so amazing that we can chat

50
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,599
together from all around the

51
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:29,120
world. Do as I did. Then wait for about

52
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,830
10 minutes to allow the onion juice to

53
00:02:29,120 --> 00:03:03,920
soak into the cutting.

00:02:30,830 --> 00:03:05,920
[Music]

55
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,319
Uh after soaking the cutting in onion

56
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,720
juice for about 10 minutes, take it out

57
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:14,000
and let the cut dry naturally for a few

58
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,760
hours. This helps the cut to heal,

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,519
reducing the risk of infection and

60
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,239
creating optimal conditions for root

61
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,239
development later on.

62
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,120
Then apply a special plant glue to the

63
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:31,280
cut, which helps prevent water from

64
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,519
seeping into the wound. This will

65
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,840
protect the cut from bacteria and mold,

66
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,720
thus preventing rot and allowing the new

67
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,159
plant to grow

68
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,480
healthily. Then place the cutting in a

69
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,040
cool, wellventilated area to allow the

70
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,799
glue to dry completely.

71
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,959
This will help the glue dry evenly and

72
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,720
form a solid protective layer,

73
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,840
preventing bacterial infection and

74
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,840
supporting better growth of the

75
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,599
plant. While waiting for the glue to dry

76
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,400
completely, take one teaspoon of

77
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,640
cinnamon powder and soak it in one liter

78
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,439
of hot water to treat the growing medium

79
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,439
before inserting the cutting.

80
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,040
Cinnamon powder has antibacterial and

81
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,199
antifungal properties, helping to clean

82
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,840
the growing medium, prevent the growth

83
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,800

84
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,579

87
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,800
out the residue to leave only the clear

89
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,360
growing medium.

90
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,240
This ensures that the growing medium

91
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,199
will not be contaminated with

92
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:45,040

cinnamon water for about 20 minutes.

97
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,960
This will help the moss of absorb

98
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,840
nutrients from the cinnamon water while

99
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,280
also disinfecting it and creating a good

100
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,170

101
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:38,560

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,360
Then remove the moss and let it drain.

104
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,280
The moss has now been treated and is

105
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,080
ready to be used as a growing medium for

106
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,080
rooting orchid cutings.

107
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,400
I have recycled a plastic bottle to

108
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,479
create a mini greenhouse which helps

111
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,520
orchid cutings. Here I have created

112
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,240
ventilation holes in the plastic bottle

113
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,800

excessive moisture

115
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,960

116
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,199
at the bottom of the plastic bottle to

117
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,520
prevent water from accumulating which

118
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,520
could cause root rot in the cutings.

120
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,520
After placing the moss inside, we will

121
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,400
insert the cutting and mist it regularly

122
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,319

123
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,080
the humidity stable for the cutting,

124
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,240
creating a favorable environment for

125
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,199

eggshells to make natural fertilizer.

231

into small

233
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,360

234
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,399
for lush leaves while eggshells add

235
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,399
calcium to strengthen roots.

236
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,040
The mild acidity of coffee grounds pairs

237
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,959
with the alkalinity of eggshells to

238
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,959
create a balanced pH suitable for

239
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,959

This fertilizer solution helps prevent

282
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,199
certain pests or fungi due to the mild
