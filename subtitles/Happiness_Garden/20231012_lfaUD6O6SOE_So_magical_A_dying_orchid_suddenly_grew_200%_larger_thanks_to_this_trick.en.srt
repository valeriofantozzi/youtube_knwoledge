Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:12,898
This is a wilted orchid.

3
00:00:12,898 --> 00:00:20,896
If you also love orchids, please join me in reviving it.

4
00:00:22,896 --> 00:00:29,895
First, subscribe to the channel so you don't miss any videos.

5
00:00:33,894 --> 00:00:41,892
First take an aloe vera leaf.

6
00:00:42,892 --> 00:00:52,209
Aloe vera gel is very good in restoring wilted and stunted orchids.

7
00:00:57,889 --> 00:01:07,887
Apply this aloe vera gel on the top and bottom of the leaves every 5 days.

8
00:01:12,886 --> 00:01:22,884
Aloe vera gel contains many vitamins, minerals, and amino acids

9
00:01:22,884 --> 00:01:30,882
and enzymes stimulate the growth, development and flowering of orchids.

10
00:01:36,881 --> 00:01:46,879
Next I use rice, because it contains a lot of B vitamins, especially vitamin B1 and minerals that are very good for orchid growth.

11
00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:11,874
Roast 100 grams of rice until crispy.

12
00:02:16,873 --> 00:02:23,872
Wait for the rice to cool completely.

13
00:02:36,869 --> 00:03:22,894
Once cooled, grind into powder.

14
00:03:32,892 --> 00:03:46,889
Take 1 spoon of roasted rice flour mixed with 2 liters of water.

15
00:04:02,886 --> 00:04:12,884
Then water the orchid roots with this rice water every 5 days.

16
00:04:16,883 --> 00:04:26,881
Rice water prevents shock, helps orchids adapt to new environments faster,

17
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:39,878
Especially when newly planted trees, or orchids are stunted or withered in the environment.

18
00:04:52,876 --> 00:05:03,874
Soaking the orchid pot in rice flour water for about 30 minutes will stimulate the roots to develop better.

19
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:16,871
Spray mist every day to moisturize with water.

20
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,869
 
2 WEEKS LATER.

21
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:38,900
The leaves become stiffer and the roots grow more branches.

22
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:56,898
A developed root system will help the orchid absorb nutrients and water, helping the plant recover quickly

23
00:06:08,894 --> 00:06:18,892
Continue watering rice flour every 5 days.

24
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:42,887
and continue to apply aloe vera gel to the top and bottom of the leaves every 5 days.

25
00:07:00,911 --> 00:07:05,883
After the next 3 months.

26
00:07:08,882 --> 00:07:18,880
The leaves are very strong and healthy.

27
00:07:36,877 --> 00:07:46,875
I continue to water with rice flour water.

28
00:08:06,871 --> 00:08:16,869
and continue to apply aloe vera gel to this orchid every 5 days.

29
00:08:44,897 --> 00:08:48,896
After the next 3 months.

30
00:08:55,894 --> 00:09:05,892
The orchid has completely recovered.

31
00:09:12,891 --> 00:09:22,889
The leaves are sturdy and have 2 more flower stems.

32
00:09:28,888 --> 00:09:38,886
