Welcome to the happiness garden. In

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,560
today's video, I will share with you a

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,679
natural fertilizer that is easy to make

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,679
but brings amazing results. This is the

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,400
secret to helping orchids grow stronger

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,640
everyday with healthy roots, green

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,119
leaves, and especially vibrant blooms

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,119
all year round. Each drop of this

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,279
fertilizer not only nourishes the plant,

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,080
but also carries the love and patience

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,840
of the grower. So, let's begin the

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,400
journey of caring for orchids in a

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,900
natural, gentle, yet truly inspiring

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,040
way.

[Music]

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,360
The first ingredient to make this

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,520
fertilizer is eggshells. You only need

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,480
about four to five eggshells washed

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,640
clean to remove any remaining egg white.

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,879
Though small, eggshells contain a lot of

21
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,360
calcium, an essential nutrient that

22
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,239
helps orchid roots grow strong and

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,559
resist pests and diseases. By making use

24
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,399
of simple ingredients like these, we not

25
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,559
only take good care of our plants, but

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,559
also help protect the environment around

27
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,559
us.

[Music]

29
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:19,799
After washing, dry the eggshells under

30
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,799
sunlight until they are completely dry.

31
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,540
[Music]

32
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,439
Sunlight not only makes the shells more

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,840
brittle and easier to crush, but also

34
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:37,079
kills bacteria and mold that could harm

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,079
the plants.

[Music]

37
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,280
After the eggshells are completely dry,

38
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,600
crush them into small pieces. You can

39
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,520
use a mortar and pestle or a blender as

40
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,640
long as the shells are ground into fine

41
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,640
powder or small fragments.

growing tips. It's wonderful to have you

along for the journey.

55
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,800
Method one is very simple. You just need

56
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,720
to sprinkle about one spoonful of the

57
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,319
crushed eggshell powder over the surface

58
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,400
of the orchid pot.

59
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,560
This thin layer of powder will slowly

60
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,640
dissolve each time you water the plant,

61
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,040
providing calcium in a natural and safe

62
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,120
way. It's a slow release but effective

63
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,360
method that helps orchid roots absorb

64
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,120
nutrients steadily and encourages

65
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,599
healthy growth, resulting in

66
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,070
longerlasting and more beautiful blooms

67
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:27,169
over time.

68
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,169
[Music]

69
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,239
Another wonderful benefit of sprinkling

70
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,000
eggshell powder is that it helps

71
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,239
neutralize the acidity in the growing

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,560
medium. When the orchid's environment

73
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,120
becomes too acidic, the roots have

74
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,440
difficulty absorbing nutrients. The

75
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,680
eggshell powder gently balances the pH

76
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,599
level, creating ideal conditions for the

77
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,640
roots to grow strong and absorb

78
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,640
nutrients more effectively.

79
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,360
In addition, eggshell powder helps

80
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,360
prevent snails and other small insects

81
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,239
as the sharp fragments of the shells

82
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,840
keep them from crawling near. This is a

83
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,319
natural and safe way to protect your

84
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,879
orchids from being eaten without using

85
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,480
chemical pesticides. As a result, you

86
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,560
not only keep your plants healthy, but

87
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,359
also maintain a green, clean, and

88
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,359
eco-friendly garden.

[Music]

90
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,840
Method two, put the crushed eggshells

91
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,759
into a clean jar to make a liquid

92
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,440
fertilizer. This method allows the

93
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,600
minerals in the eggshells, especially

94
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,940
calcium, to dissolve more easily and be

95
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:45,740
absorbed by the plant more quickly.

[Music]

99
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,199
Next, pour about 100 ml of Coca-Cola

100
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,199
into the jar. It may sound unusual, but

101
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,759
Coca-Cola contains sugar and a small

102
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,320
amount of acid that helps break down the

103
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,479
minerals in the eggshells more quickly.

104
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,639
When combined, this mixture creates a

105
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,800
nutrient-rich natural fertilizer that

106
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,000
orchids can easily absorb, helping them

107
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,240
grow stronger and healthier. This is a

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,039
simple yet surprisingly effective secret

109
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,039
for your orchid pots.

110
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,479
You can see that right after pouring in

111
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,680
the Coca-Cola, a reaction begins to

112
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,199
occur. Tiny bubbles start to appear.

113
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,440
This is a sign that the acid in the

114
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,600
Coca-Cola is dissolving the calcium from

115
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,600
the eggshells.

116
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:00,149
[Music]

117
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,600
The next ingredient is rice. It's a

118
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,919
familiar ingredient, but but provides

119
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,759
excellent nutrients for orchids,

120
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,759
especially vitamin B and natural

121
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,759
minerals.

122
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,840
Now add about 2 tablespoons of rice.

123
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,240
This amount is just enough to provide

124
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,479
the necessary nutrients without making

125
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,960
the mixture too thick or causing it to

126
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,319
ferment too quickly.

127
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,639
When the rice is soaked together with

128
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,319
the eggshell and Coca-Cola mixture, the

129
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,160
vitamins and minerals in the rice are

130
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,160
released, turning the solution into a

131
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,160
natural energy richch fertilizer for

132
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,160
orchids.

133
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,319
After stirring the mixture well, cover

134
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,160
it and let it sit for about 2 days.

135
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,400
During this time, the ingredients will

136
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,639
gradually blend together, creating a

137
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,350
lightly fermented, nutrient-rich

138
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:12,740
solution.

139
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:12,740
[Music]

140
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,280
After fermenting for 2 days, strain the

141
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,680
mixture to separate the liquid and

142
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,240
discard the residue. Uh the liquid

143
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,319
obtained at this stage is rich in easily

144
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,919
absorbed minerals and vitamins which are

145
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,080
excellent for the growth of orchid roots

146
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,080
and leaves.

147
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:55,750
[Music]

148
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,720
Dilute the solution with about 2 L of

149
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,319
clean water. This step is very important

150
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,639
because if the mixture is too

151
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,120
concentrated, the orchid roots may get

152
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,199
shocked or slightly burned. When

153
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,360
properly diluted, the fertilizer becomes

154
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:17,759
gentler, allowing the plant to easily

155
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,680
absorb the nutrients and grow healthily.

156
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,240
Then use a soft cloth soaked in this

157
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:26,520
mixture and gently wipe both the upper

158
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,520
and lower surfaces of the leaves.

159
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,680
When you wipe the leaves with this

160
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,240
liquid fertilizer mixture, the dust and

161
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,279
mold on the leaf surface are completely

162
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,680
removed. Clean leaves help the stomata

163
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,080
function more efficiently, enhancing gas

164
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,159
exchange and photosynthesis. As a

165
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,160
result, the plant absorbs light better,

166
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,390
grows stronger, and stays naturally

167
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,480
green and vibrant.

The mixture made from rice, eggshells,

170
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,959
and Coca-Cola is rich in vitamins,

171
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,640
minerals, and calcium. When applied to

172
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,279
the leaves, the plant absorbs part of

173
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,959
these nutrients directly.

174
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,640
This is a quick and effective way to

175
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,959
provide extra nourishment, helping

176
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,200
orchid leaves stay glossy, thick,

177
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,430
healthy, and preventing yellowing caused

178
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,970
by nutrient deficiencies.

[Music]

180
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,760
Thanks to the minerals and mild acids in

181
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,080
Coca-Cola, this solution can inhibit the

182
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,399
growth of harmful bacteria and fungi on

183
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,720
the leaf surface.

184
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,880
When used regularly, orchids develop

185
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,360
stronger resistance, reducing the risk

186
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,200
of leaf rot or brown spots and keeping

187
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,200
the plant healthy and vibrant all year

188
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,200
round.

189
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,720

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,080
When nourished with this natural

193
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,959
fertilizer mixture, the orchid leaves

194
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,200
absorb nutrients effectively, supporting

195
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,880
the process of bud formation and flower

196
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,480
development. The blooms will have

197
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,670
brighter colors and last longer,

198
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:05,290
bringing vibrant beauty to your garden.

201
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,880
You can also pour this mixture directly

202
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,720
onto the roots and growing medium. This

203
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,200
method allows the nutrients to penetrate

204
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,000
deeply, nourishing the root system and

205
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,320
stimulating new root growth. When the

206
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,959
roots are strong, the plant absorbs

207
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,040
water and nutrients more efficiently,

208
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:38,000
resulting in greener leaves and more

209
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,760
vibrant blooms. It's a simple yet

210
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,060
sustainable method that nourishes your

211
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:46,880
orchid from root to tip.

[Music]

213
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,040
Calcium from the eggshells strengthens

214
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,920
the roots while the nutrients from the

215
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,600
rice support cell regeneration.

216
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,000
As a result, orchid roots grow

217
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,839
vigorously, absorb water and minerals

218
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,560
more efficiently, and keep the plant

219
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,560
lush and full of vitality.

220
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,720
Uh this solution not only nourishes the

221
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,720
roots but also helps balance the pH in

222
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,200
the growing medium reducing mold and

223
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,800
harmful bacteria. When the root

224
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,560
environment is improved, the orchid

225
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,839
grows more steadily and and can more

226
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,839
easily form new flower buds.

227
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,640
After watering, you can also soak the

228
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,440
orchid pot in this fertilizer mixture

229
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,440
for about 20 minutes. During the soaking

230
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,440
process, the minerals will deeply

231
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,000
penetrate each small root, helping the

232
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,000
plant grow faster.

233
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,480
Alternatively, you can put the mixture

234
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:52,270
into a spray bottle and mist it onto the

235
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:55,419
leaves and roots of the orchid.

This method helps the fertilizer

239
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,519
solution distribute evenly, quickly,

240
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,680
reaching the gaps between leaves, stems,

241
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,399
and small roots that regular watering

242
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,399
can't reach. Gentle spraying provides

243
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,560
nutrients uniformly to the plant while

244
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,399
also keeping the leaves clean and bright

245
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,880

246
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,040
effectively.

247
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,040
It's a convenient technique, especially

248
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,880
suitable for hanging orchid pots or

249
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:41,320
those with many stems, offering

250
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,320
comprehensive care in a gentle way.

and harmful bacteria in the growing

262
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,800
medium. As a result, the orchid grows

263
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,200
strong from the roots with sturdy roots,

264
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,920

If there is still water on the leaves

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,320
after soaking, use a soft cloth to blot

272
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,079
it all dry. This helps prevent the

273
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,560
leaves from becoming water logged or

274
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:55,040
moldy while keeping the leaf surface dry

275
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,279
and clean. When the leaves are dry and

276
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,920
airy, the plant absorbs nutrients more

277
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,000
effectively. The roots stay healthy and

278
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,930

Note that although this fertilizer is

346
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,679
very beneficial, you should only use it

347
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,679
once a month. Regular monthly watering

348
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,840
helps improve the growing medium and

349
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,559
provide necessary nutrients to the plant

350
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,559
without causing harm. If too much

351
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,559
Coca-Cola is used, the acid in the

352
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,559
solution can accumulate and be harmful

353
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,679
to the roots, making them weak or

354
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:09,600
damaged. Therefore, consider the timing

355
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,160
and dosage carefully to ensure your

356
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,720
