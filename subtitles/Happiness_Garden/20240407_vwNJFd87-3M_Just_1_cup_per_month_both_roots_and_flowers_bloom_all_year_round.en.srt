Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:16,897
In this video, I share the method of recovering weak orchids.

3
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:28,895
Helps them quickly take root and grow strongly.

4
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:42,892
I picked up a rotten orchid that someone had thrown away.

5
00:01:06,887 --> 00:01:16,885
All the roots have rotted.

6
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:56,877
This original part has completely rotted so it can no longer be used.

7
00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:11,874
Wash orchid branches with water.

8
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:28,871
Then take 1 clove of garlic and mince it.

9
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:24,893
Add 500ml of water and soak for 30 minutes.

10
00:03:24,893 --> 00:03:31,892
Let the flower nutrition completely dissolve in water.

11
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,890
AFTER 30 MINUTES.

12
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:58,887
Wiping orchid branches with garlic water helps disinfect and eliminate fungal diseases.

13
00:04:22,882 --> 00:04:32,880
Then soak the orchid branches in garlic water for 10 minutes.

14
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:43,903
This helps stimulate root and shoot growth.

15
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,875
10 Minutes Later.

16
00:05:12,872 --> 00:05:22,870
because this orchid has many scars from previous insect bites.

17
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:31,868
So I waited a day for the orchid to dry completely before planting it.

18
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,899
1 Day Later.

19
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:53,897
I recycle sponges as orchid nursery tools.

20
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:36,889
Soaking the sponge in garlic water for 20 minutes helps disinfect and kill fungus.

21
00:06:46,887 --> 00:06:50,886
20 MINUTES LATER.

22
00:07:06,883 --> 00:07:16,881
Insert the orchid stem into the sponge and place it in the vase.

23
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:30,878
Pour some water into the jar and change it every time it gets dirty.

24
00:07:32,878 --> 00:07:40,876
Spray moisturizer every 3 days.

25
00:07:40,876 --> 00:07:50,874
and Place in a cool, well-lit place.

26
00:07:55,873 --> 00:07:59,872
5 WEEKS LATER

27
00:08:03,872 --> 00:08:10,870
The roots have grown very healthy.

28
00:08:17,869 --> 00:08:27,900
With this simple method, the roots have grown and the orchid has revived very well.

29
00:08:59,894 --> 00:09:09,892
I planted it in a pot so the orchid could grow better.

30
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:26,889

In this video, I share how to take care of orchids to help them grow and flower

35
00:10:10,013 --> 00:10:13,879
You see my orchids.

36
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:24,877
New flowers always grow after the old ones fall

37
00:10:25,877 --> 00:10:33,875
so my orchids bloom all year round.

38
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:39,874
bloom from branch to branch.

39
00:10:41,873 --> 00:10:46,873
flowers bloom on long branches

40
00:10:52,871 --> 00:10:59,870
Flowers can be kept on branches for up to 6 months

41
00:11:05,869 --> 00:11:10,868
Many flowers grow on the same tree

42
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:28,898
New roots grow a lot to help absorb nutrients best

43
00:11:32,897 --> 00:11:37,896
chubby flower buds

44
00:11:47,894 --> 00:11:52,893
Help flowers bloom long on branches

45
00:12:01,891 --> 00:12:06,890
brilliant flowers

46
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:12,889
How to make fertilizer as follows:

47
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:16,888
Use 1 small carrot weighing about 30g

48
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,420
Cut into small pieces

49
00:12:41,883 --> 00:12:45,882
Add 1 liter of filtered water

50
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,880
Puree

51
00:13:08,878 --> 00:13:12,877
filter out residue

52
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:45,870
Add 1 liter of filtered water

53
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,870
How to use

54
00:13:50,869 --> 00:13:55,868
Use a cotton ball to soak up carrot juice

55
00:13:57,868 --> 00:14:02,867
Wipe both the top and bottom of the leaves

56
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:13,898
help get rid of insects

57
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:17,897
and open stomata

58
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:29,895
Orchid will have better photosynthesis and metabolism

59
00:14:33,894 --> 00:14:40,893
At the same time, orchids also absorb some nutrients through the leaves

60
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:07,888
Help keep the leaves green

61
00:15:41,881 --> 00:15:45,880
2nd way

62
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:52,879
Water this carrot for orchids

63
00:15:53,878 --> 00:15:58,877
Carrot juice is a good source of nutrients for orchids,

64
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:06,876
including vitamins and minerals like beta-carotene, potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus.

65
00:16:07,876 --> 00:16:11,875
When the carrot juice is poured into the orchid pot,

66
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:15,874
it provides nutrients to the orchids and helps to promote their health.

67
00:16:17,874 --> 00:16:23,872
In addition, carrot juice is also acidic, which helps regulate the pH of the potted soil

68
00:16:23,872 --> 00:16:28,871
and enhances the orchid's ability to absorb nutrients.

69
00:16:30,871 --> 00:16:38,870
You can soak the orchid pot in this carrot juice for 20 minute

70
00:16:39,869 --> 00:16:44,868
Do this 1-2 times a month

71
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:54,900
3rd way

72
00:17:06,897 --> 00:17:11,896
mist moisturizing carrot juice for orchids

73
00:17:16,895 --> 00:17:21,894
Spray both the top and bottom of the leaves

74
00:17:22,894 --> 00:17:27,893
help wash away dirt, wash away insects on orchids

75
00:17:27,893 --> 00:17:33,892
Nutrients in carrot juice help orchids thrive and bloom

76
00:17:33,892 --> 00:17:38,891
However, be careful not to over-water the carrot juice as it can clog the water lines in the orchid.

77
00:17:39,891 --> 00:17:44,890
Do not water the flowers because the flowers fall off quickly

78
00:17:47,889 --> 00:17:52,888

Subscribe to the video so you don't miss any tips on my channel.

84
00:18:38,879 --> 00:18:42,878
No.1

85
00:18:42,878 --> 00:18:50,877
To make this fertilizer you need apples.

86
00:18:56,876 --> 00:19:06,874
Apples contain potassium, an important mineral for orchid growth.

87
00:19:12,872 --> 00:19:22,870
Potassium helps orchids develop stronger leaves, roots and flowers.

88
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:36,868
I took the apple peel and put it in a bottle.

89
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:50,898
Soak in boiled water and leave overnight.

90
00:20:06,895 --> 00:20:08,895
No. 2

91
00:20:10,894 --> 00:20:20,892
To make this type of fertilizer you need more eggshells.

92
00:20:41,888 --> 00:20:51,886
Soak the eggshells in boiled water and leave overnight.

93
00:21:07,883 --> 00:21:12,882
Leave overnight

94
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:38,877
After 1 night, filter the water.

95
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:29,900
So we have fertilizer from apples and eggshells.

96
00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:35,899
FIRST METHOD.

97
00:22:39,898 --> 00:22:48,896
Water this fertilizer solution on the orchid roots.

98
00:22:55,895 --> 00:23:05,893
Eggshells provide natural calcium which is very good for orchids.

99
00:23:05,893 --> 00:23:16,891
Helps orchids stay healthy and increase resistance.

100
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:36,887
Apple peels contain a lot of Phosphorus, which is also an important nutrient for orchid growth.

101
00:23:41,886 --> 00:23:53,883
especially during the flowering and flower development stage.

102
00:24:00,882 --> 00:24:10,880
Do this 1-2 times/month to supplement nutrition and increase the orchid's resistance.

103
00:24:25,877 --> 00:24:29,876
SECOND METHOD.

104
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:46,873
Spray this fertilizer on the entire orchid.

105
00:24:52,872 --> 00:24:59,870
This method is similar to using foliar fertilizer.

106
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:16,867
Calcium in eggshells helps orchids stay healthy and increases their resistance to pests.

107
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:32,897
Apples contain nitrogen, an important nutrient.

108
00:25:33,897 --> 00:25:42,895
Helps orchids develop green parts and increase photosynthesis ability.

109
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:06,890
Do not spray on flowers.

110
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:15,889
Because wet flowers will easily fall off.

111
00:26:16,888 --> 00:26:20,888
THIRD METHOD

112
00:26:25,887 --> 00:26:35,885
Clean the leaf surface with this liquid fertilizer.

113
00:26:40,884 --> 00:26:48,882
The leaf surface will always be clean and airy.

114
00:26:55,881 --> 00:27:03,879
Orchids will photosynthesize better.

115
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:18,876
Fertilizing regularly 1-2 times/month will help keep the leaves healthy.

116
00:27:20,876 --> 00:27:24,875
No. 3

117
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:36,873
You can reuse eggshells and apple peels to make fertilizer again.

118
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,899
RESULT.

119
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:22,897
This type of fertilizer stimulates rooting very quickly.

120
00:28:29,895 --> 00:28:39,894
After 1 month of use you will see great results.

121
00:28:44,893 --> 00:28:56,890
Many flower buds develop and do not fall.

122
00:29:10,887 --> 00:29:20,885
Blooming flowers stay on the branches for a long time before fading.

123
00:29:26,884 --> 00:29:36,882
Flowers can remain on branches for up to 6 months before falling.

124
00:29:51,879 --> 00:30:03,877
4/4

125
00:30:06,276 --> 00:30:15,274
if you have orchids after blooming.

126
00:30:16,186 --> 00:30:26,172
If all the flowers have fallen, don't rush to throw them away.

127
00:30:26,172 --> 00:30:36,670
Let me tell you how to help these branches continue to bloom strongly again.

128
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:46,868
These nodes can continue to bloom very well.

129
00:31:11,938 --> 00:31:19,928
When you eat bananas.

130
00:31:20,928 --> 00:31:28,926
Don't throw away the peel.

131
00:31:34,925 --> 00:31:44,923
Thinly sliced ​​banana peels contain many vitamins and minerals that are very good for the bud formation process.

132
00:32:08,918 --> 00:32:18,916
Soak banana peels in 1 liter of boiled water.

133
00:32:27,915 --> 00:32:35,913
Then take 3 tablespoons of coffee grounds.

134
00:32:48,911 --> 00:32:58,909
Then soak this coffee grounds in 1 liter of boiled water.

135
00:33:04,907 --> 00:33:12,906
Then wait for the water to cool.

136
00:33:20,871 --> 00:33:30,869
After the water cools, filter to remove sediment.

137
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:50,898
Dip a cotton ball in water extracted from coffee grounds and wash the leaves.

138
00:33:54,897 --> 00:34:04,895
Helps eliminate pests and diseases of orchids.

139
00:34:11,894 --> 00:34:20,892
and leaves will photosynthesize better.

140
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:46,887
Mix these two types together.

141
00:34:54,886 --> 00:35:04,884
Dip cotton balls in this water and clip them to nodes that are likely to continue blooming.

142
00:35:10,882 --> 00:35:20,880
Do it once a week.

143
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:40,876
will help stimulate rapid sprout growth.

144
00:36:00,873 --> 00:36:10,871
Keep the cotton pad on the branch like that for 20 minutes and then remove it.

145
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:24,868
then water the roots once a week.

146
00:36:34,899 --> 00:36:44,897
Soak it for 10 minutes then lift it out.

147
00:36:59,894 --> 00:37:09,892
And spray this water once a week to help supplement nutrients through the leaves.

148
00:37:26,889 --> 00:37:34,887
After 20 minutes, remove the cotton pad.

149
00:37:56,883 --> 00:38:06,881
Then place the plant in a place with lots of light so it can bloom easily.

150
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,879
1 MONTH LATER.

151
00:38:19,878 --> 00:38:29,876
Many buds have grown.

152
00:39:14,867 --> 00:39:24,899
Continue watering and spraying the orchid with this water once a week.

153
00:39:45,895 --> 00:39:53,893
Then place the plant in a place with lots of light so it can bloom easily.

154
00:39:56,892 --> 00:40:00,892
After the next 1 month.

155
00:40:05,891 --> 00:40:15,889
From the dry branches, many beautiful flowers have sprouted and bloomed.

156
00:40:19,888 --> 00:40:29,886
The leaves are strong and sturdy, very resistant to pests and diseases.

157
00:40:40,884 --> 00:40:50,882
The flower color is also more vibrant than usual.

158
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:06,879
