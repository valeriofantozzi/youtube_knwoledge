00:00:28,084 --> 00:00:35,310
welcome to my channel

2
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:43,461
Today I continue to share how to quickly revive a rotten orchid like this.

3
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:48,960
All the leaves are rotten.

4
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:13,088
This flower has also dried.

5
00:01:13,088 --> 00:01:21,102
The top of the flower is still fresh so I decided to leave it to propagate from this flower

6
00:01:23,245 --> 00:01:45,049
Next, cut off all the damaged roots.

7
00:01:47,218 --> 00:01:55,819
Although the orchid has rotted, there are still some fresh roots

8
00:01:56,962 --> 00:02:02,813
Rinse with plain water

9
00:02:05,076 --> 00:02:08,451
take 1 aloe leaf

10
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:16,721
add 2 cloves of germinated garlic,

11
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:25,312
If you don't have germinated garlic, you can substitute it with regular garlic,

12
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:30,337
Garlic sprouts contain very rich AUXIN content

13
00:02:30,337 --> 00:02:36,142
AUXIN is a plant growth stimulant

14
00:02:36,142 --> 00:02:46,841
so it will help the orchid respawn very quickly

15
00:02:54,452 --> 00:02:57,002
add about 30g of aloe leaves

16
00:02:58,716 --> 00:03:02,916
add 1 liter of water

17
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:08,269
puree

18
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:22,710
filter out residue

19
00:03:27,483 --> 00:03:32,234
Soak orchids in this water for 20 minutes

20
00:03:40,337 --> 00:03:49,213
I recycle plastic bottles as tools to revive orchids

21
00:03:50,653 --> 00:04:00,000
This recycling tool will also contribute to creating a favorable environment for the orchid to revive quickly,

22
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:10,320
It also helps to reduce environmental pollution

23
00:04:20,446 --> 00:04:31,523
wash

24
00:04:59,658 --> 00:05:17,612
make vents

25
00:05:37,460 --> 00:06:14,578
Use dry pine bark

26
00:06:21,845 --> 00:06:26,282
let dry for 1 week without watering

27
00:06:26,282 --> 00:06:34,701
The dry pine bark will absorb moisture to help protect the orchid from further rot

28
00:06:38,316 --> 00:06:43,923
AFTER 1 WEEK

29
00:06:47,737 --> 00:07:07,124
Now start watering to keep the orchid moist

30
00:07:22,846 --> 00:07:26,987
Every 5 days, spray mist to keep the orchid moist

31
00:07:26,987 --> 00:07:35,075
and put in a cool place to spread recovery

32
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:47,349
AFTER 3 WEEKS

33
00:08:06,178 --> 00:08:16,744
Sprout has revived

34
00:08:16,744 --> 00:08:28,276
and the roots are also revived

35
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:50,187
Continue periodically for 5 days misting to keep the orchid moist

36
00:08:51,175 --> 00:08:54,978
Continue to keep in a cool place for the spread to recover

37
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:06,651
AFTER 2 MONTHS

38
00:09:11,364 --> 00:09:20,014
Lan has revived and grown healthy

39
00:09:23,077 --> 00:09:27,331
With this approach, orchids will have the right environment to grow

40
00:09:27,331 --> 00:09:34,987
Steam from below always evaporates, creating the right moisture for orchids to revive and grow.

41
00:09:36,986 --> 00:09:45,185
Hope this content will help you take care of orchids at home better

42
00:09:46,184 --> 00:09:55,882
After only 3 months they can bloom again

43
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:08,880
