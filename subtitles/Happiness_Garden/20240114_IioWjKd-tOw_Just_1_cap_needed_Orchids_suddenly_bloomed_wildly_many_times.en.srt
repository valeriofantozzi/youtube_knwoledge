Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:12,898
In this video, I share how to fertilize to help flower branches continue to revive and bloom after the flowers wither.

3
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:36,893
Please subscribe to the channel so you don't miss any orchid growing tips on my channel.

4
00:00:43,557 --> 00:00:51,890
These are the branches after the flowers have faded.

5
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:02,321
All the flowers have fallen.

6
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:16,885
I cut off all the dry branches.

7
00:01:43,013 --> 00:01:51,878
Then sprinkle cinnamon powder on the cut and leave for 1 day without watering.

8
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:57,877
This helps the cut heal quickly.

9
00:02:00,877 --> 00:02:08,875
then take 2 liters of water.

10
00:02:13,803 --> 00:02:21,872
and take 20ml of milk.

11
00:02:21,872 --> 00:02:31,870
Nitrogen is a major component of proteins and other compounds important in plant biological processes.

12
00:02:46,168 --> 00:02:50,900
Step 1: Clean the leaves with this water.

13
00:02:53,351 --> 00:03:00,898
Milk has the ability to shine and clean leaves.

14
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:10,896
When you wipe orchid leaves with milk, it will help remove dirt and sebum.

15
00:03:12,868 --> 00:03:21,894
and other pollutants on the leaves, helping orchids become cleaner and more active.

16
00:03:39,348 --> 00:03:46,889
Then take 2 cloves of garlic.

17
00:04:01,065 --> 00:04:11,051
This type of sprout will have a lot of Auxin to help stimulate plant growth.

18
00:04:13,852 --> 00:04:23,882
Garlic has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties, helping to prevent the growth of pathogens harmful to orchids.

19
00:04:51,226 --> 00:04:58,875
then mix it into this water.

20
00:05:17,732 --> 00:05:26,869
Step 2: Water the orchid once a week.

21
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:40,900
Milk and garlic also provide phosphorus, an important nutrient that enhances root growth and cell division.

22
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:51,897
Phosphorus is an important part of a plant's reproductive and energy processes.

23
00:05:53,467 --> 00:06:03,895
Milk and garlic also contain potassium, which helps improve plant health and increase resistance against diseases.

24
00:06:06,882 --> 00:06:16,893
Step 3: Spray this water on the orchid once a week.

25
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:34,889
Milk also contains beneficial organic matter that helps improve soil structure and enhance plants' ability to absorb nutrients.

26
00:06:38,972 --> 00:06:48,886
Spray evenly on branches to stimulate flower bud growth.

27
00:06:54,439 --> 00:07:03,883
Then leave it on the windowsill or under a sun filter.

28
00:07:13,037 --> 00:07:16,881
1 MONTH LATER.

29
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:33,877
From the dry branches, many flower buds continue to grow.

30
00:07:48,622 --> 00:07:58,872
And this method will help orchids bloom many times a year.

31
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:18,868
Continue watering the orchid once a week with this water.

32
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:38,898
and continue to spray the orchid with this water once a week.

33
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,888
AFTER NEXT 1 MONTH.

34
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:38,886
Orchids have bloomed a lot.

35
00:09:43,652 --> 00:09:52,883
Flower colors are vibrant and last long.

36
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:07,880
