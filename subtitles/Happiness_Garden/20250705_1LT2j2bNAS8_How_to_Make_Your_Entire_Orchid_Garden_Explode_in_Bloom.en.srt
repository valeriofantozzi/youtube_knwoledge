00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,080

153
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,360
I will cut across this old flower stem

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,000
to begin the process of propagating the

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,000
orchid through cutings.

156
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,080
We need to cut neatly to avoid crushing

157
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,839

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,200

This helps the cut to heal, reducing the

194
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,160
risk of infection and creating optimal

195
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,160
conditions for root development later

196
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,160
on.

197
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,040
Then apply a special plant glue to the

198
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,200
cut, which helps prevent water from

199
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,440
seeping into the wound. This will

200
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,760
protect the cut from bacteria and mold,

201
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,640
thus preventing rot and allowing the new

202
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,959
plant to grow healthily.

203
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,120
Then place the cutting in a cool well

204
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,959
ventilated area to allow the glue to dry

205
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,720
completely.

206
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,279
This will help the glue dry evenly and

207
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,959
form a solid protective layer preventing

208
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,760
bacterial infection and supporting

209
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,760
better growth of the plant.

210
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,440
While waiting for the glue to dry

211
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,320
completely, take one teaspoon of

212
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,480
cinnamon powder and soak it in one lit

213
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:12,360

214
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,360

215
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,959
Cinnamon powder has antibacterial and

216
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,120
antifungal properties, helping to clean

217
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,760
the growing medium, prevent the growth

218
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:28,040
of harmful bacteria, and create a safe

219
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,040
environment for the cutting to develop.

221
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,360
After the water cools, filter out the

222
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,720
residue to leave only the clear liquid

223
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,519

growing medium.

225
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,959
This ensures that the growing medium

226
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,120
will not be contaminated with

227
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,880
impurities, providing the best

228
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,880

Then soak the dry moss in the cinnamon

232
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,279
water for about 20 minutes. This will

233
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,360
help the moss of absorb nutrients from

234
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,760
the cinnamon water while also

235
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,200
disinfecting it and creating a good

The moss has now been treated and is

241
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:53,000
ready to be used as a growing medium for

242
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,000
rooting orchid cutings.

243
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,320
I have recycled a plastic bottle to

244
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,320
create a mini greenhouse which helps

247
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,440
orchid cutings. Here I have created

248
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,160
ventilation holes in the plastic bottle

249
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,720

excessive moisture buildup.

water from accumulating which could

254
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,440
cause root rot in the cutings.

After placing the moss inside, we will

insert the cutting and mist it regularly

258
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,240
