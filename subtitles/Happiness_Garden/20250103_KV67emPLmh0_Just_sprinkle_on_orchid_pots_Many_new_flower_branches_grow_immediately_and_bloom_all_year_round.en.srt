14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,760
plant can become stunted and grow slowly

15
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:47,680
so postflowering care is very important

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,510
to help the plant recover and prepare

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:55,670

the cinnamon water and gently wipe the

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,440
top and bottom surfaces of the

00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:23,720
wipe off any excess water from the

96
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,720

quickly improving the plant's ability to

100
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,039
photosynthesize and

101
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,399
exchange reduces the risk of the Orchid

102
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,399
getting sick due to prolonged damp

the surface of the Orchid pot to to

107
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,270
retain moisture and create a better

00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,120
maintain moisture balance and prevents

112
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,720
the plant from losing water too quickly

113
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,720
