Welcome to my channel where we explore

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,160
the beauty of orchids together and learn

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,840
how to care for them in a gentle,

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,599
natural, and loving way.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,519
Today, I will share how to take care of

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,599
a newly purchased orchid, helping it

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,119
quickly adapt, grow strong from the

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,520
start, and avoid stress.

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,680
I bought this orchid for just $1 at a

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:27,359
small local flower shop. A small gift,

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,439
but full of hope for my garden.

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,279
You can see that there is still a lot of

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,480
mineral salt residue on the leaf

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:39,079
surface, making the leaves look dull and

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,079
lose their natural glossy green color.

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,360
Looking through the transparent pot, we

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,160
can see many new roots growing. But to

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,520
be sure the plant is truly healthy, we

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,280
still need to carefully check the

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,680
growing medium and the condition of the

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,680
roots inside.

You can see that alongside the new roots

24
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,920
growing, there are also many old roots

25
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,440
that have become hollow and no longer

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,870
function to nourish the plant.

38
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,520
From a quick inspection, I see that the

39
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,399
growing medium is quite dry and not

40
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,000
water logged. However, for the plant to

41
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,000
grow its best, we should remove about

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,910
half of the old medium and repot the

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:02,150
plant into a new, larger pot.

[Music]

45
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,040
It's best to remove the moss in the core

46
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,640
as this moss retains moisture for too

47
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,430
long, which can easily cause the roots

48
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:23,459
to suffocate and rot.

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,360
After that, cut off all the damaged,

rotten, and hollow roots to help the

52
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,319

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,319

in the growing medium before repotting

84
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,519

Not only does it eliminate fungus, but

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,440
the baking soda solution also helps

192
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,480
Step two, pour the fermented rice water

193
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,600
mixture into a spray bottle for easy

194
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,600
application on the orchid leaves.

195
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:48,480
[Music]

196
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,279
Um, when spraying fermented rice water

197
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,079
on both the top and bottom surfaces of

198
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,160
the leaves, it helps remove dust and any

199
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,760
remaining fungi on the leaf surface,

200
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,079
especially in spots that weren't

201
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:03,800
thoroughly wiped. This keeps the leaves

202
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,800
clean and healthy.

203
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,440
The vitamins, enzymes, and beneficial

204
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,680
microorganisms in the rice water are

205
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,519
absorbed by the leaves when sprayed,

206
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,079
allowing the leaves to take in nutrients

207
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:22,440
directly, uh, promoting photosynthesis

208
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,440
and boosting the plant's vitality.

209
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,720
Regular spraying helps form a thin

210
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,800
protective layer on the leaves,

211
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,959
preventing fungi from redeveloping and

212
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,800
keeping the leaves clean and shiny,

213
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:41,160
creating an ideal environment for the

214
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,160
orchid to grow vigorously.

215
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,720
Step three, water the fermented rice

216
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,959
water mixture directly onto the roots

217
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,880
and growing medium, providing natural

218
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,880
nutrients to the orchid from within.

219
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,920
Watering the fermented rice water

220
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,360
mixture directly onto the roots and

221
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,680
growing medium provides natural

222
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,639
nutrients, stimulates strong root

223
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,639
growth, enhances nutrient absorption,

224
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,639
and improves the overall vitality of the

225
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,639
orchid.

226
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:20,320
[Music]

227
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,240
Perform all three steps twice a month.

228
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,079
In addition, water the orchid whenever

229
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,240
the growing medium is dry and place the

230
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:30,120
pot in a spot with gentle sunlight to

231
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,120
help the plant grow healthy.

232
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:46,480
[Music]

233
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,650
And here are the results after 3 weeks

234
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,289
of care.

235
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:52,289
[Music]

236
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,040
Uh you can see many new roots have grown

237
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,440
healthy and ready to support the plant's

238
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,440
vigorous growth.

239
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:10,590
[Music]

240
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:18,560
These new roots are growing strong,

241
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,639
dense, and display white, pink, and

242
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,320
fresh green colors, indicating that the

243
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,800
plant is recovering and growing very

244
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,800
well.

245
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,120
They not only help the plant stay stable

246
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,120
in the pot, but also create a solid

247
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,839
foundation for the leaves and flowers to

248
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,839
grow in the coming weeks.

249
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,680
The leaves have become lush and glossy,

250
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,560
reflecting fresh vitality after the care

251
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,480
process.

252
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,000
Glossy green leaves help the plant

253
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,839
absorb light better, enhance

254
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,680
photosynthesis, and nourish the new

255
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,680
roots, young leaves, and flower buds.

256
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,839
What do you think about the way I care

257
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,440
for my newly purchased orchid? Please

258
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,000

feedback for me.

260
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
If you care for your orchids with all

261
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,240
the love you have for plants, they will

262
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,440
respond with strong roots, lush green

263
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,199
leaves, and vibrant, lively flowers.

[Music]

265
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,199
The flowers will bloom, spreading

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:24,399
fragrance and vibrant colors as a reward

267
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:26,720
