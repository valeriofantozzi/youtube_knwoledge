Hi everyone. To give you more options

00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,839
for taking care of your orchids at home,

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:12,280
today I'll be sharing a new way to make

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:18,439
a natural fertilizer. It's simple and

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,160

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,160

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,119
Then cut off all the damaged roots.

19
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,560
Damaged, rotting, or moldy roots can be

20
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,360
a breeding ground for bacteria and

21
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,960
fungi, which can harm the entire plant.

22
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,510
Cutting them off helps prevent the

23
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,979
spread of disease.

When you cut off the damaged roots, the

27
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,799
plant won't waste energy on

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,280
nonfunctioning roots, allowing it to

29
00:01:52,799 --> 00:02:05,079

When you cut off the old flower spikes,

34
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,319
the plant will focus its energy on

35
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,480
growing new flower spikes, helping it to

36
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,130

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,360
impurities from the leaves and stem,

42
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,360
reducing the risk of the plant getting

43
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,360
infected.

44
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,560
Washing the plant also helps improve air

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,159
circulation for the leaves and stem,

46
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,239

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,599
Then place the wilted orchid in a

50
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,000
container and soak it in water for about

51
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,760
1 hour. This helps the plant absorb

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,680
moisture into the roots and leaves,

53
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,840
especially when the plant is dry or

54
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,900

55
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:49,089

94
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,840
cinnamon water helps clean off potential

Here a new flower spike has

194
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:20,679
emerged. And over here, a large flower

195
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,679
spike has developed and grown long.

196
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,199
It's wonderful to see a weak orchid

197
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,600
recover, grow strong, and continue to

198
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,960
bloom. After a period of meticulous

199
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,640
care, from reviving the roots, regular

200
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:35,200
fertilizing to protecting the plant from

201
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,840
harmful factors, the orchid has overcome

202
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,240
difficulties and shows its vibrant life

203
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,880
through beautiful blooms. Watching the

204
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,120
healthy orchid thrive and flower is an

205
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,840
invaluable joy, the result of patience

206
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,760
and love for nature. Each flower that

207
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,600
blooms is a testament to the care and

208
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,600
perseverance making us feel proud and

209
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,600
happy.
