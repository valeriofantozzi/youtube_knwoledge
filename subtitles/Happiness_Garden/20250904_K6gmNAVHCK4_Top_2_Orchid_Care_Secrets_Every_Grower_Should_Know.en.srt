[Music]

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,600
To start making natural fertilizer,

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,720
simply take one liter of warm water and

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,720
pour it into a clean bottle.

[Music]

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,200
The first ingredient you need to add is

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,360
molasses. This is a natural sugar source

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,520
rich in minerals that helps nourish

33
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,080
beneficial microorganisms in the

34
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,240
fertilizer.

35
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,000
With just one teaspoon of molasses, you

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,680
create the ideal conditions for the

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,680
fermentation process to occur naturally.

This type of sugar not only activates

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,840
beneficial microorganisms but also helps

41
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,840
create a nutrient-rich environment that

42
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,750
supports orchid roots to grow quickly,

The next ingredient you need to prepare

46
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,920
is oatmeal. It is a natural and healthy

47
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,319
source of starch that when combined with

48
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,680
molasses creates an ideal environment

49
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,520
for beneficial microorganisms to thrive.

51
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,800
Just add 3 tsp of oatmeal to the bottle

52
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,800
and that's enough.

53
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,400
Then stir well to dissolve the oatmeal

54
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:30,320
evenly in the water, making the

55
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:33,470
fermentation process smoother.

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,840
Next, simply close the bottle and let it

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,440
sit in a warm place for about 1 to 2

59
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,280

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,120
During this time, the microorganisms

61
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,879
will begin to work, transforming the

62
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,290

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,400
The first method is to use a soft cloth

impurities that have accumulated on the

leaf surface.

When sprayed evenly on both leaf

158
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,720

the plant absorb nutrients more quickly

160
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,800

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,199

and come into direct contact with the

189

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,240
promotes the decomposition of organic

197
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,399
suppresses the growth of harmful

198
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,080

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,399
for nutrient absorption. So, when

208
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,080
A healthy root system is the solid

209
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,600
foundation for vigorous plant growth and

210
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,600
proper preparation for the blooming

the growing medium retains just the

right amount of moisture and becomes

216
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,519

entire orchid pot in the mixture for

221
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,140

Standing water in the leaf axles or

breeding ground for fungi and bacteria,

238
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:18,360

in humid weather or during the night.

240
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,200
Timely drying helps the plant avoid

keep the orchid clean, preventing

246
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,640
yellowing or discoloration on the leaves

247
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,600
caused by residue left behind as the

248
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,079
water evaporates.

249
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,600
At the same time, a well- ventilated dry

250
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,399
environment will limit the development

251
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,839
of white mold, black mold, and other

252
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,839

254
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,440
Fermented fertilizer should be applied

255
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,440
in the morning. This is when the orchid

256
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,160
begins its most active metabolic

257
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,680
processes of the day, allowing it to

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,920
absorb nutrients more effectively.

259
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,240
At the same time, sunlight helps the

260
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,079
leaves and roots dry quickly, reducing

261
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,079
the risk of fungal infections or root

262
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,079
rot.

263
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,639
And finally, remember to place the

264
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,079
orchid pot in a spot with gentle

265
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,480

266
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,639
photosynthesize well.

267
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,800
When exposed to natural light, orchids

268
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,120
can convert nutrients into energy,

269
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:35,880

386
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,640
Method one,

387
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,640
water the orchid with this liquid

388
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,640

Rice water contains amino acids and

391
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,640
beneficial microorganisms which help

392
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:26,520
strengthen the soil microbiome thereby

393
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,520
stimulating root growth.

improves soil irerration and moisture

397
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:57,000
retention, helping plants absorb water

398
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,000
and nutrients.

399
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,960
Beneficial bacteria in the fermentation

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:20,600
process help orchids increase their

401
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,600
resistance to diseases.

402
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,559
Abundant nutrients and a fresh living

403
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:32,840
environment help orchids bloom more,

404
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,840
bigger, and more beautifully.

405
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:43,720
After watering, soaking in this water

406
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,720
for about 20 minutes is best.

407
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,480
Method two,

408
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,200
use soft cotton to absorb this water and

409
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,440
thoroughly wipe the top and bottom of

410
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,440
the leaves.

411
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,080
Wiping leaves helps remove dirt and

412
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,080
impurities, helps plants photosynthesize

413
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,559
better, and increases their ability to

414
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,559
absorb light.

415
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,200
Beneficial bacteria in the solution help

416
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:47,320
strengthen plant resistance, reducing

417
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,320
the risk of pests and diseases.

This solution creates light moisture on

the leaf surface, helping plants

421
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:24,269
maintain moisture and prevent wilting.

In addition, when wiping the leaves, the

425
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,679
organic substances in the solution will

426
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,679
be absorbed through the leaves.

If you have many orchid pots, put this

water in a spray bottle.

435
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,240

[Music]

445
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,000
However, you should not spray it on

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,480
Because when flowers get wet, the petals

449
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,480
will quickly fall off.

00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,159
the orchid pot out and place it in a

453
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,730
place with lots of scattered light so

454
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:59,200
the orchid can photosynthesize well.

promoting flower formation.

472
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,679
