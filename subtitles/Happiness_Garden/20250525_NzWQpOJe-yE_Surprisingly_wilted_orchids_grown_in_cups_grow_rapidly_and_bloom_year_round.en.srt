from used chamomile tea bags, rice, and

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,240
baking soda. This trick will not only

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,320
help your plant grow from the roots,

Before fertilizing, you should

23
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,920
thoroughly water the plant and and soak

the orchid pot in water for about 20

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,119

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,680
water better and reduces the risk of

27
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,680
fertilizer shock.

59
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,480
natural fertilizer that is excellent for

60
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,680
