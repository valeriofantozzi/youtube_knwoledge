00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,120
Welcome to the happiness garden, where

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,000
every leaf and every flower tells its

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,240
own story. Here we learn together how to

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,639
care for plants, observe every small

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,480
signal that nature sends, and feel the

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,240
joy of watching the plants grow day by

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,480
day.

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,960
Uh, every step of care, no matter how

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,640
small, brings new life. And it is the

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,640
love for the plants that helps them

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,880
bloom brilliantly.

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,199
Let's explore together the simple yet

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,359
highly effective secrets to keep your

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,359
garden always full of vitality and

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,359
happiness.

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,879
Today I want to share with you how to

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,719
care for newly purchased orchids so that

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,840
they quickly adapt to their new

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,320
environment and grow healthily. Every

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,039
step from choosing a pot, checking the

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,879
roots to watering and gently fertilizing

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,600
is very important to prevent the plants

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,600
from experiencing stress.

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,960
After bringing your orchid home, let it

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,800
rest for a few hours in a well

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,280
ventilated place to reduce the stress

27
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,280
caused by transportation.

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,320
Once the plant has settled, you should

29
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,000
check the roots and the growing medium

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,400
to see if they are healthy or need

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,280
replacing so the plant has the best

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,280
environment to grow. Although simple,

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,960
this step is very important because

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,680
healthy roots help the plant absorb

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,540
nutrients effectively and bloom

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,439
beautifully later.

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,680
[Music]

38
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,079
First, I will trim the damaged roots,

39
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,320
the parts that are rotting or dry, so

40
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,080
the plant does not waste energy on roots

41
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,310
that are no longer alive.

42
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,310
[Music]

43
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,600
Upon initial inspection, I found that

44
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,240
the moss medium was still loose, so a

45
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,320
complete replacement was not necessary.

46
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,920
However, since moss retains quite a lot

47
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,240
of moisture, this is really only

48
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,240
suitable for industrial orchid gardens

49
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,240
where the water amount is very precisely

50
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,240
controlled.

51
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,040
When planting at home, to help the plant

52
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,039
grow more healthily, I will remove about

53
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,800
half of the moss, which not only

54
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,440
prevents the roots from being water

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,120
logged, but also creates more space for

56
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,680
the plant to breathe and absorb

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,680
nutrients better.

58
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,400
After removing about half of the moss, I

59
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,120
will proceed to plant the orchid in a

60
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,920
new pot. I choose a pot with drainage

61
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,120
holes at the bottom and a moderate size,

62
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,280
not too wide nor too tight, so the roots

63
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,840
have enough space to grow while still

64
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,319
retaining proper moisture. Choosing the

65
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,480
right pot size is very important as it

66
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,840
helps the plant grow evenly and prevents

67
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,840
water logging or nutrient deficiency.

68
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,680
To supplement the growing medium, I

69
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,080
choose crushed pine bark because when

70
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,000
combined with moss, it creates a perfect

71
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,270
balance between irration and moisture

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,489
retention.

73
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:05,489
[Music]

74
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,000
Pine bark provides space for the roots

75
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,080
to grow, preventing water logging while

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,560
the moss still supplies enough moisture

77
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,800
for the plant. This combination helps

78
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,360
the orchid grow healthily with strong

79
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,700
roots, green leaves, and prepares it for

80
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:30,169
the upcoming flower buds.

[Music]

82
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,040
Uh when adding pine bark into the pot,

83
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,799
gently tap the sides of the pot to help

84
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,840
the medium settle evenly around the

85
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,519
roots without crushing or damaging them.

86
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,120
This ensures the roots are firmly

87
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,720
secured while still maintaining the

88
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,519
necessary erration for the plant to

89
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,920
absorb nutrients and grow healthily.

90
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,920
These small but careful actions create a

91
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,480
solid foundation for the orchid to bloom

92
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:58,879
beautifully later.

ingredient for making natural fertilizer

100
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,759
for orchids. You only need a small

101
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,100
slice, but it provides enough nutrients

102
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,440

slice, preparing for the next step in

116
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,080
making natural fertilizer for orchids.

117
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,759
Orange juice is rich in vitamins and

118
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,000
minerals, helping the plant absorb

119
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,000
nutrients quickly and grow healthily.

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,759
Even a small amount is enough to nourish

[Music]

124
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,520
After squeezing the juice, dilute it

125
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,199
with about one liter of water to create

126
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,000
a gentle nutrient solution for the

127
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,560
orchid. Diluting it allows the plant to

128
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,400
absorb nutrients safely, preventing a

129
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,560
too concentrated solution from harming

130
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,560
the roots.

131
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,320
With just this simple solution, you

132
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,639
provide the essential vitamins and

133
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,240
minerals, helping the leaves stay lush

134
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,240
and preparing the plant for vibrant

135
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,240
blooms.

136
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,600
Method one, use a soft cloth soaked in

137
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,919
the diluted orange juice solution. Then,

138
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,800
gently wipe both the top and bottom

139
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,800
surfaces of the leaves.

140
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,960
This allows the nutrients to be absorbed

141
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,520
directly through the leaves while also

142
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,080
cleaning dust and bacteria, creating the

143
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,240
best conditions for healthy leaf growth.

144
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,240
Handle each leaf carefully so the plant

145
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,240
feels gentle care and absorbs nutrients

146
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,240
effectively.

147
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,440
When you wipe the leaves with the

148
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,280
diluted orange juice solution, it allows

149
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,440
nutrients to be absorbed directly into

150
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,199
the leaves, providing essential vitamins

151
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,360
and minerals.

152
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,080
This stimulates healthy, lush leaf

153
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,759
growth and enhances photosynthesis,

154
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,759
helping the plant absorb light more

155
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,759
effectively.

156
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,000
Wiping the leaves also helps remove

157
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,720
dust, bacteria, and tiny insects on the

158
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,880
leaf surface. This keeps the leaves

159
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,039
clean and well ventilated, reducing the

160
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:53,319
risk of disease and creating favorable

161
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,319
conditions for vibrant, healthy blooms.

162
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,680
After wiping each leaf, let the plant

163
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,440
rest for a while so the solution can be

164
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,080
absorbed evenly and the leaves dry

165
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,000
naturally.

166
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,080
This not only helps the leaves absorb

167
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,919
nutrients better, but also prevents

168
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,850
water from pooling, which could harm the

169
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:16,819
roots or flower buds.

[Music]

171
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,039
Method two, you can directly water this

172
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,440
natural fertilizer mixture onto the

173
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,199
roots and growing medium. This allows

174
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,840
the nutrients to penetrate down to the

175
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,599
roots where the plant absorbs them best

176
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:37,080
while also softening the medium and

177
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,080
balancing moisture.

178
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,479
Oranges contain many important vitamins

179
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,720
and minerals helping the roots grow

180
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:50,199
healthily and enhancing the plant's

181
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,199
overall nourishment.

182
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,800
Uh in addition, the solution softens the

183
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,560
growing medium making the soil and moss

184
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,120
more airrated while balancing the

185
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,120
moisture around the roots. When the

186
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,120
medium is sufficiently airy, the roots

187
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,879
won't be water logged or suffocated,

188
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,879
allowing the plant to grow evenly and

189
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,879
healthily.

190
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,520
Finally, evenly watering this mixture

191

mixture into a spray bottle and lightly

203
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,600
mist the plant. This allows the solution

204
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,920
to cover the leaves, flowers, and even

205
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,399

providing essential vitamins and

212
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,279
minerals. This promotes lush green

213
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,600

dust and bacteria from the leaves while

218
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,240
creating a natural protective layer.

219
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,760
When the leaves are clean and well

220
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,279
ventilated, the plant absorbs light

221
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,279

224
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,480
angles, stimulating the roots, leaves,

225
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,399
and flower buds to develop evenly. As a

226
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,560
result, the orchid becomes healthy,

227
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:16,279

233
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,440
If there is still water on the leaves,

234
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,440
gently wipe off the excess with a soft

235
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,440
cloth.

236
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,959
Once the leaves are dry and clean, your

237
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,200
orchid is ready for the next care steps.

238

photosynthesize without burning the

247
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,160
