00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,240
Welcome to the happiness garden. Um,

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,720
today I want to share with you how to

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,480
care for weak plants at home, helping

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,480
them gradually recover and become

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,480
healthy.

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,800
Uh, when properly cared for, each leaf

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,560
will become greener, each root stronger,

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,960
and finally, vibrant flowers will

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,199
appear, bringing joy and color to your

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,199
living space.

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,720
With this simple yet effective method,

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,519
you will see seemingly weak plants begin

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,239
to revive day by day. Each young root

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,399
stretches upward. Each leaf turns a

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,960
fresh green. And then the bright flowers

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,520
will gradually bloom. Join me on the

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,440
journey of caring for, restoring, and

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,719
enjoying the wonderful beauty that each

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,719
plant brings to your home.

20
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,760
You can see this is a weak anthetherium

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,840
plant, almost lifeless. Many leaves and

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,360
flowers have rotted, leaving only a few

23
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,239
fresh leaves that can sustain the

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,160
plant's life. However, with proper care,

25
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,980
we can still help the plant recover and

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,240
bloom again.

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,799
And you can see on the surface of the

29
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,960
orchid pot there is a snail. They often

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,119
come to eat the roots and young leaves,

31
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,000
especially when it rains or the humidity

32
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,759
is high. If not dealt with promptly, the

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,759
plant can easily get fungal infections

34
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,600
from the bites, leading to rot and

35
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:30,700
weakening the plant's vitality.

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,880
Uh to protect the enththerium plant, we

38
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,720
need to remove the snails immediately

39
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,720
and carefully check the surface of the

40
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,720
soil.

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,759
Then we gently remove the damaged leaves

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,240
so that the enththerium plant does not

43
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,640
waste energy on the parts that are

44
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,640
already dead.

This helps the plant focus its energy on

the roots and the remaining healthy

49
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,239

53
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,879
You need to carefully check and cut off

54
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,040
any part of the stem that has rotted. If

55
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,280
not treated promptly, the rot can spread

56
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,920
and damage the entire anthetherium

57
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,319
plant. Removing the diseased parts from

58
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,640
the start will help the plant focus its

59
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,640
energy on the healthy parts and recover

60
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,640

have you along on this journey.

71
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:47,760
Next, carefully check the roots and

72
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,599
growing medium of the antherum plant.

73
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,680
Upon inspection, you can see that the

74
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,000
anthetherum's roots are still healthy

75
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,560
and the growing medium remains well

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,040
ventilated. Therefore, at this stage, it

77
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,159
is not necessary to repot or change the

78
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,879
medium. Just focus on carefully caring

79
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,480
for the plant so it can recover. When

80
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,480
the roots are healthy and the soil is

81
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,799
well airrated, the plant will absorb

82
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,400
nutrients better and bloom again soon.

83
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,720
You can see that beneficial

84
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,040
microorganisms in the growing medium are

85
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,040
working very well. This shows that the

86
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,440
medium is still rich in nutrients and

87
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,759
biologically balanced, helping the

88
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,680
anthetherium's roots develop healthily.

89
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,759
When the root environment is stable, the

90
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,960
plant will recover more easily and be

91
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:47,589
ready for the beautiful flowers to come.

Next, take a teaspoon of baking soda to

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,919
make a mixture which is used to treat

95
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,240
the old growing medium. This mixture

96
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:01,520
helps loosen the medium and adjusts the

97
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,199
pH to an ideal level, creating a perfect

98
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,520
environment for the anthetherium's roots

99
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,520
to absorb nutrients and recover quickly.

100
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,930
Add one liter of water to make the

101
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:33,730

over the entire growing medium, the

105
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,080

106
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,080
cut.

When the leaves are well cared for and

195
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,519
After extracting the aloe gel, place it

196
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,360
in a clean container to prepare it for

197
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:49,079
making a fertilizer solution for the

anthetherium plant.

199
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,320
The final ingredient is rice. Rice

200
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,800
contains many amino acids and especially

201
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,800
vitamin B1 which is very good for weak

00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,800
anththeriums.

203
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,480
You only need to take 3 tablespoons of

204
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,480
rice. This rice will be combined with

205
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,040
the alo gel to create a natural

206
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,920
nutrient-rich fertilizer solution for

207
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,160
the antherum. When mixed properly, the

208
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,000
solution will help the roots and new

209
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,880
leaves grow healthily while promoting

210
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,880
the plant's rapid recovery.

211
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,320
Then pour into one liter of water along

212
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,640

214
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,320
light fermentation.

215
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,760

release the vitamins and nutrients in

217
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,160
the rice and aloe, creating a

218
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,880
nutrientrich fertilizer solution for the

219
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,880
anthetherium. When used, this solution

220
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,440
will help the roots, leaves, and new

221
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,170

226
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,800

smooth and easy to penetrate the roots

230
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,800

231
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,760
the residue from causing blockages or

232
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,920
mold. When using the strain solution,

233
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,399
the antherum will absorb nutrients more

234
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:36,120
effectively, promoting healthy growth of

235
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:40,840

every 2 weeks. Regular fertilization

241
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,560
provides continuous nutrients,

242
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,120
stimulating healthy growth of roots,

243
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,279

244
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,440
