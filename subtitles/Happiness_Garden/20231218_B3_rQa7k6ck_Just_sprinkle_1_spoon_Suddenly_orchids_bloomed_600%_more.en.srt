00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:39,893
These are the branches after the flowers have faded.

5
00:00:42,337 --> 00:00:50,890
I cut off all the dry branches.

6
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:33,882
Then sprinkle cinnamon powder on the cut to help the wound heal quickly.

7
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:52,878
Then leave it for 1 day without watering to let the cut heal completely.

8
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:09,875
Take 1 aloe vera leaf and cut it into thin slices.

9
00:02:29,062 --> 00:02:39,869
Then I applied aloe vera gel to the spent flower stems.

10
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:48,867
This helps the flower branches recover very quickly.

11
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:56,899
I do it once a week.

12
00:03:02,772 --> 00:03:12,896
and I continue to apply aloe vera gel to the leaves once a week.

13
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:28,892

14
00:03:41,717 --> 00:03:51,888
I put sliced ​​aloe vera leaves in a jar and add 2 liters of boiled water.

15
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:04,885
Add 1 spoon of rice.

16
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:16,883
Then add 3 crushed egg shells.

17
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:27,881
Wait for the water to cool before you can use it.

18
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:55,875
After cooling, filter to remove residue.

19
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:12,872
Water this once a week.

20
00:05:16,111 --> 00:05:26,869

21
00:05:33,883 --> 00:05:42,899
Soak the orchid pot in this water for 20 minutes then take it out.

22
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:26,891

00:06:38,888 --> 00:06:48,886
At the same time, it effectively destroys disease-causing fungi and bacteria.

25
00:06:56,956 --> 00:07:02,883
After 20 minutes lift it out.

26
00:07:20,256 --> 00:07:23,879
After 1 month.

27
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:38,876
From withered branches, many new flower buds have grown.

28
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:52,874
 
This method helps the sprouts grow very quickly.

29
00:07:59,408 --> 00:08:08,870
After only 1 month, many buds have grown.

30
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:39,898

33
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:40,885
Even though the flower branches have withered, the newly bloomed flowers have very bright colors.

34
00:09:47,439 --> 00:09:57,882
The flowers are very healthy and sturdy so they will hang on the branches for a long time before fading.

35
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:10,880
With this simple method we can care for orchids at home and bloom all year round.
