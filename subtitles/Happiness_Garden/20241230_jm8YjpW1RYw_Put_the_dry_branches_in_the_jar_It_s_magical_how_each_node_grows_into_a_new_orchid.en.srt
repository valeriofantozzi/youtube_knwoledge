00:00:05,999 --> 00:00:09,932
This is dendrobium orchid.

an orchid that is said to be beautiful and has a gentle fragrance.

4
00:00:16,897 --> 00:00:23,888
They have the ability to bloom all year round and keep the flowers on the branches for a long time.

00:00:23,888 --> 00:00:32,627

10
00:01:47,663 --> 00:02:02,225
Apply toothpaste to the cut to help it heal quickly.

11
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:27,691
then wait for the toothpaste to dry.

12
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:41,490
Recycle plastic bottles into tools to stimulate rooting and sprouting.

15
00:03:54,198 --> 00:04:01,186
You can see the cut after applying the toothpaste has dried.

16
00:04:12,202 --> 00:04:20,182
Take 1 aloe vera leaf.

17
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:48,477
Apply aloe vera gel all over this dry orchid.

18
00:05:14,834 --> 00:05:21,803
Then wait for the aloe vera gel to dry.

19
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:49,531
Put the dry orchid branches into this plastic bottle.

20
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:31,290
Place the bottle here and insert moss around it to help retain moisture.

21
00:07:30,615 --> 00:07:40,609
Water regularly to keep the environment moist.

22
00:07:43,751 --> 00:07:52,740
This helps the orchid germinate faster.

23
00:08:14,347 --> 00:08:23,426
Then put it in a cool place and wait for the orchid to revive.

24
00:08:40,072 --> 00:08:46,063
2 MONTHS LATER

28
00:10:29,991 --> 00:10:39,974
Now I cut them out to plant in pots.

00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:03,433
Welcome to part 2 of the video!

36
00:12:03,903 --> 00:12:11,606
Today I share how to propagate orchids from old withered branches.

37
00:12:23,344 --> 00:12:35,497
This is a vegetable glue. It prevents water from seeping inside.

38
00:12:50,145 --> 00:13:00,000
You can also replace this glue by burning a candle and putting it on to prevent it from getting waterproof.

39
00:13:24,112 --> 00:13:33,577
Scrape off the outer membrane so that the sprouts are easy to germinate.

40
00:14:32,568 --> 00:14:39,346
You use 1 clove of garlic.

41
00:14:53,247 --> 00:15:00,622
Apply garlic juice to newly shaved areas to wake up the sprouts.

42
00:15:30,947 --> 00:15:37,575
I use a type of moss (the type of moss used to grow orchids).

43
00:15:38,014 --> 00:15:45,880
Fill with water and check the humidity.

44
00:16:00,808 --> 00:16:05,645
Put the orchid branch in.

45
00:16:07,602 --> 00:16:11,543
Cover up.

46
00:16:19,622 --> 00:16:26,205
Place it in a place that gets daylight but don't leave it in direct sunlight.

47
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:30,000
after 1 month.

48
00:16:50,155 --> 00:16:55,766
As you can see, from an old and withered orchid branch, 

49
00:16:55,766 --> 00:17:00,765
it has now been revived into many healthy orchid seedlings, 

50
00:17:00,765 --> 00:17:05,764
and they are growing very strong and rooting very well.

51
00:17:25,469 --> 00:17:33,358
Now plant in a pot so the orchid can grow in the outside environment.

52
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:40,737
