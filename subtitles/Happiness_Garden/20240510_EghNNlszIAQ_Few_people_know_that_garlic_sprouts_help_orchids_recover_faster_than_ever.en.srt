00:00:28,084 --> 00:00:35,310
welcome to my channel

2
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:43,461
Today I continue to share how to quickly revive a rotten orchid like this.

3
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:48,960
All the leaves are rotten.

4
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:13,088
This flower has also dried.

5
00:01:13,088 --> 00:01:21,102
The top of the flower is still fresh so I decided to leave it to propagate from this flower

6
00:01:23,245 --> 00:01:45,049
Next, cut off all the damaged roots.

7
00:01:47,218 --> 00:01:55,819
Although the orchid has rotted, there are still some fresh roots

8
00:01:56,962 --> 00:02:02,813
Rinse with plain water

9
00:02:05,076 --> 00:02:08,451
take 1 aloe leaf

10
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:16,721
add 2 cloves of germinated garlic,

11
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:25,312
If you don't have germinated garlic, you can substitute it with regular garlic,

12
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:30,337
Garlic sprouts contain very rich AUXIN content

13
00:02:30,337 --> 00:02:36,142
AUXIN is a plant growth stimulant

14
00:02:36,142 --> 00:02:46,841
so it will help the orchid respawn very quickly

15
00:02:54,452 --> 00:02:57,002
add about 30g of aloe leaves

16
00:02:58,716 --> 00:03:02,916
add 1 liter of water

17
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:08,269
puree

18
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:22,710
filter out residue

19
00:03:27,483 --> 00:03:32,234
Soak orchids in this water for 20 minutes

20
00:03:40,337 --> 00:03:49,213
I recycle plastic bottles as tools to revive orchids

21
00:03:50,653 --> 00:04:00,000
This recycling tool will also contribute to creating a favorable environment for the orchid to revive quickly,

22
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:10,320
It also helps to reduce environmental pollution

23
00:04:20,446 --> 00:04:31,523
wash

24
00:04:59,658 --> 00:05:17,612
make vents

25
00:05:37,460 --> 00:06:14,578
Use dry pine bark

26
00:06:21,845 --> 00:06:26,282
let dry for 1 week without watering

27
00:06:26,282 --> 00:06:34,701
The dry pine bark will absorb moisture to help protect the orchid from further rot

28
00:06:38,316 --> 00:06:43,923
AFTER 1 WEEK

29
00:06:47,737 --> 00:07:07,124
Now start watering to keep the orchid moist

30
00:07:22,846 --> 00:07:26,987
Every 5 days, spray mist to keep the orchid moist

31
00:07:26,987 --> 00:07:35,075
and put in a cool place to spread recovery

32
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:47,349
AFTER 3 WEEKS

33
00:08:06,178 --> 00:08:16,744
Sprout has revived

34
00:08:16,744 --> 00:08:28,276
and the roots are also revived

35
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:50,187
Continue periodically for 5 days misting to keep the orchid moist

36
00:08:51,175 --> 00:08:54,978
Continue to keep in a cool place for the spread to recover

37
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:06,651
AFTER 2 MONTHS

38
00:09:11,364 --> 00:09:20,014
Lan has revived and grown healthy

39
00:09:23,077 --> 00:09:27,331
With this approach, orchids will have the right environment to grow

40
00:09:27,331 --> 00:09:34,987
Steam from below always evaporates, creating the right moisture for orchids to revive and grow.

41
00:09:34,987 --> 00:09:44,185
Hope this content will help you take care of orchids at home better

00:10:02,807 --> 00:10:08,780
Now I will show you which fertilizer is best for orchids.

44
00:10:27,247 --> 00:10:36,241
it will help the orchid grow from roots, leaves and flowers

45
00:10:38,774 --> 00:10:48,772
There will be many flower buds growing after fertilizing

46
00:10:58,831 --> 00:11:00,870
Let's start

47
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:08,266
I used 5 cloves of garlic

48
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:18,799
is rich in nutrients such as Potassium, Magnesium, Calcium, Phosphorus,

49
00:11:19,386 --> 00:11:24,898
B vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B6)

50
00:11:24,898 --> 00:11:31,897
Garlic is a rich source of raw materials providing essential nutrients for growth

51
00:11:31,897 --> 00:11:35,254
and plant growth.

52
00:11:38,192 --> 00:11:46,161
Use an additional 30 grams of fresh potatoes

53
00:11:46,161 --> 00:11:52,623
Potatoes also contain many vitamins and amino acids

54
00:11:53,592 --> 00:12:01,591
and natural minerals such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium

55
00:12:01,591 --> 00:12:09,589
The starch content in potatoes also helps beneficial microorganisms grow

56
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:13,255
Helps protect healthy orchid roots

57
00:12:20,254 --> 00:12:40,250
I grind garlic and potatoes in 300 ml of water

58
00:12:50,248 --> 00:12:55,247
filter out residue

59
00:13:13,243 --> 00:13:33,239
Add water to get 3 liters of organic fertilizer solution from garlic and potatoes

60
00:14:11,265 --> 00:14:25,262
Put this organic fertilizer in a spray bottle

61
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:42,259
Spray the top and bottom of the leaves thoroughly

62
00:14:47,258 --> 00:14:56,256
When provided with this organic nutrition, orchids will grow very well

63
00:14:56,256 --> 00:15:05,255
Garlic contains strong essential oils and also has an acidic component,

64
00:15:05,255 --> 00:15:13,253
so it helps to repel insects and fungi very well

65
00:15:13,253 --> 00:15:20,252
Fertilizing once every 2 weeks will be very good for orchids

66
00:15:23,251 --> 00:15:28,250
Use this organic fertilizer to water the orchid pot

67
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:37,248
The potassium and phosphorus content will promote the growth of roots and flowers very quickly

68
00:15:37,248 --> 00:15:47,246
And the nitrogen in this organic fertilizer will help keep the leaves big and green

69
00:15:48,246 --> 00:15:52,245
Apply once every 2 weeks

70
00:15:55,245 --> 00:16:01,243
You can soak the orchid pot in this organic fertilizer for 20 minutes,

71
00:16:01,243 --> 00:16:07,242
so that the roots can absorb the most nutrients.

72
00:16:07,242 --> 00:16:10,242
Results after 1 month

73
00:16:10,242 --> 00:16:15,174
Many new roots grow

74
00:16:16,174 --> 00:16:24,172
New roots help orchids absorb water and nutrients better

75
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:37,170
When we provide nutrients, the roots will immediately absorb and transport to the entire orchid plant

76
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:50,200
if you fertilize once every 2 weeks in combination with other organic fertilizers that I have shared

77
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:58,199
I guarantee the orchid will always grow well

78
00:17:02,198 --> 00:17:11,196
Potassium in garlic and potatoes helps orchids bloom many flowers on the same branch

79
00:17:13,196 --> 00:17:23,194
Potassium helps to resist drought very well

80
00:17:25,193 --> 00:17:35,192
Potassium helps carry water from the roots to the highest and farthest parts of the orchid such as the tops and buds

81
00:17:35,192 --> 00:17:42,190
so the buds don't wilt due to lack of water

82
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:52,188
so the flower will keep on the branch for a long time without wilting

83
00:17:52,188 --> 00:17:58,187
Flowers can bloom up to 6 months without falling
