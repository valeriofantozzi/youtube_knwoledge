00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,899
Hello everyone, to easily care for orchids to always grow healthily.

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:15,897
There are more flower buds and flowers stay on the branches longer.

3
00:00:15,897 --> 00:00:24,896
Today I share a very easy way to keep orchids growing healthily.

4
00:00:32,894 --> 00:00:40,892
When eating bananas, don't throw away the peel.

5
00:00:40,892 --> 00:00:50,890
Because banana peels contain many nutrients, especially organic potassium.

6
00:00:50,890 --> 00:01:01,888
Very good for the growth of buds, flowers and has anti-drought effects.

7
00:01:05,408 --> 00:01:15,885
I cut the banana peel thinly and put it in a jar.

8
00:01:29,883 --> 00:01:36,881
Next I took a piece of bread.

9
00:01:36,881 --> 00:01:46,879
Bread contains phosphorus, which plays an important role in plant growth, especially stimulating root growth.

10
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:20,873
Adding 1 teaspoon of yeast helps decompose organic matter faster and prevents it from rotting.

11
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:32,870
And adding a spoonful of sugar helps nourish the growth of beneficial microorganisms.

12
00:02:34,295 --> 00:02:36,295
Add 500ml warm water.

13
00:02:56,899 --> 00:03:06,897
Then leave in a cool place for 3 weeks.

14
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:16,895
3 Weeks later.

15
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:26,893
Take 2 liters of water.

16
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:43,889
After 3 weeks of composting we have this wonderful fertilizer.

17
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:54,887
Take 50ml.

18
00:03:56,887 --> 00:04:06,885
then mix into water.

19
00:04:15,883 --> 00:04:20,882
Method 1: Fertilize the roots.

20
00:04:23,882 --> 00:04:33,880
Water each orchid pot with this water 5-10 spoons per week.

21
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:50,876
This fertilizer provides potassium, an important mineral that improves plant health and vitality.

22
00:05:00,096 --> 00:05:10,872
This type of fertilizer also helps retain water and enhances the plant's ability to absorb water.

23
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:26,869
Beneficial fungi Mycorrhiza will grow to help the plant more easily absorb nutrients from the orchid growing medium.

24
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:39,900
Method 2.

25
00:05:51,773 --> 00:05:58,896
Use this water to spray on the leaves.

26
00:06:04,778 --> 00:06:12,893
Helps supplement nutrients through leaves very effectively.

27
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:29,890
Helps orchid leaves become strong and healthy.

28
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:44,887
and sprayed on aerial roots to help aerial roots grow and easily absorb nutrients in the air.

29
00:06:50,641 --> 00:07:00,884
You should do it early in the morning and by noon the leaves will dry very quickly.

30
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:18,880
Do this once a week to keep the orchid healthy.

31
00:07:30,878 --> 00:07:33,877
Method 3:

32
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:42,875
Now I wash the leaves with this water.

33
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:56,873
Beneficial microorganisms will help kill mold and insects very effectively.

34
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:09,870
Do this every 2 weeks to protect your orchids.

35
00:08:24,867 --> 00:08:27,900
Result

36
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:39,898
After fertilizing, orchids will always be green and healthy.

37
00:08:48,815 --> 00:08:58,894
Potassium in banana peels and bread helps flower buds grow strongly.

38
00:09:08,892 --> 00:09:18,890
When the flowers bloom, they will stay on the branches for a long time.

39
00:09:26,888 --> 00:09:36,886
Flowers can last on branches for up to 6 months before fading.

40
00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:50,883
Hopefully the video will help you a lot in taking better care of orchids at home.

41
00:10:03,881 --> 00:10:11,879
Next I will show you how to revive a rotten orchid like this.

42
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:22,877
When the orchid has withered all the leaves, only the stem and roots remain, do not rush to throw it away.

43
00:10:50,872 --> 00:10:56,870
Here are still fresh roots.

44
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:22,899
First, cut off all damaged, rotten roots.

45
00:11:34,896 --> 00:11:56,892
Apply a molten candle on the cut so that the water does not penetrate the tree.

46
00:12:19,887 --> 00:12:33,885
Use 2 teaspoons of cinnamon powder.

47
00:12:41,883 --> 00:13:03,879
Add 1 liter of boiled water.

48
00:13:08,878 --> 00:13:18,876
Close the lid and wait for the water to cool.

49
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:31,873
The water has cooled down

50
00:13:31,873 --> 00:14:07,899
Filter out residue.

51
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:28,895
Soak orchids in this water for 30 minutes.

52
00:14:34,894 --> 00:15:11,887
The rest of the water I will spray on other orchids to help protect the orchid from insects and fungal diseases

53
00:15:14,886 --> 00:15:25,884
After soaking for 30 minutes, plant it.

54
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:43,880
Using pine bark and dry pumice stone to plant will help absorb moisture in the roots, making the orchid roots not rot.

55
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:49,879
Add some dry moss on the face.

56
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:54,878
Put in a cool and well-lit place for 7 days

57
00:15:54,878 --> 00:16:06,876
After 7 days, you can spray water to keep the plants moist.

58
00:16:12,874 --> 00:16:21,873
Cover with a clear, vented plastic container and wait for the plant to revive.

59
00:16:23,872 --> 00:16:30,871
AFTER 3 WEEKS,

60
00:16:30,871 --> 00:16:36,870
A sprout has sprouted,

61
00:16:38,869 --> 00:16:48,867
Spray water once every 5 days to keep the sprouts moist

62
00:16:50,900 --> 00:17:06,897
AFTER 2 MONTHS

63
00:17:16,895 --> 00:17:26,893
