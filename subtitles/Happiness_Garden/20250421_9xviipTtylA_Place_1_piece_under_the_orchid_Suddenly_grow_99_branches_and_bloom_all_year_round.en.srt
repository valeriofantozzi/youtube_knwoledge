Hello

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:07,520
everyone. Um, today I'm excited to share

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,440
a new method for making organic

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,240
fertilizer that will help you care for

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,240
your orchids at home.

00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,640
started. Now, let's learn together how

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,160
to care for orchid pots after the

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,160
flowers bloom and lose their petals.

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,440
Um, this is a very important period for

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,160
the plant to recover and prepare for the

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,160
next flowering

16
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,760
period. Throw away the old pot because

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,439
this orchid pot is only suitable for

18
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,439
growing in industrial orchid gardens.

not miss any orchid care

22
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,040
tips. Removing old stems allows the

23
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:29,240
plant to to focus its energy on

24
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,240
producing new stems and flowers.

[Music]

26
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,520
Old and yellow leaves not only reduce

27
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:44,400
photosynthesis efficiency but also

28
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,400
consume the plant's

29
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,799
energy. Pruning helps the plant conserve

30
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,799
energy for healthier

31
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,200

32
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,200

33
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,200
it?

34
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,720
Damaged roots often harbor mold and

35
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:20,400
bacteria. Removing these roots helps

36
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,040
reduce the risk of disease spreading to

37
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,040
the entire plant.

38
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,200
My maid, how do you like

39
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,800
it? The roots of this orchid are still

40
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,800
very

41
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,640
healthy. After replanting these branch

42
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,640
roots, they will grow very quickly.

43
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,120
plant orchids in new pots to help them

44
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,120
grow

45
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,560
faster. So, I planted with shredded pine

46
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,560
bark, which helps retain moisture well

47
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,200
and is also easy to drain so the roots

48
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,200
don't get water logged.

49
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:32,560

65
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,639
this orchid.

66
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,120
To make this compost, I use

67
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,199
bread. You can also take stale bread and

68
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,199
make it, which is great,

69
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,840
too. You can also take stale bread and

70

71
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,680
Put the bread in the jar.

72
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,360
Add 350 ml warm water.

73
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,600
Next, I took a

74
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,840
banana. Then cut into thin slices.

75
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,759
Put bananas in the bottle.

76
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,759
Seal the bottle and leave it in a cool

77
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,120
place to wait for 3 weeks to create GE

78
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,120
fertilizer, which is very good for

79
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,120
orchids.

80
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,240
This is the GE bottle I made with

81
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,240
bananas and bread 3 weeks

82
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,919

83
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,160
mix with 2 L of water.

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,080
liquid fertilizer.

87
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,959
Bananas are rich in potassium, vitamins,

88
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,959
and minerals which enhance the plant's

89
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,160
health. Bread offers carbohydrates

90
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,160
serving as an energy source for the

91
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,160
plant.

92
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,839
The potassium in bananas helps promote

93
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,279
strong and persistent blooming,

94
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,279

97
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:35,080
water for about 20 minutes so that the

98
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,080

solution and gently wipe the top and

103
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,560
bottom of the leaves.

104
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,080
Cleaning the leaves helps remove dust,

105
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,320
debris, and residues, allowing the plant

106
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,279
to absorb light better, which enhances

107
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,279
the photosynthesis

108
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,600
process. The GE solution provides

109
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,360
essential nutrients, keeping the leaves

110
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,640

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,040
favorable conditions for the development

114
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,040
of new leaves.

115
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,880
Clean and healthy leaves help the plant

124
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,680
Spraying GE helps the plant accumulate

energy in preparation for the next

126
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,320

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,079
water and nutrients more effectively.

132
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:49,600
After soaking for 20 minutes, take the

133
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,519
orchid pot out and place it in a place

134
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,200
with lots of scattered light for the

135
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,200
orchid to photosynthesize and

136

the roots grow very

142
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:30,040

143
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,040
base of the orchid.

144
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,360
New roots improve the plant's ability to

145
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,880
absorb water efficiently, especially

146
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,800
during the recovery phase after

147
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,600

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,120
Pour in 500 ml of water at room

202
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:24,360
temperature. Mix the rice well and wash

203
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,360
the rice before cooking.

205
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:40,440

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,480
you are watching the video from. It's

209
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,290
great that we can chat together from all

210
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,160

212
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:57,799
world. Use a cotton ball soaked in water

213
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,799
to wash this rice.

214
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:11,180
Then wipe on the top and bottom of the

215

[Music]

216
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,960
leaves will help clean the surface of

217
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,600
the leaves, remove disease fungi and

218
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,360
insects on orchids. At the same time, it

219
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,840
provides the necessary nutrients for the

220
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,840
orchid's growth.

222
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:48,759
[Music]

223
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,520
Repeat after 2 weeks will help the

224
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,520
orchid stay green.

225
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:10,450
[Music]

226
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,860
or you can also pour the rice water into

227
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:24,500
a spray bottle.

228
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:24,500
[Music]

229
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,280
Then spray evenly on the top and bottom

230
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,280
of the

231
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,969
[Music]

232
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:45,760
leaves. This method also has the same

233
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,070
effect as the previous method using

234
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:54,009
cotton balls.

235
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:54,009
[Music]

236
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,480
Do not spray rice water on

[Music]

238
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,159
flowers. Now take a deep bowl in which

239
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,720
you will place the orchid ready for

240
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,720
watering and soaking.

241
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:26,320
[Music]

242
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,320
Rice water is a great natural fertilizer

243
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,340
for orchids as it encourages the

244
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:38,120
flowering of this beautiful

245
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:40,480
[Music]

246
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,400
plant. You can soak the orchid in this

247
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,240
rice water for about 1 hour so that the

248
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,240
orchid roots can absorb the most

249
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,240
nutrients.

250
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:53,249
[Music]

251
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,720
Then remove and repeat this treatment

252
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,720
every 14 days.

253
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:17,440
[Music]

254
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,600
You can also freeze rice water to water

255
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,600
your orchids.

256
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,819
[Music]

257
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,600
When needed, you just need to take a few

258
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,600
cubes.

259
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:56,230
[Music]

260
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,130
Wait for them to defrost and reach room

261
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:19,480
temperature. You can feed your orchids

262
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:21,760
[Music]

263
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,120
again. Never place frozen blocks

264
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:27,330
directly on the base of the orchid

265
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:38,499
because orchids don't like the cold.

266
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:38,499
[Music]

267
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:44,039
After only 2 to 3 weeks of use, the

268
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,039
leaves will be green.

269
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:49,510
[Music]

270
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:57,200
[Music]

271
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,559
Um, you can see that after fertilizing

272
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,240
the new roots grow very strongly. This

273
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:05,039
will help the orchid best absorb

274
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,039
nutrients through its

275
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:12,279

276
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:17,200

Thank you for always accompanying me.

281

With enough nutrition, your orchid will

282
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:35,240
flower all year
