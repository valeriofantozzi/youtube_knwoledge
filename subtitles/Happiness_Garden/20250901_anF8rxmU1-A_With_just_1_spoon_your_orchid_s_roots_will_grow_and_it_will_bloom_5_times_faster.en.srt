Hello everyone. I am very happy to

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,440
welcome you to my channel.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,280
Today I will share how to help orchid

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,290
plants recover quickly when they face

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,480
rot.

[Music]

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,880
With just simple ingredients available

8
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,800
in every family's kitchen, we can easily

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,039
revive and help orchid plants affected

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,640
by rot to grow back quickly.

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,960
And then the flowers will bloom

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,679
brilliantly again, continuing to shine

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,880
in your beautiful garden.

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,559
Let's get started.

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,879
For orchid plants that have rotted like

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,559
this, don't rush to throw them away.

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,239
You can notice that in this spot, there

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,220
are always many harmful molds and

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,600
bacteria.

20
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,840
[Music]

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,920
When signs of rot appear, it spreads

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,920
quickly, and if not treated in time, the

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,920
orchid can be seriously damaged or even

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,920
die.

25
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:08,000
[Music]

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,530
We need to completely remove the damaged

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,960
leaves.

28
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,799
[Music]

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,880
Uh this helps prevent the spread of

30
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,720
disease uh while also allowing the

31
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,680
orchid to focus on recovering and

32
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,680
developing healthier parts.

33
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,000
Because the orchid is very weak, we need

34
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,920
to cut off the flower stems to reduce

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,159
the burden, helping the plant

36
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,560
concentrate nutrients and energy on

37
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,560
faster recovery.

38
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,159

[Music]

43
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,920
Uh you can see mold on the growing

44
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,160
medium has started to develop which

45
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,160
creates a high risk of root rot for the

46
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,160
orchid.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,520
Since the orchid has been planted in

48
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,920
this pot with the growing medium for a

49
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,480
long time, we need to completely remove

50
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,480
the old medium and replace it with a new

51
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,480
pot.

[Music]

53
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,480
Then proceed to cut off all the damaged

54
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,480
roots.

55
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,840
This helps prevent the growth of fungi

56
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,560
and creates conditions for healthy new

57
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,170
roots to develop, contributing to the

58
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:14,259
orchid's recovery process.

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,319
Um, when you see this leaf has naturally

61
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,020
dried, we don't need to cut it off, but

62
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,680
should leave it as it is.

[Music]

64
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,799
Next, we need to wash thoroughly to

65
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,799
completely remove dirt and harmful

66
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,799

76
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:45,360
I use natural lemon water

[Music]

78
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,080
I dilute lemon water with one liter of

79
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,800
water to create a mild solution that is

80
00:04:50,080 --> 00:05:05,830
safe for the orchid.

84
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,880
Then soak the orchid's roots in the

85
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,280
diluted lemon water solution for about

86
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,510
20 minutes to gently disinfect and

87
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,959
stimulate new root growth.

[Music]

89
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,919
Lemon water contains citric acid and

90
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,240
natural antibacterial agents which help

91
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,639
clean orchid roots, prevent bacteria and

92
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,600
mold, and stimulate healthy new root

93
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:10,170
growth.

00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:10,170
[Music]

95
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,280
The leftover lemon water can be further

96
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,919
diluted with water at a 1:1 ratio to

97
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,919
create a light watering solution, which

98
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,759
both disinfects the growing medium and

99
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,600
supports the recovery process, safely

100
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,759

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,759

on other healthy orchids in the garden,

106
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,110
helping to prevent fungal diseases and

107
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:57,440
boost the plant's resistance.

110
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,560
to spray on small orchids, mature

111
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,880
orchids as well as orchids that are

112
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,440

115
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,919
For orchids that are blooming, this

116
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,720
fertilizer helps keep the flowers fresh

117
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,960
longer on the stem because it provides

118
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,280
essential nutrients while also enhancing

119
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,360
the plant's health, helping the flowers

120
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,570
maintain color and freshness for a

121
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:36,620
longer time.

[Music]

123
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,160
Uh besides spraying the upper surface of

124
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,479
the leaves, you also need to pay

125
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,960
attention to spraying thoroughly on the

126
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,639
underside of the leaves as this area is

127
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,039
often damp, creating favorable

128
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,919
conditions for fungi and harmful insects

129
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,919
to gather and develop.

130
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,759
And you should avoid spraying directly

131
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,000
on the flowers because when the flowers

132
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,319
get wet, the petals will quickly wilt

133
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,319
and fade.

135
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,800
After soaking in the solution for about

136
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,720
20 minutes, take the orchid out and

137
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,319
gently blot with a soft cloth to wipe

138
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,070
off the water droplets on the roots and

139
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:56,720
stem.

[Music]

141
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,200
Then use melted candle wax to drip onto

142
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,120
the cuts. This helps prevent water from

143
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,760
seeping in, protects the wounds from

144
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,000
infection, and prevents rot on the

145
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:33,659
orchid.

146
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:33,659
[Music]

147
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,360
Next, plant the orchid into a new pot

148
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,200
with drainage holes at the bottom to

149
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,959
ensure the plant does not become water

150
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,959

151
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,959
healthier.

152
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,399
After that, I choose to use dry pine

153
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,560
bark as the growing medium for planting

154
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,560
the orchid.

155
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,800
After planting with dry pine bark, we

156
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,200
should not water immediately. This will

157
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,360
allow the bark to absorb the remaining

158
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,180
moisture from the roots, keep the roots

159
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:24,079
dry, and reduce the risk of rot.

[Music]

161
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,480
After planting, place the orchid pot in

162
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,079
a cool, wellventilated area for about 3

163
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,079
days and do not water.

164
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,240
This helps the plant adjust to the new

165
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,959
environment, allows the cuts to dry

166
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,200
completely, and gives the roots time to

167
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:45,399
adapt, thereby reducing the risk of

168
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,399
fungal infection and rot.

169
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,920
After 3 days, once the orchid adjusts,

170
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,680
start light watering or use diluted

171
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,490
liquid fertilizer to support recovery

172
00:10:53,680 --> 00:11:00,820

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,240
Before

183
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,200
applying the liquid fertilizer, spread a

184
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:48,200
thin layer of moss on the orchid pot

185
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,200

186
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,320
This helps retain moisture in the

187
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,959
growing medium while creating an ideal

188
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,200
environment for the fertilizer to absorb

189
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:02,920
evenly and the orchid to absorb

190
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,920
nutrients more effectively.

191
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,839
Then water the orchid with rice water

192
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,920
two to three times a month. This is a

193

time you spray natural fertilizer on the

385
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,760
orchids.

386
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,320
Then you hang the orchid pot in a place

387
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,320
with gentle sunlight.

389
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,870
The most suitable temperature for

390
00:25:46,400 --> 00:26:09,279
orchids is from 20 to 30°.

392
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,960
You should spray natural fertilizer on

393
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,310
the orchids about two to three times a

394
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:38,320
month as I've shared on the channel.

5 months later,

397
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,080
as you can see, with this simple method

398
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,710
from a small orchid, it has now grown

399
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:57,630
healthy and full of vitality.

What do you think about my

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,279
semihydroponic orchid growing method?

Um, have you tried applying any method

407
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,039
from the video on the channel yet? Don't

408
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,039

After 6 months, from a small orchid

414
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,080
planted in a semihydroponic pot, the

415
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,960
plant has now matured and bloomed

416
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,009
brilliantly.

growing orchids without having to worry

422
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,080
about watering, fertilizing, or daily

423
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,080

With this semi-hydroponic growing

426
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
technique, orchids maintain their fresh

427
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,720
color longer and can stay on the stem

428
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,000
for more than 6 months before the petals

429
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,919
start to wilt.
