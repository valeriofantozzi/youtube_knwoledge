00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:29,895
Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:30,894 --> 00:00:40,892
You see that this orchid has rotted and only has 1 leaf left.

3
00:00:44,892 --> 00:00:54,890
The tree is very weak, the leaves are even damaged by worms.

4
00:00:59,209 --> 00:01:09,887
The roots have been damaged by rot.

5
00:01:21,884 --> 00:01:31,882
Therefore, it is necessary to remove all rotten stains.

6
00:01:39,204 --> 00:01:48,879
Then rinse with water.

7
00:01:55,261 --> 00:02:02,876
Dry wipe.

8
00:02:25,872 --> 00:02:33,870
Then take 1 teaspoon of green tea.

9
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:52,900
Pour in 1 liter of boiled water.

10
00:02:56,066 --> 00:03:01,898
Wait until the water cools.

11
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:18,894
Then take 3 spoons of rice.

12
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:31,892
Pour in 1 liter of water at room temperature.

13
00:03:31,892 --> 00:03:39,890
and soak for 1 hour so that the flower nutrients are completely dissolved in the water.

14
00:03:47,091 --> 00:03:51,888
1 Hour Later.

15
00:03:51,888 --> 00:04:01,886
Filter out residue.

16
00:04:10,908 --> 00:04:18,883
Clean the orchid branches with green tea.

17
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:29,770
Helps eliminate pests and diseases of orchids.

18
00:04:45,337 --> 00:04:52,876
Take dry moss and put it in a jar.

19
00:04:54,875 --> 00:05:03,874
Pour in green tea and steep for 30 minutes.

20
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:50,898
Soaking orchid branches for 30 minutes helps the plant quickly germinate and take root

21
00:06:19,892 --> 00:06:29,890
Then take the moss out and press it tightly into the basket.

22
00:06:47,642 --> 00:06:52,885
Pour water into the jar.

23
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:05,883
Control the water level in this position so that the moss always maintains appropriate humidity.

24
00:07:08,882 --> 00:07:18,880
Then create a hole and plant the orchid in.

25
00:07:46,408 --> 00:07:56,873
From now on, spray this rice water on the orchid branches once a week.

26
00:07:59,872 --> 00:08:09,870
Cover with a transparent glass jar.

27
00:08:11,044 --> 00:08:21,868
Place on the windowsill or under a sun filter for orchids.

28
00:08:30,355 --> 00:08:33,899
3 Weeks Later.

29
00:09:03,387 --> 00:09:12,891
The orchid has taken root.

30
00:09:44,056 --> 00:09:54,883
The roots are very strong so the tree will revive very quickly.

31
00:10:06,597 --> 00:10:16,878
Now I plant and do not cover, but let the orchids grow in the outside environment.

32
00:10:16,878 --> 00:10:26,876
