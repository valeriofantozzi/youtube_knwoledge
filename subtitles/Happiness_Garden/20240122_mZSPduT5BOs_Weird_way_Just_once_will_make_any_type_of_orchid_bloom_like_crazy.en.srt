No.1

6
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:50,890
To make this fertilizer you need apples.

7
00:00:56,889 --> 00:01:06,887
Apples contain potassium, an important mineral for orchid growth.

8
00:01:12,886 --> 00:01:22,884
Potassium helps orchids develop stronger leaves, roots and flowers.

9
00:01:29,883 --> 00:01:36,881
I took the apple peel and put it in a bottle.

10
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:50,879
Soak in boiled water and leave overnight.

11
00:02:06,982 --> 00:02:08,875
No. 2

12
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:20,873
To make this type of fertilizer you need more eggshells.

13
00:02:41,868 --> 00:02:51,900
Soak the eggshells in boiled water and leave overnight.

14
00:03:28,892 --> 00:03:38,890
After 1 night, filter the water.

15
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:29,880
So we have fertilizer from apples and eggshells.

16
00:04:32,026 --> 00:04:36,012
FIRST METHOD.

17
00:04:39,878 --> 00:04:48,877
Water this fertilizer solution on the orchid roots.

18
00:04:54,875 --> 00:05:04,873
Eggshells provide natural calcium which is very good for orchids.

19
00:05:04,873 --> 00:05:14,871
Helps orchids stay healthy and increase resistance.

20
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:36,867
Apple peels contain a lot of Phosphorus, which is also an important nutrient for orchid growth.

21
00:05:41,455 --> 00:05:53,486
especially during the flowering and flower development stage.

22
00:06:00,983 --> 00:06:10,960
Do this 1-2 times/month to supplement nutrition and increase the orchid's resistance.

23
00:06:25,891 --> 00:06:29,890
SECOND METHOD.

24
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:46,753
Spray this fertilizer on the entire orchid.

25
00:06:52,952 --> 00:06:59,951
This method is similar to using foliar fertilizer.

26
00:07:06,883 --> 00:07:16,947
Calcium in eggshells helps orchids stay healthy and increases their resistance to pests.

27
00:07:23,746 --> 00:07:32,744
Apples contain nitrogen, an important nutrient.

28
00:07:33,877 --> 00:07:42,875
Helps orchids develop green parts and increase photosynthesis ability.

29
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:06,871
Do not spray on flowers.

30
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:15,869
Because wet flowers will easily fall off.

31
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:20,868
THIRD METHOD

32
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:35,898
Clean the leaf surface with this liquid fertilizer.

33
00:08:40,897 --> 00:08:48,896
The leaf surface will always be clean and airy.

34
00:08:55,894 --> 00:09:03,959
Orchids will photosynthesize better.

35
00:09:08,892 --> 00:09:18,890
Fertilizing regularly 1-2 times/month will help keep the leaves healthy.

36
00:09:20,414 --> 00:09:24,389
No. 3

37
00:09:26,888 --> 00:09:36,886
You can reuse eggshells and apple peels to make fertilizer again.

38
00:10:07,363 --> 00:10:10,346
RESULT.

39
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:22,944
This type of fertilizer stimulates rooting very quickly.

40
00:10:29,742 --> 00:10:39,740
After 1 month of use you will see great results.

41
00:10:44,873 --> 00:10:56,870
Many flower buds develop and do not fall.

42
00:11:10,868 --> 00:11:20,899
Blooming flowers stay on the branches for a long time before fading.

43
00:11:26,898 --> 00:11:36,896
Flowers can remain on branches for up to 6 months before falling.

44
00:11:48,893 --> 00:11:58,891
