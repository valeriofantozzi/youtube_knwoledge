I will share so you can propagate from any Orchid

[Music]

60
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,320
I use recycled plastic boxes 
to make miniature green houses  

61
00:11:37,320 --> 00:12:03,000
to help propagate orchids [Music] 
faster there's a vent here [Music]

62

[Music]

63
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:16,680
place the Orchid in a miniature greenhouse

74
00:14:38,640 --> 00:15:04,420

78
00:16:02,672 --> 00:16:06,960
[Music]  

79
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,080
when the orchid has just 
lost all its flowers it is  

80
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:14,920
the best time to propagate from the flower [Music]

81
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:20,120
stem buttons that have bloomed cannot be

82
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:42,580
propagated so so I cut off the 
nodes that have finished [Music]

83
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:58,840
blooming uh repair the cut to 
avoid crushing the flower stem

84
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,120
[Music]  

85
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,440
sprinkle cinnamon powder on the cut 
to help it heal quickly and prevent

86
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:58,840
rot leave for one day for 
the cut to dry completely

87
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,200
[Music]

88
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,640
one day

89
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:19,480
later peel off the protective 
film on the flower [Music]

90
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:58,720

[Music]

93
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:10,500
now I use tomatoes to revive 
young orchids from flower [Music]

94
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:20,280
stems Tomatoes contain many important 
nutrients such as nitrogen n phosphorus
