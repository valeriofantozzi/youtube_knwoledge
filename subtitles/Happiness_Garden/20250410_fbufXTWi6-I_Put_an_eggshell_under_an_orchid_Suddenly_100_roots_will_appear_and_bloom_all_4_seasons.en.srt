3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,800
care for weak orchids, helping them

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,679
recover strongly from roots to leaves

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,679

00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:18,960

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,960
tips. You can see that this orchid

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,359
hasn't grown for 6 months. Its leaves

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,279
are gradually wilting. The roots are

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,279
rotting and the plant is on the brink of

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,200
dying. Have you ever encountered a

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,559
similar situation and didn't know what

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,559
to do to save your beloved

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,399
orchid? Uh, first I'll carefully remove

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,239
all the wilted and damaged leaves. This

17
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,480
is important because unhealthy leaves

18
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,520
can drain the plant's energy, hindering

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,520
its recovery and

20
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,280
growth. Next, I'll cut off all the

21
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,520
damaged roots. This is essential because

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,280
rotten roots can spread decay to healthy

23
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,970
parts of the plant, preventing it from

24
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:36,599
from absorbing nutrients properly.

26
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,000
Uh, finally, I'll cut off any old flower

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,920
stems if present. This helps the plant

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,680
focus its energy on new growth rather

29
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,790
than wasting resources on fading

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,919

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,600
let the rice water ferment overnight to

The result after the next 3

193
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,320

194
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:08,160
almost fully recovered with the leaves

195
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,160

196
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:27,360

197
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,360
new flower spike that's very healthy.

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,800
With this simple care routine, the

00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,799

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,799
excellent source of nutrients for

241
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,799
orchids.

242
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,640
When recycled into fertilizer, potato

243
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:08,480
peels provide essential vitamins and

244
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,480
minerals that help the plants grow

245
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,559

easier. Cut the potato skin into small

252
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,600

Next, I need eggshells.

00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,760

263
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,679

264
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:41,880

the plant in better nutrient absorption.

298
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:41,120

00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,279

[Music]

384
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:23,360
rays. Orchids need about 12 to 14 hours

385
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:26,399
of light daily. You can use LED lights

386
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,399
if natural light is

387
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:36,000
insufficient. If the leaves turn yellow

388
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:36,000
or light green, the plant may be lacking

389
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,919
light. Conversely, if the leaves are

390
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,919
sunburned, reduce direct sunlight

391
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,919
exposure.

392
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,399
Sometimes you may need to relocate the

393
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,960
plant to ensure it receives adequate

394
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,960
light without

395
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:02,559
damage. Using organic fertilizers helps

396
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,799
the plant absorb light and nutrients

00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,799

Welcome to my

406
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:01,159

00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:03,679
B1?

00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,170
Mix in four cups of room temperature

[Music]

421
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,640
eggshells. Eggshells contain many

422
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,640
nutrients needed by plants including

423
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,640
calcium, potassium, and trace elements

424
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,530
such as iron, magnesium, manganese,

425
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:26,569
copper, and zinc.

[Music]

427
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,599
Therefore, eggshells will help provide

428
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,599
necessary nutrients for

429
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,119
orchids. Dry on low heat for 5

430
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:51,480
minutes. This helps to eliminate fungal

431
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,480
diseases before using as fertilizer.

433
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:08,000
When using eggshells as fertilizer, it

434
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,020
also helps to increase the pH of the

435
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:23,839

[Music]

437
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:29,119
In addition, I also use 100 g of organic

438
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,680
fertilizer from livestock waste pressed

439
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,680

441
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,720
Then mix the two types together.

450
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,790

451
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:34,599

This fertilizer also helps flowers bloom

458
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,520
for a long

459
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:59,119

00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:03,119
2 months, it is guaranteed that the

461
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,119
orchid will bloom for 6 months without

462
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:14,880
wilting. With orchids with buds, I also

463
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:18,160
apply this fertilizer to help flower

464
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,160

and prevent parasitic insects on

474
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:31,200

00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,200
the supply of nutrients through orchid

00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,520
protecting plants from external agents

487
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:20,040
such as drought, sunburn, and cold, and

488
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:20,040

490
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:31,130
You should fertilize B1 for orchids once
