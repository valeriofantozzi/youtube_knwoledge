00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,896
Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:38,893
When your orchid leaves turn yellow and wilt.

3
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:55,889
You need to check the roots for damage.

4
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:08,887
If the roots are damaged, all damaged roots must be cut off.

5
00:01:10,187 --> 00:01:19,885
This will prevent the rotten roots from spreading and causing the orchid stem to rot.

6
00:01:27,783 --> 00:01:36,881
and cut off yellow and rotten leaves.

7
00:01:36,881 --> 00:01:46,879
This helps keep the rot from spreading into the tree trunk

8
00:01:50,102 --> 00:02:00,877
Then rinse under running water to remove dirt.

9
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:15,874
Place the leaves in a jar to prevent further wilting.

10
00:02:15,874 --> 00:02:22,872
Wait for the roots to dry completely before planting

11
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:34,870
Put 2 liters of water into the pot.

12
00:02:42,168 --> 00:02:56,899
I took 5-6 eggs and boiled them.

13
00:03:01,997 --> 00:03:09,896
Boil over low heat for 10 minutes.

14
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:26,893
After 10 minutes take the eggs out.

15
00:03:32,892 --> 00:03:42,890
Pour the water you just boiled the eggs into the jar.

16
00:03:50,538 --> 00:04:00,886
Then take 3 tablespoons of rice and soak it in the water you just boiled the eggs in.

17
00:04:05,914 --> 00:04:15,883
Incubate until the water cools.

18
00:04:26,548 --> 00:04:38,879
After the water cools, filter to remove sediment.

19
00:04:54,542 --> 00:04:58,875
Step 1.

20
00:05:08,624 --> 00:05:16,871
Wipe the leaves thoroughly with this water.

21
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:30,868
This water helps eliminate fungal diseases and harmful insects.

22
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:43,899
and also helps restore leaves very well.

23
00:05:54,621 --> 00:06:03,895
then soak the orchid roots in this water for about 30 minutes.

24
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:20,892
This helps stimulate rooting very quickly.

25
00:06:23,891 --> 00:06:34,889
After 30 minutes, take it out and plant it in a vase.

26
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:43,887
Pour in water.

27
00:06:45,534 --> 00:06:55,744
Water level control only reaches this position.

28
00:06:58,884 --> 00:07:08,882
Place in a cool, well-lit place and regularly change the water when it is dirty.

29
00:07:09,382 --> 00:07:16,881
Spray water periodically every 3-5 days.

30
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:26,879
Continue soaking orchid roots in rice water once a week.

31
00:07:30,356 --> 00:07:33,877
1 MONTH LATER.

32
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:42,875
My orchid has grown a lot of new roots.

33
00:07:45,642 --> 00:07:53,873
This helps orchids quickly recover withered leaves.

34
00:08:08,097 --> 00:08:18,868
Now I plant the orchid in a pot so it can grow in the same environment as other normal orchids.

35
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:30,899
Once the root system is strong, planting the orchid in a pot will help the orchid grow and recover quickly.

36
00:08:34,032 --> 00:08:41,897
Water regularly to keep moist.

37
00:08:51,729 --> 00:09:01,893
Then take care of it with homemade organic fertilizer that I have shared on this channel.

38
00:09:05,154 --> 00:09:08,892
After the next 2 months.

39
00:09:11,771 --> 00:09:21,889
The orchid has completely recovered, its leaves are normal and sturdy.

40
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:56,882
A healthy root system helps absorb nutrients well, so the plant recovers very quickly.

41
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:11,879
and it develops many buds (flower stems) at the same time.

42
00:10:12,313 --> 00:10:20,878
