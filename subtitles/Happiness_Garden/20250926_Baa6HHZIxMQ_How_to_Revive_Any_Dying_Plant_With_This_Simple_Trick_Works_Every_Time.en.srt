00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,480
ornamental plant that has rotted like

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,320
now, I will guide you step by step on

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,640
how to treat and save the plant, helping

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,119
it recover to full health so you can

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:35,559
still enjoy lush greenery and vibrant

13
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,559
vitality in your living space.

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,680
First, we need to cut off all damaged or

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,600
rotting leaves so that the plant can

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,000
focus its energy on recovering the

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,000
remaining parts.

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,520
You can see that all the leaves are

19
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,079
damaged with no green leaves left for

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,760
the plant to photosynthesize.

21
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,079
This may seem worrying, but don't worry

22
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,640
because with proper care, the plant

23
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,600
still has a chance to revive and grow

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,479
again.

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,479
Next, we check the roots.

27
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,400
You can see that the roots are infected

28
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,720
with mold with a soft surface and

29
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,200
discoloration which prevents the plant

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,840
from absorbing nutrients. Early

31
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,680
detection will help us treat it in time,

32
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,479
protect the healthy roots, and give the

33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,479
plant a chance to recover.

34
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,520
We need to remove all the old growing

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,159
medium as it may contain mold and

36
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,000
bacteria harmful to the roots. This

37
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,720
helps clean the environment around the

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,720
roots, creating favorable conditions for

53
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,200

At the same time, lemon is gentle and

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,760
does not harm the healthy roots,

prepare the new growing medium.

102
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,120
The first ingredient is coconut husk

103
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,520
chips used for planting. 50% coconut

104
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,759
husk helps retain moisture, provides

105
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,680
irerration for the roots, and creates an

106
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,400
ideal environment for the plant to grow

107
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,120
healthily.

108
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,840
The next ingredient is sand or organic

109
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,759
soil, making up about 50% of the

110
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,520
planting mixture. This component helps

111
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,120
the plant drain well while also

112
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,280
providing essential nutrients for the

113
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,850
roots and leaves, creating balanced

Then mix all the ingredients thoroughly.

117
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,600
This ensures a uniform growing medium

118
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,479
retaining moisture while providing

119
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,320
irerration creating an ideal environment

120
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,320
for the roots to grow strong and

121
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,320
healthy.

122
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,680
You can check the growing medium by

123
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,919
squeezing it in your hand. If it gently

124
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,000
crumbles when released, it is a sign

125
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,319
that it has the right irration and

126
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,560
moisture retention. This will help the

127
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,840
roots grow naturally without water

129
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,160
After soaking for 20 minutes, we take

130
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,759
the antherum out and plant it in a new

131
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,759

132
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,080
This allows the roots to be in a clean,

nutrient-rich environment, providing the

134
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,960

135
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,960

are spread out evenly and not bent or

140
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,199

141
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,880
naturally, absorb nutrients better, and

142
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,280

sides of the pot so the growing medium

147
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,319
settles evenly around the roots. This

148
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,360
helps the plant stand more firmly,

149
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,280
ensures good rootto soil contact, and

150
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,479

nutrients evenly, providing just enough

healthy, creating a foundation for the

192
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,080
next growth season.

193
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,200
After watering, place the plant in a

194
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,200
spot with gentle sunlight. Soft light

195
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,279
allows the plant to photosynthesize just

196
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,480
enough, stimulating root and new chute

197
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,480
growth without shocking the plant.

198
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,920
Uh, and here is the result after 3 weeks

199
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,360
of recovery.

200
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,600
You can see that the plant has started

201
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,800
to grow new shoots from the mother stem,

202
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,200
signaling strong vitality and a

203
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,200
successful recovery. These new shoots

204
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,240
will develop into healthy leaves and

205
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,320
flowers in the coming time.

206
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,760
This shows that with proper care, the

207
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,160
plant can recover strongly from the

208
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,160
damaged parts.

209
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:04,000
I continue to fertilize the plant with

210
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:07,040
natural fertilizer.

211
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,519
Um, I choose rice to make fertilizer for

212
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,760
the next stage. Rice provides natural

213
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,680
sugars and some essential nutrients,

214
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,200
helping the roots grow strong, promoting

215
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,640
quick sprouting of new shoots, and

216
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,640
maintaining the plant's long-lasting

217
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,640
vitality.

218
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,440
Just two teaspoons of rice are enough.

219
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,440
This amount provides gentle nutrients,

220
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,360
allowing the plant to absorb effectively

221
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,040
without overloading while stimulating

222
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:36,480
healthy growth of roots and new shoots.

223
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,079
Add 500 ml of water to the rice.

224
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,920
Diluting helps the nutrients from the

225
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,320
rice distribute evenly, making them

226
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,160
easier to absorb, supporting healthy

227
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,920
growth of roots and new shoots, while

228
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,920
maintaining the plant's long-asting

229
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,920
vitality.

[Music]

231
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,720
Uh after mixing, you can pour the

232
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,720
solution into a spray bottle. This helps

233
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,200
evenly apply the nutrients to the roots,

234
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:10,200
stem, and new shoots, ensuring the plant

235
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,200
absorbs effectively and grows healthily.

236
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,279
Then spray evenly onto the new shoots

237
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,519
and growing medium. This helps the

238
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,680
nutrients penetrate deeply, stimulates

239
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,279
rapid growth of new shoots while

240
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,279
nourishing the roots and creating

241
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,220
favorable conditions for the plant to

242
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,519
recover strongly.

244
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,760
uh then spray evenly over the new shoots

245
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,160
and growing medium. This helps the

246
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,839
nutrients penetrate deeply, stimulates

247
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,440
rapid growth of new shoots while

248
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,120
nourishing the roots and creating

249
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,519
favorable conditions for the plant to

250
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,519
recover strongly.

251
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,839
Do this twice a month, alternating with

252
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,839
regular watering.

253
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,880
Remember

254
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,560
to place the plant in a spot with gentle

255
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,440
sunlight. Soft light allows the plant to

256
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,760
photosynthesize just enough, stimulating

257
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,600
root and new chute growth without

258
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,600
burning the leaves or shocking the

259
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,600
plant.

recovery.

263
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,200
You can see the shoots growing stronger,

264
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,800
leaves lush and green, and roots robust,

265
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,240

will clearly see vitality radiating from

271
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:52,240
every leaf, root, and new sprout.

272
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,079
This shows that with patience and proper

273
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,320
care, the plant can fully recover and

274
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:59,990

fertilize the plant, it is an act of
