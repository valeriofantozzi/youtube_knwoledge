00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,840
effective ways to help orchids stay

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,680
The growth journey of an orchid begins

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,520
with healthy roots, spreads through lush

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,480
green leaves, and culminates in the

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,400
vibrant beauty of blooming flowers full

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,119
If cared for properly, the plant will

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,800
thrive from its roots and foliage and

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,250

When you care for the roots and tend the

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,000
Has your orchid ever had yellowing

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,080
leaves? This is a sign that many orchid

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,080
growers often encounter, but don't worry

30
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,159
too much.

31
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,200
Yellow leaves can be the plant's way of

32
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,799
reacting to its environment or a gentle

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,040
reminder that it needs a little

34
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,240
adjustment in care. Let's explore the

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,240
causes and how to fix them.

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,560
This orchid leaf, as you can see, has

37
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,040
turned yellow. But unlike a case of

38
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,119
overwatering, the leaf is dry and has

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,960
lost its plumpness.

40
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,799
This is a sign that the plant is lacking

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,840
water or the roots are having trouble

42
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,439
absorbing moisture.

43
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,960
Observe carefully to find the right

44
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,460
solution before the condition becomes

45
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,880
more serious.

yellow, it is still fresh and firm.

49
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,600
When you cut it off, you will notice

50
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,399
that the leaf is quite tough and clings

51
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,399
tightly to the stem.

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,119
Um, this is a sign of the natural aging

54
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,800
process and is not a major concern. On

55
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,800
the other hand, if the orchid is over

56
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,800
watered, just a light touch can cause

57
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,760
the leaf to fall off easily due to the

58
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:23,880
base being mushy and rotten.

After removing the yellow leaves, the

62
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,640
next step is to eliminate the withered

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,640
and damaged roots.

64
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,760
These root parts can no longer absorb

65
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,720
water and nutrients, and if left, they

66
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,319
may affect the plant's growth. Cleaning

67
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,000
the roots helps the plant become

68
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,860
healthier and ready for the recovery

will see that it is still fresh and not

74

75
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,200
cause does not come from the substrate.

76
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,360
The orchid may have developed yellow

77
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,159
leaves due to a sudden change in

78
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,760
environment or prolonged lack of water,

79
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,239
which caused the roots to be unable to

80
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,239
support the leaves.

81
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,239
Uh, I added a bit of moss to the surface

82
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,140
of the pot to retain moisture and create

83
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,920
a cooler environment for the roots.

89
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,479
before fertilizing the orchid, you need

90
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,400
to water it to moisten the roots first.

it in a cool, airy spot to drain.

Each time you water and soak like this,

110
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,199
it also helps cleanse the growing

This type of molasses is rich in

When watering the banana fertilizer and

195
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,480
molasses mixture at the base, the orchid

196
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,880

215
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,839

216
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,000

stems, and the entire orchid plant.

223
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,360
When spraying this mixture over the

224
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,440
entire plant, the natural nutrients from

225
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:59,120
bananas and molasses will absorb through

226
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,040
the epidermis of the leaves and stems.

227
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,880
As a result, the plant is not only

228
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,959
nourished through the roots, but also

229
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,880
absorbs additional nutrients directly

230
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:10,340
from the outside, helping it recover

231
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,079

steps about one to two times a month.

235
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,959
This frequency is just right to provide

236
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,959
nutrients, help the plant recover from

237
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:27,399
stress, and maintain the orchid's

238
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,399

239
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,440
Step four. After spraying, use a dry

leaf surface quickly return to a dry,

251
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,000
airy state, allowing the leaves to

breathe better.

253
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,920
This is especially beneficial for the

254
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,519
photosynthesis process, helping the

After soaking for about 20 minutes,

258
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:20,639
gently take the orchid pot out and place

259
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,720
it in a spot with gentle sunlight.

First, I will remove all the yellow

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:13,120
leaves that have been infected by fungus

326
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,880
to prevent the disease from spreading

flower spikes along with the rotting

331
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,199

332
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,439

To begin the recovery process for the

348
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,840
onion, a familiar kitchen ingredient,

349
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,240

358
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,280

00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,039
Then, place the orchid into this mixture

363
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,960

387
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,679
I make an extra drainage hole at a fixed

388
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,840
position so that when growing the orchid

389
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,760
in a semi-hydroponic style, the water

390
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,080
level in the pot stays stable and

391
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,559
doesn't rise too high, which could lead

392
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,559
to root rot.

393
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,840
Then I continue to make several small

394
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,480
holes around the sides of the bottle to

395
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,640
ensure the roots stay well ventilated,

396
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:52,520
reduce water stagnation, and help the

397
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,520
plant grow more healthily.

403
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,880
I use crushed pine bark to grow orchids.

404
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,280
It's an ideal growing medium because it

405
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,280
retains moisture well, drains quickly,

406
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,720

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,720

excess onion water to avoid water

427
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:41,600

both the top and underside of the

483
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,919

When the stamata on the leaf surface are

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,200
absorbs nutrients better and the leaves

492
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,200
