00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,880
Hello everyone. Today I will continue

00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:07,960
sharing how to care for

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,840
orchids. After the orchid has finished

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,559
blooming, what should we do to help it

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,559
grow and bloom

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,080
continuously? In this video, I will

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,920
guide you step by step to ensure your

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,920
orchids stay healthy and bloom

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:33,120
regularly. Let's get started.

12
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:35,200
[Music]

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,160
This is the orchid I bought at the

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,160
industrial orchid

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,980
garden. One month after I bought it, all

16
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,230
the flowers fell

17
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,230
[Music]

18
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,199
off. To care for it to continue

19
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,760
flowering, I first need to cut off the

20
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:09,920
old flower stems.

21
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:11,680
[Music]

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,889
Then I sprinkle coffee over the

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,889
[Music]

24
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,360
cut. Coffee contains some compounds with

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,390
antibacterial and antifungal properties

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:28,880
helping to prevent infection at the cut.

27
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:30,560
[Music]

28
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,560
This is crucial because cuts on the

29
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,079
plant can provide an opportunity for

30
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,079
bacteria and fungi to

31
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,079
enter. Then cut off damaged roots.

32
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:50,960
[Music]

33
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,520
Uh, cutting off damaged roots helps the

34
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:57,520
orchid recover quickly, stops the spread

35
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,520
of disease, and saves energy for the

36

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,159

38
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,159
to dry completely.

39
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:18,619
[Music]

40
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,360
To make fertilizer to take care of this

41
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:29,839
orchid, I need potatoes.

42
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,839
[Music]

43
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,800

[Music]

45
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,599
Take about 30 g of potatoes and cut them

46
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,599
into small pieces.

47
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,000
Potatoes contain nutrients like

48
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,440
potassium, phosphorus, and vitamin C,

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,440
which help promote the growth of

50
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,440
orchids.

51
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,640
Compounds in potatoes help improve the

52
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,959
development of the root system, allowing

53
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,120
orchids to absorb water and nutrients

54
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,120

56
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:53,879
effectively. And then put the chopped

57
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,879
potatoes into the jar.

58
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,360
And to make this fertilizer, I need one

59
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,489
more aloe vera leaf.

60
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,489
[Music]

61
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,919
Aloe vera when used as fertilizer for

62
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,000
orchids provides vitamins, minerals, and

63
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:27,720
natural enzymes stimulating the growth

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,720
of roots and leaves.

65
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,000
Put in

[Music]

67
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:49,520

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,800

69
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,009
[Music]

70
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:09,199

71
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,520
Stir well so that the nutrients dissolve

72
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,520
into the

73
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:25,000
water. Then filter out the residue.

74
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,360
Step

75
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:54,520
one, water your orchid with this liquid

76
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,520
fertilizer solution.

77
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,280
Aloe vera provides vitamins and natural

78
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,280
enzymes, while potatoes add minerals

79
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,080
like potassium and phosphorus, helping

80
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,080
the orchid grow

81
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,240
robustly. This combination helps

82
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,560
encourage the orchid to bloom regularly

83
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,240
and for a longer period, thanks to the

84
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,240
nutrients that support the blooming

85
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,240
process.

86
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,360
After watering, soak the orchid pot in

87
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,360
this water for about 20

88
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,580

[Music]

91
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:51,000
two, you choose this water into a spray

92
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
bottle.

93
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,560
Aloe vera and potatoes provide vitamins,

94
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,720
minerals, and enzymes, helping the

95
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,520
orchid absorb nutrients quickly through

96
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,520
its leaves and

98
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:18,520

99
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,520
and bottom of the leaves.

100
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,400
When sprayed on the leaves, liquid

101
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,720
fertilizer helps orchids absorb

102
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,759
nutrients more easily and enhances the

103
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,759
development of the root system.

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,360
leaves to help keep them cleaner.

108
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,560
Um, wiping the leaves helps remove dust,

109
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,879
debris, and bacteria from the leaf

110
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,879

111
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,879
breathe better and absorb light more

112
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,879
effectively.

113
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,599
Wiping the leaves helps enhance

114
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,440
photosynthesis because clean leaves

115
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,080
absorb light better and can convert

116
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,080
energy more

[Music]

118
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:53,610
efficiently. Wiping the leaves with

119
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:57,279
water helps reduce the risk of mold.

um and bacterial diseases because a

122
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,120
clean leaf surface limits the

123
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,120
environment for harmful pathogens to

124
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,120
grow.

128
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,160
four, spray the entire orchid again with

129
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,160
this water to help wash away dirt and

130
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,160

create a favorable environment for mold

137
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:05,290

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:14,950
the risk of infection.

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,280
helps the stamata stay open and function

148
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,920
Keeping the leaves dry prevents the

orchid from staying wet for too long,

150
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,839
helping to avoid diseases related to

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,839
excessive moisture and enhancing its

153
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:06,480
minutes, take it out and place the

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,480
orchid pot in a place with plenty of

healthier. As a growing medium, I use

174
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,959
crushed pine bark to help the roots stay
