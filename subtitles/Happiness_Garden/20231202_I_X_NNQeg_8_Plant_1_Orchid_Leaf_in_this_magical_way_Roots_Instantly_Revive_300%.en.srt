00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
Hello everyone, today I share how to recover.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:10,898
Orchids only have one leaf left, the plant will develop a healthy root system.

3
00:00:12,898 --> 00:00:18,897
with a very simple method.

4
00:00:22,896 --> 00:00:30,894
If an orchid has yellow leaves.

5
00:00:32,894 --> 00:00:38,893
The tree has rotted.

6
00:01:01,888 --> 00:01:12,886
Cut off all damaged roots.

7
00:01:28,883 --> 00:01:36,881
The entire tree's roots are damaged and rotten.

8
00:01:36,881 --> 00:01:46,879
But the leaf above is still very good, don't throw it away.

9
00:01:55,905 --> 00:02:05,876
Rinse with water.

10
00:02:51,900 --> 00:03:00,898
Then you use 1 clove of garlic.

11
00:03:29,892 --> 00:03:39,890
Then puree with 500ml of water.

12
00:03:50,888 --> 00:03:58,887
Filter out residue.

13
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:13,884
You will wipe to disinfect the leaves
.

14
00:04:15,578 --> 00:04:23,882
This method will help orchids
recover faster,

15
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:37,879
The leaves will not be susceptible to fungus and rot during the recovery process.

16
00:04:46,306 --> 00:04:56,875
Then you soak the base of the plant for 20 minutes, this will help new roots grow very quickly.

17
00:05:11,872 --> 00:05:21,870
With the excess garlic water, I water the other orchids in the morning.

18
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:38,900
this will help new roots grow very quickly.

19
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:48,898
20 Minutes Later.

20
00:05:49,898 --> 00:05:57,896
Wait 1 day for the cut to dry.

21
00:06:02,206 --> 00:06:06,894
1 Day Later.

22
00:06:10,894 --> 00:06:19,892
Pour water into the box.

23
00:06:58,884 --> 00:07:08,882
Then you plant the orchid branches in this box

24
00:07:10,882 --> 00:07:18,880
Note: The water level only reaches the orchid stem.

25
00:07:19,912 --> 00:07:24,879
Place in a cool, well-lit place.

26
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:34,877
Spray moisturizer every 3-5 days and change the water once.

27
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:46,875
Place in miniature greenhouse.

28
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,873
1 Month Later.

29
00:08:18,868 --> 00:08:28,900
 
As a result, after 1 month the roots began to grow very healthy.

30
00:08:33,199 --> 00:08:43,897
With this simple method, the roots will grow very quickly
and healthy.

31
00:08:48,915 --> 00:08:58,894
With this simple method, we can easily restore healthy roots to orchids.

32
00:09:08,892 --> 00:09:18,890
Now you can completely rest assured to replant the tree.

33
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:32,887
Helps plants grow better in the outside environment.
