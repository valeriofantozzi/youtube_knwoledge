Hello everyone, to easily care for orchids to always grow healthily.

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:15,897
There are more flower buds and flowers stay on the branches longer.

3
00:00:15,897 --> 00:00:23,896
Today I share a very easy way to keep orchids growing healthy.

4
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:33,027
This is soybeans

5
00:00:33,637 --> 00:00:40,626
I used 1 tablespoon of soybeans

6
00:00:40,992 --> 00:00:47,991
Soybeans contain many nutrients, especially organic nitrogen and potassium.

7
00:00:49,624 --> 00:00:55,623
And this is the yeast, I took 1 spoon of yeast

8
00:00:57,823 --> 00:01:03,888
Add 1 tablespoon brown sugar

9
00:01:13,408 --> 00:01:20,385
And finally, you need bread. When eating leftover bread, don't rush to throw it away

10
00:01:22,384 --> 00:01:30,882
Bread provides a carbon source for microorganisms in the orchid growing environment such as fungi and beneficial bacteria,

11
00:01:32,882 --> 00:01:39,881
Helps increase organic decomposition in soil and improve orchid growth

12
00:01:49,773 --> 00:01:53,878
Add 500ml of water

13
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:09,708
Remember to leave space so that the jar does not explode when fermenting.

14
00:02:55,796 --> 00:03:02,793
Leave in a cool place for 3 weeks before using

15
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:16,461
3 weeks later

16
00:03:17,314 --> 00:03:23,293
Take 5 liters of water

17
00:03:37,973 --> 00:03:44,956
Then take 50ml of this fertilizer solution made from soybeans and bread

18
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:16,883
Method one: Water the roots with this liquid fertilizer

19
00:04:22,787 --> 00:04:30,786
Doing this every 2 weeks helps stimulate leaf and flower growth very well

20
00:04:43,621 --> 00:04:51,600
This fertilizer provides nitrogen and potassium, an important mineral that improves plant health and vitality.

21
00:05:08,672 --> 00:05:17,072
This type of fertilizer also helps retain water and enhances the plant's ability to absorb water.

22
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:57,363
The beneficial fungus Mycorrhiza will grow to help the plant more easily absorb nutrients from the orchid growing medium.

23
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,627
Method 2.

24
00:06:22,636 --> 00:06:30,623
Use this water to spray on the leaves.

25
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:43,954
Helps supplement nutrients through leaves very effectively.

26
00:06:47,152 --> 00:06:53,118
Helps orchid leaves become strong and healthy.

27
00:06:55,218 --> 00:07:02,217
You should do it early in the morning and by noon the leaves will dry very quickly.

28
00:07:02,217 --> 00:07:07,010
Do this once a week to keep the orchid healthy.

29
00:07:08,923 --> 00:07:11,881
Method 3:

30
00:07:15,521 --> 00:07:20,513
Now I wash the leaves with this water.

31
00:07:21,513 --> 00:07:28,511
Beneficial microorganisms will help kill mold and insects very effectively.

32
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:37,510
Do this every 2 weeks to protect your orchids.

33
00:08:05,642 --> 00:08:07,642
Result

34
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:16,069
After fertilizing, the orchid will always be green and healthy.

35
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:30,299
Nitrogen and Potassium in soybeans and bread help flower buds grow strongly.

36
00:08:35,465 --> 00:08:40,464
The leaves are always green and hard

37
00:08:40,464 --> 00:08:48,566
Helps orchids increase their resistance to pests.

38
00:08:53,975 --> 00:09:00,960
The potassium in this fertilizer helps spread more buds

39
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:30,521
When the flowers bloom, they will stay on the branches for a long time.

40
00:09:34,028 --> 00:09:42,018
Flowers can last on branches for up to 6 months before fading.

41
00:09:42,018 --> 00:09:50,783
Hopefully the video will help you a lot in taking better care of orchids at home.

42
00:09:50,783 --> 00:09:59,881
