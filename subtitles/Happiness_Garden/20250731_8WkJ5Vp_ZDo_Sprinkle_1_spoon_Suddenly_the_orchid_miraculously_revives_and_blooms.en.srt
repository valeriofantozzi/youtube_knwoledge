Hello everyone. Today I will share with

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:07,440
you a simple yet effective way to help

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,280
your orchid quickly recover.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,960
If your orchid is wilting, weakened

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,599
after blooming, or suffering from

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,440
improper care, don't worry. With just a

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,920
few gentle steps, it will soon thrive

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,920
again as before.

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,240
If you have orchids with yellowing or

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,960
starting to rot leaves, don't be quick

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,039
to throw them away. Uh, take some time

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,199
to watch this video carefully and follow

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,510
each step. You'll be surprised by the

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,680

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,320
Rotten leaves often contain a lot of

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,640
harmful fungi and bacteria. Therefore,

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,960
the first thing you need to do is

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,200
immediately isolate the rotting orchid

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,800
from the healthy ones to prevent the

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,200
disease from spreading to your entire

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,200
orchid garden.

24
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,559
You can see a snail hiding in the orchid

25
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,480
pot. Those small bite marks left by the

26
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,119
snail could be the reason why the orchid

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,960
is damaged and infected with fungus.

28
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,840
These wounds create favorable conditions

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,080
for bacteria and fungi to easily enter

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,080

32
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,360
Next, we need to carefully inspect the

33
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,680
root system. Healthy orchid roots are

34
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,560
usually ivory white or fresh green,

35
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,119
plump, and have good elasticity. If you

36
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,360
see roots that are darkened, mushy, or

37
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,040
have an unusual smell, that's a sign

38
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,799
they are damaged and need to be removed

39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,730
immediately to prevent the rot from

40
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,079
spreading to the healthy roots.

42
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,479
This root system is almost completely

43
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,960
damaged. Most of the roots have become

44
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,680
rotten, discolored, and can no longer

45
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,520
absorb water or nourish the plant. If

46
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,360
not treated in time, the plant will

47
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,980
continue to deteriorate and be very

48
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,230
difficult to recover.

Gently cut off all the damaged and

52
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,360
rotten roots. Keep only the fresh, firm,

53
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,120
and light colored roots. These are the

54
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,760
ones still capable of recovering and

55
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,760
sustaining the orchid.

56
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,760
Um, removing the damaged roots is a very

57
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,440
important step as it helps eliminate the

58
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,040
source of disease and creates the

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,440
conditions for the plant to begin

60
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,000
regenerating. Use clean, sharp scissors

61
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,840
to neatly trim each rotten root,

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,040
avoiding injury to the healthy base of

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,480
The baby orchid, though still small, has

193
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,279
developed strong roots and firm, vibrant

194
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,959

195
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,760
recovering very well and is ready to

196
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,760

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:39,279
revived this little orchid? Don't

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,880
hearing your feedback and experiences.

Now, let's explore the roots inside the

growing medium to see how they are

205
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,000
developing. This will be an important

206
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,200
part to help you understand the health

207
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:14,210

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,000
Wow. You can see the new pure white

210
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,240
roots hidden inside the growing medium.

211
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,240
This is a wonderful sign that the orchid

212
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,310
is recovering and growing stronger every

213
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:32,720

[Music]

215
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,320
These new roots will help the orchid

216
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,720
absorb water and nutrients more

217
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,399
efficiently, thereby boosting its

218
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,959
vitality and promoting the overall

219
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,959
growth of the plant.

220
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,279
The roots are often compared to the

221
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,360
heart of the orchid. Therefore, when the

222
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,519
root system is healthy, the plant will

223
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,839
have enough vitality to grow lush green

224
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:01,000

227
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,720
Now, I need to choose a larger pot to

228
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,800
plant the orchid. Selecting the right

229
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,720
pot will give the roots room to grow,

230
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,600
helping the orchids stay healthy and

231
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,800
bloom better.

232
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,800
And I choose shredded pine bark as the

233
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,600
growing medium because it helps protect

234
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,760
the orchid roots, retains moisture well,

235
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,839
and provides good erration, creating

236
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,850
favorable conditions for strong root

237
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:55,700
development.

239
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,040
Gently place the orchid into the new

240
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,600
pot. Then fill in the shredded pine bark

241
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,199
around the roots. Make sure the roots

242
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,760
are secured but still have enough

243
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:11,560
airflow so the plant stays stable and

244
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,560
continues to grow well.

245
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Gently tap the sides of the pot to help

246
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:27,279
the pine bark settle evenly around the

247
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,360
roots and make the plant more stable.

248
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,680
This also helps eliminate large air gaps

249
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,560
in the growing medium, creating a stable

250
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,560
environment for root development.

252
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,040
And finally, spread a bit of moss on the

253
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,959
surface of the pot. This layer of moss

254
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,120
will help lightly retain moisture on the

255
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,120
surface of the growing medium while also

256
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,960
creating a more natural and cooler

257
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:53,229

260
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,279
After planting, we will prepare a

261
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,600
natural fertilizer to care for the

262
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,440
orchid. The nutrients from the

263
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,680
fertilizer will help the roots quickly

264
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,519
adapt to the new environment and

265
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,519
encourage the plant to grow more

267
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,920
Rice is always the ingredient I

268
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,240
prioritize for making fertilizer because

269
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,800
it is rich in natural nutrients,

270
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,639
especially starch and vitamin B, which

271
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:34,680
are excellent for the development of

272
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,680
orchid roots and leaves.

273
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,639
Take one spoonful of rice and pour it

274
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:45,440
into 500 ml of clean water. Then stir

275
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,120
well. Let it sit for about 30 minutes so

276
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,360
the nutrients in the rice can infuse

277
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,860
into the water, creating a natural tonic

278
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:59,040
for the orchid.

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,680
water from the top and use it to water

282
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,360

287
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,480
You can use this fertilizer twice a

288
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,000

289
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,759

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Rotating them will help the orchid

also soak the orchid pot in the solution

296
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,600
for about 20 minutes. This method helps

place it in a bright, airy spot with
