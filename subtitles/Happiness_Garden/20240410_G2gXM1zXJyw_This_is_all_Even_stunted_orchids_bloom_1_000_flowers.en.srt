00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:06,732 --> 00:00:16,897
These are orchids that have finished blooming. The tree becomes stunted.

3
00:00:17,764 --> 00:00:25,762
If you want it to continue to grow and bloom, do as I do.

4
00:00:27,471 --> 00:00:33,894
Cut off all dry and rotten branches.

5
00:00:41,681 --> 00:00:51,657
This flower branch was still fresh but had fully bloomed so it was cut off.

6
00:00:55,729 --> 00:01:04,888
Same with this branch.

7
00:01:16,357 --> 00:01:26,883
This helps the orchid concentrate nutrients on the nodes so it can continue to bloom.

8
00:01:33,882 --> 00:01:43,880
Then use toothpaste to apply to the cut.

9
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:53,217
This helps the cut heal quickly.

10
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:12,874
Next, use eggshells that are rich in calcium, potassium and organic phosphorus.

11
00:02:12,874 --> 00:02:22,898
Very good for root development, flower buds and increasing pest resistance for orchids.

12
00:02:35,532 --> 00:02:45,501
Then dry at low temperature for 10 minutes, helping to eliminate fungal diseases that harm orchids.

13
00:02:57,247 --> 00:03:06,230
After 10 minutes, take it out and wait for the eggshell to cool.

14
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:45,023
then grind into powder.

15
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:10,284
Take 2 spoons of eggshell powder.

16
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:35,179
Add 1 liter of boiled water.

17
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:49,070
then brew until the water cools.

18
00:04:50,058 --> 00:04:59,041
2 hours later, decant the clear water above.

19
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:28,869
Add 4 liters of water to get 5 liters of eggshell liquid fertilizer solution.

20
00:05:32,112 --> 00:05:36,101
Step 1

21
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:49,765
Use this water to thoroughly wipe the top and bottom of the leaves.

22
00:05:52,572 --> 00:06:02,562
Helps clean dirt and eliminate fungi, bacteria, and insects that are harmful to orchid leaves.

23
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:13,535
Helps leaves photosynthesize better and increase disease resistance.

24
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:18,892
Step 2

25
00:06:19,956 --> 00:06:29,890
Water this liquid fertilizer for orchids 1-2 times a month.

26
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:44,287
Egg shells contain many important minerals such as calcium, potassium and magnesium,

27
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:52,286
along with other nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.

28
00:06:52,286 --> 00:07:00,284
These substances are necessary for the growth and health of orchids.

29
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:17,880
Adding fertilizer from eggshells helps stimulate the growth of orchids, helping them grow strong and healthy.

30
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:31,044
Step 3

31
00:07:39,308 --> 00:07:46,275
Spray this liquid fertilizer on the orchid 1-2 times a month.

32
00:07:50,457 --> 00:08:00,872
Minerals and nutrients from eggshells help orchids prevent attacks from harmful bacteria, fungi and insects.

33
00:08:00,872 --> 00:08:10,884
This type of fertilizer stimulates flower development very well.

34
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:18,102
Result

35
00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:29,100
After 2 months of fertilization, the orchid finished blooming and continued its growth cycle and grew many new flower buds.

36
00:08:42,387 --> 00:08:52,362
From the cut nodes, many new flower branches grow.

37
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:06,892
Newly bloomed flowers are very healthy.

38
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:43,385
