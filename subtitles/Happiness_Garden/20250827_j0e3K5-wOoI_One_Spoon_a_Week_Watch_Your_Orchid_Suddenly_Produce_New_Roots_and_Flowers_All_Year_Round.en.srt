When growing orchids, if you notice the

roots growing strongly, but the pot is

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,719
too small, this is a sign that the plant

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,719
needs more space to grow fully and

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,719

Repot immediately so the plant has more

space to grow well. The roots are well

Uh before planting the orchid in a new
