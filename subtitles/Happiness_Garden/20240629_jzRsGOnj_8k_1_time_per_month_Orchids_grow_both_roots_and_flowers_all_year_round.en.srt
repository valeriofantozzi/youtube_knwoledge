Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:16,897
In this video, I share the method of recovering weak orchids.

3
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:28,895
Helps them quickly take root and grow strongly.

4
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:42,892
I picked up a rotten orchid that someone had thrown away.

5
00:01:06,887 --> 00:01:16,885
All the roots have rotted.

6
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:56,877
This original part has completely rotted so it can no longer be used.

7
00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:11,874
Wash orchid branches with water.

8
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:28,871
Then take 1 clove of garlic and mince it.

9
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:24,893
Add 500ml of water and soak for 30 minutes.

10
00:03:24,893 --> 00:03:31,892
Let the flower nutrition completely dissolve in water.

11
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,890
AFTER 30 MINUTES.

12
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:58,887
Wiping orchid branches with garlic water helps disinfect and eliminate fungal diseases.

13
00:04:22,882 --> 00:04:32,880
Then soak the orchid branches in garlic water for 10 minutes.

14
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:43,903
This helps stimulate root and shoot growth.

15
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,875
10 Minutes Later.

16
00:05:12,872 --> 00:05:22,870
because this orchid has many scars from previous insect bites.

17
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:31,868
So I waited a day for the orchid to dry completely before planting it.

18
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,899
1 Day Later.

19
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:53,897
I recycle sponges as orchid nursery tools.

20
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:36,889
Soaking the sponge in garlic water for 20 minutes helps disinfect and kill fungus.

21
00:06:46,887 --> 00:06:50,886
20 MINUTES LATER.

22
00:07:06,883 --> 00:07:16,881
Insert the orchid stem into the sponge and place it in the vase.

23
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:30,878
Pour some water into the jar and change it every time it gets dirty.

24
00:07:32,878 --> 00:07:40,876
Spray moisturizer every 3 days.

25
00:07:40,876 --> 00:07:50,874
and Place in a cool, well-lit place.

26
00:07:55,873 --> 00:07:59,872
5 WEEKS LATER

27
00:08:03,872 --> 00:08:10,870
The roots have grown very healthy.

28
00:08:17,869 --> 00:08:27,900
With this simple method, the roots have grown and the orchid has revived very well.

29
00:08:59,894 --> 00:09:09,892
I planted it in a pot so the orchid could grow better.

30
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:26,889

In this video, I share how to take care of orchids to help them grow and flower

35
00:10:10,013 --> 00:10:13,879
You see my orchids.

36
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:24,877
New flowers always grow after the old ones fall

37
00:10:25,877 --> 00:10:33,875
so my orchids bloom all year round.

38
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:39,874
bloom from branch to branch.

39
00:10:41,873 --> 00:10:46,873
flowers bloom on long branches

40
00:10:52,871 --> 00:10:59,870
Flowers can be kept on branches for up to 6 months

41
00:11:05,869 --> 00:11:10,868
Many flowers grow on the same tree

42
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:28,898
New roots grow a lot to help absorb nutrients best

43
00:11:32,897 --> 00:11:37,896
chubby flower buds

44
00:11:47,894 --> 00:11:52,893
Help flowers bloom long on branches

45
00:12:01,891 --> 00:12:06,890
brilliant flowers

46
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:12,889
How to make fertilizer as follows:

47
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:16,888
Use 1 small carrot weighing about 30g

48
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,420
Cut into small pieces

49
00:12:41,883 --> 00:12:45,882
Add 1 liter of filtered water

50
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,880
Puree

51
00:13:08,878 --> 00:13:12,877
filter out residue

52
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:45,870
Add 1 liter of filtered water

53
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,870
How to use

54
00:13:50,869 --> 00:13:55,868
Use a cotton ball to soak up carrot juice

55
00:13:57,868 --> 00:14:02,867
Wipe both the top and bottom of the leaves

56
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:13,898
help get rid of insects

57
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:17,897
and open stomata

58
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:29,895
Orchid will have better photosynthesis and metabolism

59
00:14:33,894 --> 00:14:40,893
At the same time, orchids also absorb some nutrients through the leaves

60
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:07,888
Help keep the leaves green

61
00:15:41,881 --> 00:15:45,880
2nd way

62
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:52,879
Water this carrot for orchids

63
00:15:53,878 --> 00:15:58,877
Carrot juice is a good source of nutrients for orchids,

64
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:06,876
including vitamins and minerals like beta-carotene, potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus.

65
00:16:07,876 --> 00:16:11,875
When the carrot juice is poured into the orchid pot,

66
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:15,874
it provides nutrients to the orchids and helps to promote their health.

67
00:16:17,874 --> 00:16:23,872
In addition, carrot juice is also acidic, which helps regulate the pH of the potted soil

68
00:16:23,872 --> 00:16:28,871
and enhances the orchid's ability to absorb nutrients.

69
00:16:30,871 --> 00:16:38,870
You can soak the orchid pot in this carrot juice for 20 minute

70
00:16:39,869 --> 00:16:44,868
Do this 1-2 times a month

71
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:54,900
3rd way

72
00:17:06,897 --> 00:17:11,896
mist moisturizing carrot juice for orchids

73
00:17:16,895 --> 00:17:21,894
Spray both the top and bottom of the leaves

74
00:17:22,894 --> 00:17:27,893
help wash away dirt, wash away insects on orchids

75
00:17:27,893 --> 00:17:33,892
Nutrients in carrot juice help orchids thrive and bloom

76
00:17:33,892 --> 00:17:38,891
However, be careful not to over-water the carrot juice as it can clog the water lines in the orchid.

77
00:17:39,891 --> 00:17:44,890
Do not water the flowers because the flowers fall off quickly

78
00:17:47,889 --> 00:17:52,888

Subscribe to the video so you don't miss any tips on my channel.

84
00:18:38,879 --> 00:18:42,878
No.1

85
00:18:42,878 --> 00:18:50,877
To make this fertilizer you need apples.

86
00:18:56,876 --> 00:19:06,874
Apples contain potassium, an important mineral for orchid growth.

87
00:19:12,872 --> 00:19:22,870
Potassium helps orchids develop stronger leaves, roots and flowers.

88
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:36,868
I took the apple peel and put it in a bottle.

89
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:50,898
Soak in boiled water and leave overnight.

90
00:20:06,895 --> 00:20:08,895
No. 2

91
00:20:10,894 --> 00:20:20,892
To make this type of fertilizer you need more eggshells.

92
00:20:41,888 --> 00:20:51,886
Soak the eggshells in boiled water and leave overnight.

93
00:21:07,883 --> 00:21:12,882
Leave overnight

94
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:38,877
After 1 night, filter the water.

95
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:29,900
So we have fertilizer from apples and eggshells.

96
00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:35,899
FIRST METHOD.

97
00:22:39,898 --> 00:22:48,896
Water this fertilizer solution on the orchid roots.

98
00:22:55,895 --> 00:23:05,893
Eggshells provide natural calcium which is very good for orchids.

99
00:23:05,893 --> 00:23:16,891
Helps orchids stay healthy and increase resistance.

100
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:36,887
Apple peels contain a lot of Phosphorus, which is also an important nutrient for orchid growth.

101
00:23:41,886 --> 00:23:53,883
especially during the flowering and flower development stage.

102
00:24:00,882 --> 00:24:10,880
Do this 1-2 times/month to supplement nutrition and increase the orchid's resistance.

103
00:24:25,877 --> 00:24:29,876
SECOND METHOD.

104
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:46,873
Spray this fertilizer on the entire orchid.

105
00:24:52,872 --> 00:24:59,870
This method is similar to using foliar fertilizer.

106
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:16,867
Calcium in eggshells helps orchids stay healthy and increases their resistance to pests.

107
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:32,897
Apples contain nitrogen, an important nutrient.

108
00:25:33,897 --> 00:25:42,895
Helps orchids develop green parts and increase photosynthesis ability.

109
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:06,890
Do not spray on flowers.

110
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:15,889
Because wet flowers will easily fall off.

111
00:26:16,888 --> 00:26:20,888
THIRD METHOD

112
00:26:25,887 --> 00:26:35,885
Clean the leaf surface with this liquid fertilizer.

113
00:26:40,884 --> 00:26:48,882
The leaf surface will always be clean and airy.

114
00:26:55,881 --> 00:27:03,879
Orchids will photosynthesize better.

115
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:18,876
Fertilizing regularly 1-2 times/month will help keep the leaves healthy.

116
00:27:20,876 --> 00:27:24,875
No. 3

117
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:36,873
You can reuse eggshells and apple peels to make fertilizer again.

118
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,899
RESULT.

119
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:22,897
This type of fertilizer stimulates rooting very quickly.

120
00:28:29,895 --> 00:28:39,894
After 1 month of use you will see great results.

121
00:28:44,893 --> 00:28:56,890
Many flower buds develop and do not fall.

122
00:29:10,887 --> 00:29:20,885
Blooming flowers stay on the branches for a long time before fading.

123
00:29:26,884 --> 00:29:36,882
Flowers can remain on branches for up to 6 months before falling.

124
00:29:51,879 --> 00:30:03,877
4/4

125
00:30:06,276 --> 00:30:15,274
if you have orchids after blooming.

126
00:30:16,186 --> 00:30:26,172
If all the flowers have fallen, don't rush to throw them away.

127
00:30:26,172 --> 00:30:36,670
Let me tell you how to help these branches continue to bloom strongly again.

128
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:46,868
These nodes can continue to bloom very well.

129
00:31:11,938 --> 00:31:19,928
When you eat bananas.

130
00:31:20,928 --> 00:31:28,926
Don't throw away the peel.

131
00:31:34,925 --> 00:31:44,923
Thinly sliced ​​banana peels contain many vitamins and minerals that are very good for the bud formation process.

132
00:32:08,918 --> 00:32:18,916
Soak banana peels in 1 liter of boiled water.

133
00:32:27,915 --> 00:32:35,913
Then take 3 tablespoons of coffee grounds.

134
00:32:48,911 --> 00:32:58,909
Then soak this coffee grounds in 1 liter of boiled water.

135
00:33:04,907 --> 00:33:12,906
Then wait for the water to cool.

136
00:33:20,871 --> 00:33:30,869
After the water cools, filter to remove sediment.

137
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:50,898
Dip a cotton ball in water extracted from coffee grounds and wash the leaves.

138
00:33:54,897 --> 00:34:04,895
Helps eliminate pests and diseases of orchids.

139
00:34:11,894 --> 00:34:20,892
and leaves will photosynthesize better.

140
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:46,887
Mix these two types together.

141
00:34:54,886 --> 00:35:04,884
Dip cotton balls in this water and clip them to nodes that are likely to continue blooming.

142
00:35:10,882 --> 00:35:20,880
Do it once a week.

143
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:40,876
will help stimulate rapid sprout growth.

144
00:36:00,873 --> 00:36:10,871
Keep the cotton pad on the branch like that for 20 minutes and then remove it.

145
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:24,868
then water the roots once a week.

146
00:36:34,899 --> 00:36:44,897
Soak it for 10 minutes then lift it out.

147
00:36:59,894 --> 00:37:09,892
And spray this water once a week to help supplement nutrients through the leaves.

148
00:37:26,889 --> 00:37:34,887
After 20 minutes, remove the cotton pad.

149
00:37:56,883 --> 00:38:06,881
Then place the plant in a place with lots of light so it can bloom easily.

150
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,879
1 MONTH LATER.

151
00:38:19,878 --> 00:38:29,876
Many buds have grown.

152
00:39:14,867 --> 00:39:24,899
Continue watering and spraying the orchid with this water once a week.

153
00:39:45,895 --> 00:39:53,893
Then place the plant in a place with lots of light so it can bloom easily.

154
00:39:56,892 --> 00:40:00,892
After the next 1 month.

155
00:40:05,891 --> 00:40:15,889
From the dry branches, many beautiful flowers have sprouted and bloomed.

156
00:40:19,888 --> 00:40:29,886
The leaves are strong and sturdy, very resistant to pests and diseases.

157
00:40:40,884 --> 00:40:50,882
The flower color is also more vibrant than usual.

158
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:06,879

Hello friends.

163
00:42:08,533 --> 00:42:15,898
You see here a withered orchid.

164
00:42:15,898 --> 00:42:22,897
Maybe it's because you didn't water it.

165
00:42:22,897 --> 00:42:31,895
or due to direct sunlight shining on the orchid.

166
00:42:31,895 --> 00:42:40,893
If you want orchids to be nourished and grow quickly.

167
00:42:40,893 --> 00:42:47,892
Please watch this video carefully.

168
00:42:47,892 --> 00:42:55,890
Now I will share this amazing trick with you.

169
00:42:55,890 --> 00:43:05,888
You need 1 aloe vera leaf.

170
00:43:14,887 --> 00:43:28,884
This aloe vera gel is great for reviving orchids.

171
00:43:28,884 --> 00:43:43,881
Now apply aloe vera gel on the top and bottom of the leaf.

172
00:43:43,881 --> 00:43:54,879
Aloe vera gel has a very good moisturizing effect.

173
00:43:54,879 --> 00:44:06,876
In addition, aloe vera also contains vitamins A, B, and C

174
00:44:06,876 --> 00:44:18,874
and minerals such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.

175
00:44:18,874 --> 00:44:30,871
Do this every 5 days and leave the orchid pot in a cool place for 3 weeks.

176
00:44:30,871 --> 00:44:43,869
Next, take 1 liter of warm water and put it in the bottle.

177
00:44:43,869 --> 00:45:00,899
Then take 1 spoon of rice and soak it in this water for about 30 minutes.

178
00:45:00,899 --> 00:45:11,897
Let the nutrients in the rice completely dissolve into the water.

179
00:45:11,897 --> 00:45:21,895
Chop the remaining aloe vera leaves into small pieces.

180
00:45:39,891 --> 00:45:50,889
Then puree with 300ml of water.

181
00:46:06,886 --> 00:46:18,883
Filter out residue half past four Add 2 liters of water at room temperature.

182
00:46:42,879 --> 00:46:54,876
After soaking for 30 minutes, filter this rice water.

183
00:47:06,874 --> 00:47:16,872
Mix rice water with aloe vera juice.

184
00:47:19,871 --> 00:47:29,869
So I ended up with about 3 liters of this wonderful liquid manure solution.

185
00:47:59,897 --> 00:48:09,895
Cover the pot with moss to retain moisture better.

186
00:48:22,892 --> 00:48:32,890
Now you use this solution to water the orchid every 5 days.

187
00:48:47,887 --> 00:48:57,885
Soak the orchid pot in this water for 2 hours.

188
00:49:02,884 --> 00:49:12,882
After soaking for 2 hours, remember to lift the orchid pot and place it in a cool place to let the orchid recover.

189
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,880
2 WEEKS LATER.

190
00:49:29,879 --> 00:49:36,878
Fertilize after 2 weeks for fresher orchid leaves.

191
00:49:39,877 --> 00:49:46,876
New roots develop very well.

192
00:49:50,875 --> 00:49:59,873
Many new roots are growing.

193
00:50:04,872 --> 00:50:14,870
New roots will help transport water and nutrients from the roots to the stem.

194
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:24,868
If the leaves are provided with enough water and nutrients from the roots,

195
00:50:25,868 --> 00:50:32,900
The leaves will gradually become lush again.

196
00:50:38,899 --> 00:50:42,898
1 MONTH LATER.

197
00:50:45,897 --> 00:50:55,895
You see the leaves are very fresh.

198
00:51:14,891 --> 00:51:24,889
and the orchid grows a new leaf.

199
00:51:34,888 --> 00:51:38,887
after the next 2 months

200
00:51:39,887 --> 00:51:50,884
The orchid has grown two branches (two buds).

201
00:51:52,884 --> 00:52:02,882
But the leaves at the base have turned yellow so I will cut off these yellow leaves.

202
00:52:07,881 --> 00:52:16,879
Instinctively, when an orchid buds, if the plant lacks nutrients,

203
00:52:16,879 --> 00:52:26,877
the base leaves will turn yellow and fall off to provide nutrients for the buds to develop.

204
00:52:31,876 --> 00:52:41,874
Now I need to supplement the orchid's nutrition by taking 3 spoons of rice.

205
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:56,871
Then soak in 2 liters of water at room temperature

206
00:52:58,871 --> 00:53:06,869
and wait 30 minutes for the nutrients to completely dissolve in water before using.

207
00:53:08,869 --> 00:53:12,868
30 Minutes Later

208
00:53:14,868 --> 00:53:26,899
Add 3 tablespoons of milk

209
00:53:33,897 --> 00:53:43,895
Rice water and milk are excellent sources of nutrients for orchids to grow

210
00:53:50,894 --> 00:54:00,892
Now you water the orchid with this solution once a week to help the orchid recover quickly.

211
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:22,888
After the next 1 month.

212
00:54:28,886 --> 00:54:38,884
After 3-4 times of applying liquid fertilizer from milk and rice water, the orchid had many roots.

213
00:54:39,884 --> 00:54:47,883
Hope the video will help you a lot.

214
00:55:06,879 --> 00:55:16,877
Next, I share how to make orchids bloom at the same time with many flower branches.

215
00:55:19,876 --> 00:55:29,874
Orchids after flowers fade.

216
00:55:30,874 --> 00:55:40,872
We cut off all the spent flower stems.

217
00:55:43,872 --> 00:55:52,870
If the plant has never bloomed, it must have 3 or more pairs of leaves.

218
00:55:53,870 --> 00:56:00,868
and healthy roots.

219
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:20,898
Sprinkle cinnamon powder on the wound to help it heal quickly.

220
00:56:28,896 --> 00:56:35,895
Then wait 1 day for the cut to dry.

221
00:56:47,892 --> 00:56:57,890
Then take 1/2 small onion and cut it into thin slices.

222
00:57:15,887 --> 00:57:25,885
Add 1 liter of water and bring to a boil.

223
00:57:28,884 --> 00:57:32,883
Wait a day then use.

224
00:57:41,881 --> 00:57:51,880
Next take 3 spoons of rice.

225
00:57:53,879 --> 00:58:03,877
Then soak in 1 liter of water and leave for 1 day before using.

226
00:58:20,874 --> 00:58:30,872
After a day, filter out the residue.

227
00:58:46,869 --> 00:58:56,900
Mix the two types together.

228
00:59:04,898 --> 00:59:12,897
Clean the leaves with this water.

229
00:59:15,896 --> 00:59:25,394
Helps eliminate fungi and bacteria to help orchids grow better.

230
00:59:25,394 --> 00:59:31,393
Do it once a week.

231
00:59:37,392 --> 00:59:47,390
Then use this water to water the orchid roots.

232
00:59:54,389 --> 01:00:03,387
This will help stimulate root and flower stem growth.

233
01:00:06,386 --> 01:00:12,385
Do it once a week.

234
01:00:21,383 --> 01:00:31,881
Place cotton balls between 2 leaves

235
01:00:58,876 --> 01:01:06,874
Then spray this water on the cotton pad.

236
01:01:07,874 --> 01:01:15,872
This stimulates flower stems to grow.

237
01:01:18,872 --> 01:01:28,870
and spray on the top and bottom of the leaves to help supplement nutrients through the leaves for the orchids.

238
01:01:30,869 --> 01:01:39,868
This should be done early in the morning, so that by noon the leaves will dry before the sun shines.

239
01:01:41,867 --> 01:01:51,899
After 30 minutes, remove the cotton and repeat once a week.

240
01:01:54,898 --> 01:02:03,896
and take out the orchid pot.

241
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:14,894
2 Months Later.

242
01:02:17,893 --> 01:02:25,892
Many flower stems grow at the same time.

243
01:02:41,889 --> 01:02:47,888
Orchids also grow many new roots.

244
01:02:49,887 --> 01:02:58,885
With this simple method, you can easily care for blooming orchids at home.

245
01:03:09,883 --> 01:03:19,881
If you find the video interesting, don't forget to like, share and subscribe to the channel to easily follow tips on growing orchids.

246
01:03:44,876 --> 01:03:49,875
Now I share with you a wonderful organic fertilizer,

247
01:03:50,875 --> 01:03:52,875
And anyone can do it easily.

248
01:03:53,874 --> 01:03:55,874
Just 1 to 2 ripe bananas,

249
01:03:56,874 --> 01:04:03,872
And the orchid garden will bloom all kinds of flowers.

250
01:04:04,872 --> 01:04:13,871
Now I will revive this orchid with new flowers,

251
01:04:13,871 --> 01:04:19,869
You've seen this orchid lose all its flowers, leaving only withered branches

252
01:04:24,868 --> 01:04:33,900
And here are the withered orchids that have been revived with lots of new flowers.

253
01:04:43,898 --> 01:04:47,897
STEP

254
01:04:52,896 --> 01:05:00,895
cut off the withers

255
01:05:14,892 --> 01:05:20,891
Apply toothpaste on the cut

256
01:05:32,888 --> 01:05:40,887
This will disinfect and help prevent rot

257
01:06:03,882 --> 01:06:12,880
Don't throw away banana peels when eating bananas

258
01:06:27,877 --> 01:06:32,876
Use 1 to 2 ripe banana peels

259
01:06:52,872 --> 01:07:00,871
Clip the banana peel to the place where the flower buds can grow

260
01:07:00,871 --> 01:07:08,869
and note to remove after 6 hours

261
01:07:08,869 --> 01:07:18,867
This helps to create the right moisture, provide essential nutrients and stimulate flower sprouts,

262
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:29,865
do this once a week

263
01:07:37,863 --> 01:07:39,863
STEP 2

264
01:07:39,863 --> 01:07:48,861
Use a banana peel to wipe the top and bottom of the leaves,

265
01:07:48,861 --> 01:07:55,860
Helps eliminate insects, fungi, bacteria hiding on orchid leaves,

266
01:07:55,860 --> 01:08:04,858
and at the same time provide a part of nutrients through the leaves for orchids

267
01:08:06,858 --> 01:08:16,856
Orchids will be protected and will not be affected by yellowing and rotten leaves.

268
01:08:18,855 --> 01:08:26,854
After wiping, you will see green leaves,

269
01:08:29,853 --> 01:08:36,852
Orchids will photosynthesize better to increase resistance.

270
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:43,850
 STEP 3

271
01:08:50,849 --> 01:08:55,848
1 liter of water

272
01:09:22,843 --> 01:09:29,841
Leave in a cool and dark place for 1 day

273
01:09:38,839 --> 01:09:40,839
AFTER 1 DAY

274
01:09:46,838 --> 01:09:52,837
banana juice is darker

275
01:10:21,864 --> 01:10:26,863
Use this absorbent cotton

276
01:10:29,863 --> 01:10:35,862
 Clip a cotton ball where the flower buds can grow

277
01:10:35,862 --> 01:10:41,860
and note to remove after 6 hours

278
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:50,859
This helps to create the right moisture, provide essential nutrients and stimulate flower sprouts,

279
01:10:50,859 --> 01:10:54,858
do this once a week

280
01:10:55,858 --> 01:10:58,857
STEP 4

281
01:11:00,857 --> 01:11:06,855
Normally after 3-4 weeks flower buds will be formed and develop like this,

282
01:11:06,855 --> 01:11:15,854
With a flower sprout this big, there's no need to sandwich banana peels with cotton balls

283
01:11:27,851 --> 01:11:37,849
You will be surprised how amazing this is

284
01:12:15,842 --> 01:12:25,840
Don't forget to subscribe to see my next videos

285
01:12:34,838 --> 01:12:36,838
STEP 5

286
01:12:37,837 --> 01:12:39,837
Add water to make 2 liters

287
01:12:40,837 --> 01:12:45,836
Water this banana for orchids once every 2-3 weeks

288
01:12:46,836 --> 01:12:50,835
Banana peel is rich in potassium, phosphorus and essential vitamins.

289
01:12:50,835 --> 01:12:54,834
will promote the growth of orchid roots

290
01:12:54,834 --> 01:13:01,666
In particular, the potassium in banana peels stimulates flowering very well.

291
01:13:01,666 --> 01:13:08,665
In addition, you need to combine using other organic fertilizers for orchids,

292
01:13:09,664 --> 01:13:17,663
like manure made from soybeans, peas, fish poop... as I shared,

293
01:13:17,663 --> 01:13:23,662
then make sure the orchid will grow healthy and produce many flowers

294
01:13:23,662 --> 01:13:33,660
The flowers stay on the branches for a long time before fading

295
01:13:44,657 --> 01:13:54,889
Hope this sharing content will help you in taking better care of orchids at home

296
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:12,419
To help you have many choices when caring for orchids at home with organic fertilizer.

297
01:14:14,418 --> 01:14:20,417
In this video, I continue to share new methods.

298
01:14:21,417 --> 01:14:28,415
Subscribe to the video so you don't miss any tips on my channel.

299
01:14:28,415 --> 01:14:32,415
Now, let's get started.

300
01:14:35,414 --> 01:14:46,412
To make this type of organic fertilizer you need black tea (or tea grounds).

301
01:14:50,411 --> 01:14:59,409
I use 3 teaspoons of black tea.

302
01:15:01,409 --> 01:15:11,407
Add 1 liter of boiled water.

303
01:15:21,405 --> 01:15:31,403
Incubate until the water cools.

304
01:15:38,402 --> 01:16:08,429
After the water cools, filter to remove sediment.

305
01:16:18,427 --> 01:16:28,425
Add water to make 5 liters of black tea solution.

306
01:16:41,422 --> 01:16:56,419
Next add 1 teaspoon of baking soda.

307
01:17:11,417 --> 01:17:15,416
FIRST METHOD

308
01:17:18,415 --> 01:17:28,413
Water this fertilizer solution on the orchid roots.

309
01:17:36,412 --> 01:17:46,410
Black tea contains many minerals and organic substances that help provide nutrition for orchids.

310
01:17:55,408 --> 01:18:05,406
It contains nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus,

311
01:18:06,406 --> 01:18:15,404
Important nutritional factors for orchid growth.

312
01:18:26,402 --> 01:18:36,433
Baking soda (bicarbonate soda) has the ability to increase the PH level in orchid pots,

313
01:18:40,432 --> 01:18:50,430
This is helpful in reducing acidity if you use too much chemical fertilizer.

314
01:18:59,428 --> 01:19:09,426
Baking soda has the ability to kill insects and fungi that are harmful to plants.

315
01:19:23,424 --> 01:19:26,423
SECOND METHOD

316
01:19:46,419 --> 01:19:56,417
Spray this fertilizer on the entire orchid.

317
01:20:06,415 --> 01:20:16,413
This method is similar to using foliar fertilizer.

318
01:20:23,412 --> 01:20:33,410
You can use it as a natural pesticide to protect orchids from insects and diseases.

319
01:21:01,404 --> 01:21:05,404
THIRD METHOD

320
01:21:12,402 --> 01:21:22,433
Clean the leaf surface with this fertilizer solution.

321
01:21:33,431 --> 01:21:45,429
The leaf surface will always be clean and the stomata will not be clogged.

322
01:21:55,427 --> 01:22:05,425
Orchids will photosynthesize better.

323
01:22:11,424 --> 01:22:14,423
RESULT

324
01:22:19,422 --> 01:22:33,419
Plant roots are protected and supplemented with nutrients so they grow very healthily.

325
01:22:38,418 --> 01:22:48,416
will help orchids absorb the most nutrients.

326
01:22:55,415 --> 01:23:05,413
Because they are provided with enough nutrition, the flowers bloom more brilliantly.

327
01:23:09,412 --> 01:23:19,410
Many flowers bloom on the same branch.

328
01:23:26,409 --> 01:23:37,407
The flowers stay on the branches for a long time before fading.

329
01:23:42,406 --> 01:23:51,404
Thank you for watching the video. Wishing you luck and success in life.

330
01:23:52,404 --> 01:23:59,402
Goodbye and see you again in the next videos.
