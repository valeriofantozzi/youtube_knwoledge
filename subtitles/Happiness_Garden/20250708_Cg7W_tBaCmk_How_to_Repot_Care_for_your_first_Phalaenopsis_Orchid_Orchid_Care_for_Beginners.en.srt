Welcome to the happiness garden where we

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,240
take care of our beloved orchids

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,800
together and find joy in the simplest

00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,679
Today I will share how to replace the

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,759
growing medium and repot the orchid. An

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,680
important step to help the plant recover

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,039
after a long period and grow stronger.

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,359
This creates the conditions for the

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,600
orchid to grow new roots, have lush

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,040
green leaves, and even bloom all year

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,800
round if cared for properly.

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,480
After buying an orchid, once the flowers

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,640
fade, the plant often falls into a

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,360
weakened state. The leaves begin to turn

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:43,120
yellow, the roots gradually weaken, and

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,960
the plant appears lifeless.

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,800
After buying an orchid, once the flowers

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,879
fade, the plant often falls into a

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,680
weakened state. The leaves begin to turn

22
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:55,559

the plant appears lifeless.

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,879
First, cut off the old and withered

25
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,960
flower spike. This helps the plant stop

26
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,960
wasting energy on the faded part and

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,880
instead focus its energy on restoring

28
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,600
roots and leaves and preparing for the

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,600
next blooming cycle.

Next, gently remove the soft plastic pot

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,640
that is commonly used in industrial

33
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,320
orchid nurseries.

34
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,159
You can see that because the growing

35
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,320
medium hasn't been changed for a long

36
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,680
time, the roots have become suffocated

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,920
and lack ventilation. This causes many

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,600
roots to rot and turn black, losing

39
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,439
their ability to absorb water and

40
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,439
nutrients, which weakens the plant over

41
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,439
time.

42
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,799
Some roots may appear hollow or slightly

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,720
soft on the outside. Um, this is a sign

44
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,680
that they were previously damaged but

45
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,680
are still trying to keep growing.

46
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,600
You may also notice red mold appearing

47
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,280
on the old leaf sheets. Um, this is a

48
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,479
sign that the growing environment is too

49
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,479
humid and lacks proper ventilation.

50
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,840
If not treated in time, the mold can

51
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,320
spread and affect both the stem and

52
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,840
roots of the plant.

54
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,520
When growing orchids, always follow the

55
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,680
principle, moist but not wet growing

56
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,280
medium. This ensures the roots have

57
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,280
enough moisture to grow while still

58
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,120
staying well ventilated, preventing

59
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,120
water logging, root rot, and fungal

60
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,120
diseases.

61
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,959
With this type of growing medium, you

62
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,879
can see that it retains too much water.

63
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,120
This keeps the area around the roots

64
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,440
constantly wet wet, which can suffocate

65
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,640
them, deprive them of oxygen, and lead

66
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,400
to gradual rotting. Therefore, replacing

67
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,239
it with a more suitable medium is

68
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,490
essential for the plant to recover and

69
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:25,620
grow healthily.

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,120
I will remove all the old growing medium

72
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,599
from the roots. This step helps

73
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,920
eliminate any decayed, moldy, or disease

the roots to breathe and absorb

76
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,760
nutrients better when replanted in the

77
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,760
new medium.

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,479
rinse the entire plant under running

117
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,120
After rinsing, place the orchid in a

118
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,360
cool and well ventilated area to let it

dry completely.

120
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,280
To make a natural fertilizer that helps

121
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,919
the plant recover faster, I use a small

122
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,919
aloe vera leaf.

123
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,840
Aloe vera contains many nutrients and

124
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,080
natural antibacterial properties, making

125
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:16,599
it excellent for stimulating root growth

126
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,599
and healing cuts after root trimming.

127
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,919
After chopping the aloe vera leaf and

128
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:25,400
placing it in a jar, I add about 500 ml

129
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,400
of clean water.

130
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,319
Then I blend the mixture to extract the

131
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,540
maximum amount of nutrients from the

132
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:45,279
aloe vera leaf.

aloe vera leaf.

137
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,039
Next, I dilute the filtered solution

138
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,280
with clean water to make a total of one

139
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,120
liter. Diluting it makes the solution

140
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,800
gentler, safe for the roots, and

141
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,360
suitable for repeated use without

142
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,360
harming the plant.

143
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,000
Next, I will add a small amount of

144
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,920
vitamin B1 to the solution. This

145
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,240
familiar nutrient helps stimulate root

146
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,080

repotting or root trimming.

149
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,880
I use three tablets of vitamin B1 each

150
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,040
containing 2.5 mg.

151
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,519
Then I stir the solution well to fully

152
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,760
dissolve the vitamin B1 in the aloe vera

153
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,240

154
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:21,160
evenly distributed, helping the plant

156
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,200
Then I place the orchid roots into a

181
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,200
Both aloe vera and vitamin B1 contain

nutrients that can be absorbed through

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,600
this solution helps the plant quickly

188
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,160
The nutrients in aloe vera can soften

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:46,519
natural way to improve the plant's

192

vitamin B1 not only nourishes the plant

195
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,640
but also boosts its resistance, helping

196
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,240
it cope better with changing

197
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,710

the pot and choose a moderately sized

206
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,160
pot that gives the roots enough space to

207
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,550
grow while still maintaining proper air

225
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,279
When planting, you need to gently pack

226
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,920

both the top and underside of the

271
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,480

the health of the orchid leaves.

274
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,679
When the leaves are clean and fully

275

307
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,880
After watering or spraying the solution,

308
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,559
you should wipe off any excess water on

309
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,880
the leaf surfaces and in between the

310
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,880
leaf joints.

311
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,440
This helps prevent prolonged moisture,

312
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:34,039
reduces the risk of mold, and keeps the

321
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,050

Thank you for always being with me on

380
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,039
this journey of caring for these beloved

381
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,039
orchids.

382
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,000
When you care for your orchid with all

383
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,320
your love, just as you would for animals

384
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,039
or any living being around you, the

385
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,120
orchid will feel it.

386
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:07,039
With patience, understanding, and love,

387
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,520
the plant will come back to life, grow

388
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:13,590
strong, and bloom beautifully as a

389
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:15,200
gentle way of responding to your care.

[Music]

391
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,720
Stay with me in the upcoming videos

392
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,200
where I'll share more simple yet

393
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,400
effective tips and experiences in orchid

394
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,640
care. Every orchid pot is a little story

395
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:30,320
and you are the one who writes the

396
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,919
radiant ending to that story.

397
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,919
Believe that as long as you pour love

398
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,080
into every drop of water, every gentle

399
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,320
touch on a leaf, your orchid will

400
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,919
respond with wonders. Because caring for

401
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,720
plants is also how we learn to be

402
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:46,000
patient, gentle, and slow down in the

403
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,679
rush of life.

404
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,520
See you in the upcoming videos where

405
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,400
where together we'll nurture not only

406
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:55,600
our orchid pots but also joy and peace

407
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,840
in life. Thank you for always being here

408
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,840
helping me grow a happiness garden every

409
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,840
day.
