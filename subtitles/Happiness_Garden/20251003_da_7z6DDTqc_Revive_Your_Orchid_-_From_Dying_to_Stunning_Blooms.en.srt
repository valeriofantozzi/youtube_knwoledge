00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,880
Welcome to the happiness garden. Today I

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,799
want to tell you the story of the

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,000
journey to revive an orchid that seemed

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,240
to have no chance of survival.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,400
This orchid had only a single leaf left,

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,800
wilted and wrinkled as if all its life

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,119
had left it. But I believe that with a

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,439
little patience and love, even plants

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,439
that seem dead can be revived and bloom

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,439
again.

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,880
So let's begin the journey to revive

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,160
this orchid together.

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,640
This is an orchid that had been

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,640
discarded. Looking at it, the leaves

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,120
were wilted, wrinkled, and seemed

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,680
completely lifeless. But I believe that

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,760
with just a little patience and love,

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,520
even plants that seem dead can be

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,440
revived.

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,640
So, I decided to take the plant home to

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,120
revive it. If you also have a weak plant

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,039
or one that seems beyond saving, don't

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,280
give up. Believe that with just a little

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,320
patience and love, you can completely

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,399
revive your plant. Let's begin step by

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,199
step and witness the miracle happening

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,199
right before your eyes.

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,200
First, I removed all the damaged leaves,

29
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,360
helping to prevent disease from

30
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,200
spreading to the remaining leaf while

31
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,880
allowing the plant to focus on nurturing

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,360
its roots and the single remaining leaf.

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,200
Every care action, no matter how small,

34
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,600
contributes to reviving the plant. And

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,600
step by step, hope rises again in the

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,600
heart.

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,759
Next, we need to check the roots.

39
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:44,000
[Music]

40
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,000
You can see that many roots are hollow.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,720
Probably only one to two fresh roots

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,240
remain. This is exactly why the orchid

43
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,479
cannot absorb enough water and

44
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,690
nutrients, leading to wilted, wrinkled,

45
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,920
and falling leaves.

46
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:59,920
[Music]

47
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,880
All the damaged roots need to be cut

48
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,560
off. This helps remove the rotted parts,

49
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,560
prevents disease from spreading to the

50
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,479
remaining healthy roots, and allows the

51
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,360
plant to focus on nurturing the

52
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,360
remaining strong roots.

53
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,599
Only keep the fresh roots. These roots

54
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,840
will serve as the foundation for the

55
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,680
plant to absorb water and nutrients,

56
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,239
nourishing the single leaf and new

57
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,080
shoots.

58
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,640
After keeping only the fresh roots, I

59
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,800
rinse them under running water. This

60
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,800
helps remove dirt, impurities, and any

61
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,360
remaining pathogens, ensuring the roots

62
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,400
are completely clean and ready to absorb

63
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,400
nutrients from the new substrate.

wonderful to have you along on this

69
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,080
journey.

70
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,519
Next, take about 10 g of ginger to

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,400
prepare fertilizer, which helps

72
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,400
stimulate new root growth. Ginger not

73
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,800
only provides nutrients but also boosts

74
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,280
the plant's resistance, creating a solid

75
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,319
foundation for the revival of the single

76
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,720
leaf and new shoots.

77
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,800
Uh, chop the ginger into small pieces to

78
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,959
prepare for making fertilizer. Chopping

79
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,519
it helps release nutrients faster,

80
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,640
allowing the plant's roots to to absorb

81
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:36,959
them more effectively.

country you are watching the video from.

85
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,519
It's wonderful that we can connect and

86
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,519

[Music]

88
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,150
After chopping, put the ginger into a

89
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:05,599
clean jar to prepare for fermentation.

90

[Music]

91
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,650
Next, add one liter of water for

92
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:18,829
fermentation.

95
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,880
And the final ingredient is rice. Rice

96
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,360
contains plenty of starch and essential

97
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,840
nutrients, helping nourish the roots and

98
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,759
stimulate strong growth of new shoots.

99
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,840
Take three tablespoons of rice and add

100
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,919
them to the ginger and water mixture for

101
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,919
fermentation.

102
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,400
When combined with proper fermentation

103
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,800
steps, this will be the perfect natural

104
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,759
fertilizer, helping the plant regain

105
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,320
vitality, nourish new roots, and prepare

106
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,560
for the vibrant flowers about to bloom.

107
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,800
Then cover the jar and let the mixture

108
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,800
ferment for about 1 hour. This

109
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,199
fermentation time allows the nutrients

110
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,280
from the ginger and rice to fully

111
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,960
dissolve into the water, creating a

112
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:16,800
nutrient-rich liquid fertilizer.

113
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:19,199
[Music]

114
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,120
After fermenting for about 1 hour, stir

115
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,280
well so that the nutrients from the

116
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,759
ginger and rice are fully dissolved in

117
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,479
the water. Stirring thoroughly makes the

118
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,720
liquid fertilizer uniform, ensuring that

119
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,240
every drop watered onto the roots is

120
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,800
nutrient-rich,

121
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,759
stimulating strong new root growth and

122
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,759
restoring the plant's vitality.

123
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,000
After stirring well, strain out the

124
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,919
residue. This makes the fertilizer

125
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,840
solution clear and smooth, allowing it

126
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:52,360
to penetrate the roots easily and

127
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,360
ensuring maximum nutrient absorption.

128
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,800
Uh after straining out the residue, pour

129
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,880
the filtered mixture to soak the wilted

130
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,520
orchid with wrinkled leaves for about 20

131
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,680
minutes. This soaking helps stimulate

132
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,319
new root growth, directly provides

133
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:29,240
nutrients to the remaining live roots,

134
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,240
and awakens the plant's latent vitality.

135
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,520
While waiting for the soak, I repurpose

136
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,520
a plastic cup to use as a seedling

137
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,680

138
00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:00,440
for new root shoots to grow, makes use

139
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,440

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,839
natural fertilizer you just prepared.

192
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,079
It's a smart way to ensure all the

193
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:54,120
orchids in the garden gain vitality and

194
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,120
get ready for vibrant blooms.

195
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,120
When sprayed directly onto the roots and

196
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,279
leaves, the plant also receives starch

197
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,839
and minerals from the rice, helping the

198
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,320
leaf maintain its green color, and the

199
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,480
new shoots grow strong. Using this

200
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,399
mixture not only saves resources, but

201
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,959
also spreads vitality throughout the

202
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:18,120
garden, bringing vibrant flowers in the

203
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,120
near future.

204
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,480
You should spray this mixture every 2

205
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,639
weeks, alternating with regular

206
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,480
watering. This ensures the plant

207
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,240
receives continuous nutrients while

208
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,240
maintaining proper moisture for the

209
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,240
roots.

210
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,600

213
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,079
showing that the plant is recovering

214
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,079
strongly.

215
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,639
The single remaining leaf is still soft,

216
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,519
but new leaves have begun to grow,

217
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,600
bringing full vitality to the plant.

218
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,560
This is proof that with love, patience,

219
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,880
and proper care, even plants that seem

220
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:35,560
beyond saving can be revived, preparing

221
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,560
for the vibrant flowers about to bloom.

[Music]

223
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,120
Um, from now on I use the fermented

224
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,519
ginger and rice fertilizer mixture to

225
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,360
care for this orchid. Providing

226
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,240
nutrients regularly helps the new roots

227
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,240
grow strong, restores the single leaf to

228
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,399
a healthy green, and allows the new

229
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,920
shoots to continue growing robustly,

230
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:07,049

233
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,279
Soak the roots in the mixture for about

234
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,440
20 minutes once a

235
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,920
Soaking helps the roots directly absorb

236
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,399
nutrients from the ginger and rice,

237
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:46,360
stimulating rapid new root growth and

238
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,360
restoring the plant's vitality.

239
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,760
While waiting for the soak, use a soft

240
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,000
cloth to absorb the mixture and gently

241
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,160
wipe both the top and bottom surfaces of

242
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,160
the leaves.

243
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,079
This allows the nutrients from the

244
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,560
ginger and rice to be absorbed directly

245
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:07,040
by the leaves while also cleaning dust

246
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,480
and bacteria, strengthening the leaf's

247
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,440
health and supporting the plant's

248

249
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:27,440
help the orchid revive quickly.

Each time you soak the roots in the

fertilizer, you should also change the

264
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,759
water in the seedling container. This

265
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:10,160
keeps the water clean, prevents bacteria

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,160
orchid will recover strongly, the single

272
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:14,439
leaf will return to a healthy green and

273
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,439
the new shoots will grow robustly.

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,319
Then continue placing the orchid pot in

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,400
sign that the plant is on its journey of

312
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:20,200

314
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,799
Now, I plant the orchid into a new pot

315
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,799
so it has space to grow in an outdoor

new roots to stretch out, absorb

319
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,280
sufficient nutrients and water, and

320
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,760
enables the leaves and new shoots to

321
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,760
grow strong. This is an important step

322
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,919
for the plant to fully recover and

323
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,919
prepare for the vibrant flowers about to
