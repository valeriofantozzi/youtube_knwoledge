the moisture in the air also increases.

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,239
This is when orchids become very

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,400
vulnerable, and it's also the time when

27
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:08,159
fungal diseases become active, putting

28

43
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,119
Um, the main cause of orchid rot during

44
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,720
the rainy season is prolonged water

45
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,720
logging of the roots without timely

46
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,720
drainage.

47
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,960
You'll notice the growing medium is

48
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,600
excessively wet, preventing the roots

49
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,600
from breathing. Grenang

50
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,920
moss medium retains moisture very well

51
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,920
and is especially suitable for

52
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,319
industrial orchid gardens with full

53
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,480
humidity control systems.

54
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,120
But when grown at home, the conditions

55
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,120
are not the same. If humidity cannot be

56
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,920
controlled, orchid roots are very likely

57
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,800
to become water logged and rot, causing

58
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,800
the plant to weaken quickly.

59
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,360
After removing all the old growing

60
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,000
medium, gently trim off the damaged

61
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,239
roots. This helps eliminate the source

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,400
of rot from spreading to the healthy

63
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,560

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,490
focus on nurturing and developing

65
00:02:48,560 --> 00:03:09,519

should rinse the entire orchid with

each orchid pot about twice a month.

193

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,519
flower spike that is continuing to

completed its previous blooming cycle.

202
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,200
This is a clear sign that the plant is

203
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,839

only recovering well after flowering,

225
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:02,440

very effective material,

[Music]

248
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,839
sand has high irerration, retains just

249
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,519
the right amount of moisture and helps

250
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,839
helps prevent root rot during the

251
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,600
sensitive stage. At the same time, its

252
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,000
clean environment limits bacteria and

253
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:26,279

Since the orchid is in a very weak

258
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,600
state, I decided to cut off this flower

259
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,519
spike so the plant doesn't have to use

260
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,200
too much energy. Removing the flower

261
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,040

262
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,120
nutrients on nurturing the roots and

sprinkle a little cinnamon powder on the

268
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,519
cut. Cinnamon has natural antibacterial

269
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,680

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,840
unfolding in your garden. The once weak

380
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,799
orchids now stretch out with strength,

381
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,559
grow roots, and bloom beautifully.

382
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,720
Gradually, your garden will be filled

383
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,559
with the vibrant colors of orchids. Not

384
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,559
just as a gift from nature, but as a

385
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,880
result of your love, patience, and

386
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,880
gentle care.
