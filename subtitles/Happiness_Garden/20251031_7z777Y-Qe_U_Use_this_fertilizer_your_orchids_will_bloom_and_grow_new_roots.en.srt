13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,040
it. It's wonderful to have you along for

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,640
the journey.

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,280
The first ingredient we need is a ripe

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,920
banana. Simple yet rich in wonderful

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,920
nutrients for orchids.

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,760
Uh bananas contain plenty of potassium

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,760
and natural nutrients, helping orchid

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,000
leaves become glossier and stimulating

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,879
the plant to bloom continuously and

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,879
persistently over time.

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,320
In addition, uh the vitamins and

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,239
minerals in bananas also support strong

25
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,239
root growth, helping the plant absorb

26
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:08,519
nutrients more effectively and recover

27
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,519
more quickly after each blooming cycle.

28
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,439
After slicing the banana into thin

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,439
pieces, gently place them all into a

30
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,520
clean jar, preparing for the

31
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,340
fermentation step to extract the best

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:28,080
natural nutrients for your orchids.

33
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:30,159
[Music]

34
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,119
The next ingredient is eggshells. And

35
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,960
you only need about two eggshells to

36
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,810
provide the essential minerals for your

37
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,909
orchids.

38
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,909
[Music]

39
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,200
Eggshells contain plenty of natural

40
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,799
calcium, which is very good for orchids,

41
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,040
helping the stems and leaves become

42
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,759
stronger and maintain a healthy green

43
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,759
color throughout their growth.

44
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,240
Next, add about 500 ml of water.

45
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,959
Then blend the entire mixture until all

46
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,959
the nutrients are fully combined.

47
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,200
Uh leave a comment telling me which

48
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,040
country you're watching from. Uh it's

49
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,120
amazing that we can connect and chat

50
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,680
together from all around the world.

51
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,599
Once blended, pour the mixture into a

52
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,280
clean jar to begin the fermentation

53
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,440
process, allowing the nutrients to

54
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,160
ferment naturally and become more easily

55
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,160
absorbed by your orchids.

56
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,879
[Music]

57
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,200
Seal the jar tightly and place it in a

58
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,959
cool, airy spot for about 3 weeks,

59
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,680
allowing the mixture to ferment slowly

60
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,080
and create the best natural nutrients

61
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,080
for your orchids.

62
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,239
During the first week, open the lid once

63
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,319
a day to release the fermentation gases

64
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,560
and keep the mixture ventilated, helping

65
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,720
it ferment more evenly and creating a

66
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,720
truly safe nutrient source for your

67
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,720
orchids.

68
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,040
Uh, this orchid has just finished its

69
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,200
blooming cycle and right now it needs

70
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,120
more energy to recover, nourish its

71
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,480
roots, and prepare for the next

72
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,480
flowering phase.

73
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,560
Normally, after finishing a blooming

74
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,560
season, an orchid needs about 8 to 12

75
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,360
months to recover and accumulate enough

76
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,280
energy before blooming again. But if you

77
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,840
you care for it properly and provide the

78
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,920
natural nutrients it needs, then in just

79
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,040
3 to 4 months, the orchid can enter a

80
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:57,159
new blooming cycle, healthier and more

81
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,159
vibrant, vibrant than ever.

82
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,159
What you need to do now is remove all

83
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,640
the damaged, weak, or rotten roots so

84
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,920
the plant no longer wastes energy trying

85
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,000
to sustain nonfunctional roots. Once

86
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,000
they are removed, the orchid will focus

87
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,540
its strength on developing healthier new

88
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,560
roots.

89
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:21,359
[Music]

90
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,600
Next, gently remove the old and damaged

91
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,840
leaves as they no longer contribute

92
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,680
nutrients to the plant. Once these

93
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,280
weaker parts are cleared away, the

94
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,280
orchid will be better ventilated and

95
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,440
able to focus all its energy on

96
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,440
regenerating new healthy leaves and

97
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,440
roots.

98
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,639
Then cut off the old flower spike as it

99
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,520
has completed its purpose and can no

100
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,199
longer produce new buds. Removing it

101
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,520
helps the plant redirect its energy

102
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:55,880
toward regenerating roots and leaves and

103
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,880
preparing for the next blooming cycle.

104
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,920
[Music]

105
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,080
This is the fermented product after 3

106
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,919
weeks. And you can recognize good

107
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,120
quality when the mixture gives off a

108
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:15,039
light, mild, and pleasant fragrance. On

109
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,520
the other hand, if it has an unusual,

110
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,280
unpleasant smell, you should discard it

111
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,840
and make a new batch to ensure the

112
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,840
safety of your orchids.

113
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,320
Take about 50 ml of the fermented

114
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,560
mixture to prepare for dilution,

115
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,759
ensuring the solution is gentle and safe

116
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,759
for the orchid roots when applied.

117
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,160
Then add one liter of water to dilute

118
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,560
the 50mm mixture, creating a natural

119
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,720
nutrient solution that absorbs quickly

120
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,050
and is ideal for watering or soaking

121
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,189
orchid roots.

122
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,189
[Applause]

123
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,840
Step one, after mixing, use a soft cloth

124
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,600
to gently absorb the solution. Then

125
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,000
carefully wipe both the top and

126
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,000
underside of the leaves. This helps the

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,840
leaves absorb nutrients better and

128
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,840
maintain their natural glossy green

129
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,840
appearance.

130
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,560
Wiping the leaves with the fermented

131
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,720
banana and eggshell mixture first helps

132
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,560
the orchid leaves become naturally

133
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,840
naturally glossy as the nutrients are

134
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,080
absorbed directly through the leaf

135
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,479
surface giving them a fresher and

136
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,479
healthier appearance.

137
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,319
U when the leaf surf surfaces are gently

138
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,880
cleaned and nourished in this way, the

139
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,680
plant photosynthesizes more effectively,

140
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:57,720
absorbs light fully and converts energy

141
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,720
better for the recovery process.

142
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,759
Moreover, the nutrient layer from the

143
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,240
fermented mixture also helps prevent

144
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,319
mold and bacteria, keeping the leaves

145
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,540
well ventilated and minimizing common

146
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:15,919
orchid diseases.

147
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:18,080
[Music]

148
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,440
With regular protection and nourishment,

149
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,919
the orchid will strengthen its

150
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,639
resistance, recover quickly after each

151
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:27,100
blooming cycle, and maintain a stable

152
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:32,160
condition with less weakening.

153
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:34,240
[Music]

154
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,639
And when the leaves are healthy and

155
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,720
photosynthesizing well, the plant will

156
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,520
have enough energy to stimulate new root

157
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,039
growth and sprout young leaves, laying

158
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,700
the foundation for more beautiful and

159
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:50,479
sustainable blooming seasons ahead.

160
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:52,800
[Music]

161
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,280
Step two, pour the diluted solution into

162
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,919
a spray bottle ready to mist evenly over

163
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,000
the orchid leaves and roots. This method

164
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,000
helps the nutrients absorb quickly,

165
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,560
distribute evenly, and reach all parts

166
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,560
of the plant easily.

167
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,800
When spraying the mixture onto the

168
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,960
leaves and roots, the nutrients are

169
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,639
absorbed directly, allowing the orchid

170
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,879
to quickly take in essential vitamins

171
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:21,639
and minerals, nourishing it from root to

172
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,639
tip and promoting overall growth.

173
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,240
Thanks to the evenly distributed

174
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,880
nutrients, the plant will enhance its

175
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,120
photosynthesis, resulting in greener and

176
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,959
more vibrant leaves while efficiently

177
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:41,159
converting energy to recover quickly

178
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,159
after each blooming cycle.

179
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,920
At the same time, the thin layer of

180
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,480
solution covering the leaf surface also

181
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,480
helps prevent mold and bacteria, keeping

182
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,920
the leaves and roots well ventilated and

183
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,920
reducing the risk of pests and diseases.

184
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,839
Thanks to the potassium and calcium from

185
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,160
the mixture being absorbed evenly into

186
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,040
the roots and leaves, the plant will

187
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,200
stimulate new root growth, sprout young

188
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,360
leaves, and prepare flowers for the next

189
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,760
season, ensuring a faster and stronger

190
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,760
growth cycle.

191
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,080
Alternatively, you can also water this

192
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,560
fertilizer mixture directly onto the

193
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,399
roots and growing medium, allowing the

194
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,959
nutrients to penetrate deeply into the

195
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,279
root system, nourish the plant from

196
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,360
within, and keep the medium moderately

197
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,360
moist, supporting healthy root

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,360
development.

199
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,560
When watering directly onto the roots,

200
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,800
the nutrients penetrate deeply into the

201
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,360
soil and growing medium, helping the

202
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,839
roots quickly absorb essential minerals

203
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,700
and vitamins, promoting healthy growth

204
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:06,640
from root to tip.

[Music]

206
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,560
Even watering also helps maintain stable

207
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,720
moisture in the growing medium, creating

208
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,360
an ideal environment for new roots to

209
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,920
grow quickly and anchor firmly while

210
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,690
reducing the risk of roots drying out or

211
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,789
wilting.

[Music]

213
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,160
After watering, you can soak the orchid

214
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,000
roots in this mixture for about 20

215
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,920
minutes, allowing the nutrients to

216
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,480
penetrate deeper, helping the roots

217
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,880
fully absorb them and enabling the plant

218
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,200
to recover quickly, ready for strong

219
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,200
growth ahead.

220
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,399
After soaking for about 20 minutes,

221
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,240
remember to remove the orchid pot from

222
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,120
the mixture so the roots are not

223
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,120
submerged for too long, preventing root

224
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,000
rot and preparing the plant for the next

225
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,320
care stage.

226
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,079
Next, sprinkle a little cinnamon powder

227
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,240
on the cut of the flower spike to

228
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,480
provide antibacterial protection,

229
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,640
prevent mold, and help the cut heal

230
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:15,160
quickly, safeguarding the plant from

231
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,160
diseases after removing the old flowers.

232
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,240
If water remains on the leaves, use a

233
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,240
dry cloth to absorb all the droplets

234
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,160
from the leaf crevices, especially on

235
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,839
young leaves, to prevent moisture from

236
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,160
causing mold and to keep the leaves dry

237
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,160
and healthy.

239
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,320
After the leaves have dried, you should

240
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,640
place the orchid in a cool, airy spot

241
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,800
with enough indirect light so the roots

242
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,640
and leaves recover well and the

243
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,200
nutrients from the fertilizer mixture

244
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:01,320
are optimally absorbed, preparing the

245
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,320
plant for the next blooming phase.

And here are the results after 3 months

248
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,519
of caring for the orchid with natural

249
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,560
fertilizer following the end of its

250
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,399
blooming cycle.

251
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,560
You can see the lush green leaves,

252
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,279
strong root growth, and that the plant

253
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,760
is ready for the next blooming season

254
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,760
full of vitality.

255
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,440
And you can see that the orchid has

256
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,760
grown two new flower stems, one

257
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,920
developing vigorously, while the other

258
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:38,440
has just emerged, signaling a promising

259
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,440
and brilliant next blooming season.

260
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,639
Uh the leaves have become glossy which

261
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,200
shows that the orchid is absorbing

262
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,279
nutrients very well, healthy from root

263
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,680
to tip and ready for the upcoming

264
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,680
blooming cycles.

265
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,519
Both the large flower stem and the newly

266
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,519
emerging small stem are very healthy,

267
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,760
indicating that the orchid has been

268
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,000
properly cared for and has enough energy

269
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,800
to support blooming while maintaining

270
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,800
lasting vitality.

271
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,440
Um the roots in the pot as well as the

272
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,760
aerial roots are both growing vigorously

273
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,519
showing that both the natural fertilizer

274
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,760
and the orchid microclimate environment

275
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,399
are very suitable helping the plant

276
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,399
absorb nutrients optimally and develop

277
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,399
comprehensively.
