Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:13,898
To help orchids grow quickly in this video, I share how to help sick orchids recover quickly 

3
00:00:13,898 --> 00:00:20,896
and shoot many baby orchids at the same time.

4
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:29,895
Helps orchids shoot many plants at the same time in the same pot.

5
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:34,894
and blooms a lot of flowers.

6
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:43,892
An orchid has rot disease.

7
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:53,890
The cause of the disease is fungi and bacteria that cause leaf rot.

8
00:01:03,888 --> 00:01:12,886
If rot is not treated promptly, it will spread and cause the orchid to die.

9
00:01:22,596 --> 00:01:28,883
I need to check the roots.

10
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:40,881
Then cut off all damaged roots.

11
00:01:53,258 --> 00:01:59,877
Then rinse with water.

12
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:15,874
Take 2 liters of water.

13
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:33,870
Add 5 vitamin B1 tablets.

14
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:42,868
Vitamin B1 helps stimulate rooting and germination very quickly.

15
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:57,899
Take 1 aloe vera leaf and cut it into thin slices.

16
00:03:00,091 --> 00:03:10,896
Soak aloe vera in Vitamin B1 water.

17
00:03:10,896 --> 00:03:19,461
and wait 10 minutes for the nutrients to completely dissolve in the water.

18
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:35,891
Then filter this water.

19
00:03:46,174 --> 00:03:55,887
Soak the orchid branches in this water for 20 minutes.

20
00:03:55,887 --> 00:04:02,886
Helps stimulate the growth of roots and sprouts very quickly.

21
00:04:07,885 --> 00:04:18,403
Using a pine bark growing medium helps maintain moisture and proper drainage.

22
00:04:35,078 --> 00:04:46,877
Add moss on top.

23
00:04:55,575 --> 00:05:06,873
Take a cotton ball and soak it in this water.

24
00:05:15,847 --> 00:05:26,869
Then incubate the orchid roots.

25
00:05:30,668 --> 00:05:38,900
Incubate for a day then take out. This helps stimulate rapid root and sprout growth.

26
00:05:51,364 --> 00:06:00,896
From now on spray this water on the leaves once a week.

27
00:06:02,723 --> 00:06:12,893
and water the roots with this water once a week.

28
00:06:18,192 --> 00:06:24,891
Place in a cool, well-lit place for 1 day.

29
00:06:32,406 --> 00:06:34,406
After 1 day, remove the cotton from the orchid roots.

30
00:06:49,202 --> 00:06:58,415
Take the transparent plastic box and snap it up.

31
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:05,883
and place it in a cool, well-lit place.

32
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:18,880
Spray aloe vera water and B1 once a week.

33
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:31,878
Water aloe vera and B1 once a week.

34
00:07:47,874 --> 00:07:50,874
1 MONTH LATER.

35
00:08:00,296 --> 00:08:10,870
The orchid has grown two sprouts on both sides.

36
00:08:24,184 --> 00:08:33,899
Continue spraying aloe vera water and B1 once a week.

37
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:46,896
and Continue watering aloe vera and B1 once a week

38
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,892
AFTER NEXT 1 MONTH.

39
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:23,889
The 2 shoots are growing healthily but have not yet taken root.

40
00:09:32,032 --> 00:09:42,885
Continue watering aloe vera and B1 once a week.

41
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:55,882
And continue to spray aloe vera water and B1 once a week.

42
00:10:18,796 --> 00:10:21,877
After the next 2 months.

43
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:36,874
The orchid has developed healthy roots, stems, and leaves.

44
00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:51,871
and has developed more buds (flower branches)

45
00:10:51,871 --> 00:10:59,870
Thank you for watching the video. Good luck and see you in the next videos!
