every leaf and every flower tells you a

gentle story of love and life.

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,599
In this video, I continue sharing with

you how to make natural fertilizer,

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,240
gentle yet highly effective to help

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,920
revive your orchid after it has finished

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,320
blooming so it can keep growing strong

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,320
and bloom again like a radiant gift from

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,320

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,440
Let's get started. This is an orchid

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,920
that people once thought was dead and

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,440
thrown away, but I picked it up because

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,079
I believe that with just a little hope

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,440
and gentle care, it could come back to

17
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,920
life and bloom once again.

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,399
First, you need to gently remove the

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,399
yellow and damaged leaves because they

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,480
no longer contribute to the plant's life

21
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,590
and only hinder its natural recovery

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:12,610
process.

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,759
Next, trim off the withered flower

25
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,520
spikes because once they've lost their

26
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,520
original beauty, they should be removed

27
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,920
so the plant can focus on nourishing its

28
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:28,360
roots and leaves, preparing for a

29
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,360
vibrant new blooming season.

35
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,520
The damaged roots, the hollow ones that

36
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,240
can no longer absorb water and nutrients

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,240
need to be cut off.

38
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,200
This is like helping the plant let go of

39
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:03,479
its burdens so it can focus its energy

40
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,479
on nurturing the healthy parts.

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,600
Cutting off the damaged roots also helps

42
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,840
the plant avoid the risk of rot

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,680

44
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,340

emerging from the leaf axle and getting

204
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,480
I continue caring for the plant by

205
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:37,480
applying natural fertilizer made from

206

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,320
produce not only more flowers, but also

358
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,400

help the plant recover and grow better.

After removing the damaged leaves, we

373
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,760
need to carefully check the roots and

374
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,159
the orchid's growing medium to ensure

375
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:44,440

380
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,679
Um, this orchid pot I bought from an

381
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,520
industrial orchid garden is entirely

382
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,799
planted with moss which helps retain

383
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,159
moisture very well. However, if um if

384
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,600
the watering is not carefully

385
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,840
controlled, the plant is very prone to

386
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,840
root rot.

387
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,159
Therefore, I will remove about 2/3 of

388
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,960
the old moss and replace it with new

389
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:05,120
growing medium, which is pine bark. uh

390
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,799
to help the roots stay more airrated and

391
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,799
prevent water logging.

392
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,720
You should not completely remove the old

393
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:15,520
growing medium because the orchid still

394
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:20,280
has flowers. Keeping it will help to

395
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,280
maintain moisture and grow steadily.

396
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,679
Then remove the wilted flowers to help

397
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,840
the orchid focus its energy on

398
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,080
developing new buds and extend the

399

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,440
Next, we will prepare natural fertilizer

402
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,679

570
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,320
Next, spread a little moss on top of the

571
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,640
pot to help retain moisture for the

572
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,200
plant while providing a gentle

573
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,140
protective layer for the orchid roots,

574
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:15,599
promoting healthy growth.

578
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,679
After planting, water the orchid with

579
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,679
this mixture once a week to provide

580
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,000
regular nutrients, support the plant's

581
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,480
strong growth, and help maintain its

582
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:55,200
overall health.

584
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,920
Um, after each watering, soak the orchid

585
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,760
pot in this mixture for about 20 minutes

586
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,760
to help the plant absorb the maximum

587
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,760
nutrients.

588
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,320
Then take the orchid pot out and place

589
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,160
it in a spot with gentle sunlight or

590
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,800
diffused light to allow effective

591
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:17,630
photosynthesis, boost metabolism, and

592
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,789
support healthy plant growth.

[Music]

594
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,599
To protect the new roots as they grow,

595
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,400
we need to secure the orchid with a

596
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:30,960
support stick to stabilize its position,

597
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,440
prevent movement that could break tender

598
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,119
roots, and create favorable conditions

599
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,950
for the plant to anchor itself to the

600
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:47,280
growing medium.

602
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,880
Remember, no matter how good the

603
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,200
fertilizer is, if the orchid lacks

604
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,640
sunlight, it will grow slowly, be prone

605
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:59,040
to rot, and will not be able to bloom.

606
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,040
Therefore, always place the orchid pot

607
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,040
in a spot with gentle sunlight so the

608
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,960
plant can photosynthesize, absorb

609
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,290
nutrients efficiently, and grow

610
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:15,680
healthily.

613
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,520

You will see new roots have grown which

617
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:36,920
shows that the orchid is recovering and

618
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,920
growing healthily.

619
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,480
These new roots help the orchid absorb

620
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,000
nutrients and water better, supporting

621
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,000
strong growth in the next blooming

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000

started growing new buds, which proves

645
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,680
that the natural fertilizer recovery

646

process not only helps the plant become

647
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,760
healthier, but also stimulates
