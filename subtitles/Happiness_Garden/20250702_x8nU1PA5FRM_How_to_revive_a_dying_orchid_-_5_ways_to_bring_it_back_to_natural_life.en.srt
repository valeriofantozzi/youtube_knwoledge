Welcome to my channel where I share

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,120
gentle, natural, and easy to understand

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,800
ways to care for orchids.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,000
Today, I will show you how to revive a

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,920
rotting orchid like this.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,240
Uh, when the orchid has lost all its

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:21,320
leaves, leaving only the bare stem and a

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,320
few dry roots, don't assume it's dead.

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,320
In fact, there is still hidden life

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,400
inside waiting to be awakened. With a

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,640
little patience and love, you will see a

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,840
miracle happen. New shoots will

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,840
gradually begin to appear again.

[Music]

15
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,160
You can still see a few fresh roots.

16
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,320
That's a sign that the orchid is quietly

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,000
alive and waiting for a chance to come

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,320
back.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,399
With proper care, these roots will

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,039
continue to grow and nourish the whole

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,800
plant back to health.

22
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,719
The first step is to gently inspect the

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,840
entire root system and trim away any

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,840
damaged or rotten parts.

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,119
Removing the dead roots will help the

26
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,360
plant focus its energy on nourishing the

27
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,430
healthy parts and prepare for the

28
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,539
recovery process.

[Music]

35
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,479
After trimming the roots, you can apply

36
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,479
a bit of melted candle wax to the cut

37
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,479
areas.

38
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,680
This layer of wax will help protect the

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,840
wound, preventing water from seeping in

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,079
and reducing the risk of stem rot. A

41
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,040
small but very important step to ensure

42
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,040
the plant recovers safely.

50
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:24,360
Prepare a clean container. Then add

51
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,360
about 2 teaspoon of cinnamon powder.

52
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,040
Cinnamon powder not only has natural

53
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,280
antibacterial properties but also helps

54
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,040
stimulate strong root growth, making it

55
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,360
very useful in the orchid's recovery

56
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,850
process.

59
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,000
Next, pour one liter of boiled water

60
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,160
into the container. The hot water will

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,160
help extract the maximum nutrients and

62
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,239
essential oils from the cinnamon powder,

63
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,720
creating a natural solution that both

64
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,720
disinfects and stimulates orchid root

65
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,720
growth.

[Music]

67
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,239
After adding the boiling water, simply

68
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:15,300
cover the container and let it sit until

69
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:24,080
the water has completely cooled.

71
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,159
Once the water has cooled, use a clean

72
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,840
cloth or strainer to remove the

73
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,840
remaining cinnamon powder residue.

75
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,599
Careful straining will make the solution

76
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,160
clearer, easier to absorb, and safer to

77
00:03:51,599 --> 00:04:02,599
use on orchid roots.

80
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,280
Once you have the clear cinnamon

81
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,840
solution, gently place the orchid stem

82
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,079
and roots into it and soak for about 20

83
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,759
minutes.

84
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,080
This is the ideal time for the

85
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,160
antibacterial and growth stimulating

86
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,400
properties of the cinnamon to deeply

87
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:33,560
penetrate the plant tissue, helping to

88
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,560
protect and support effective recovery.

89
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,800
You can pour the remaining solution into

90
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,800
a spray bottle to make use of it. Um,

91
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,800
lightly spraying it on the leaves and

92
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,199
roots of other healthy orchids will help

93
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,360
boost their resistance, prevent fungal

94
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,770
diseases, and stimulate better daily

95
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,029
growth.

After soaking for 20 minutes, you can

99
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,520
gently take the plant out and start

100
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,520
replanting it in a new pot.

101
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,600
This is the perfect time for the plant

102
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,280
to begin its journey of revival with a

103
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,759
solid foundation from the roots that

104
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,360
have been cleaned and protected.

105
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,720
You should use pine bark combined with

106
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,039
dry pummus to repot the plant. Uh this

107
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,039
growing medium mixture allows for quick

108
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,039
drainage, keeping the roots dry and well

109
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,680
airrated, which helps prevent water

110
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,560
logging and root rot. Uh one of the main

111
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,960
causes of orchid decline. You can spread

112
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,000
a thin layer of moss on the surface of

113
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,240
the pot after planting. After planting,

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,080
place the orchid pot in a cool spot with

115
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,639
gentle light for 3 days and avoid

116
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,080
watering to let the cuts dry. The roots

117
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,840
adapt to the medium and prevent rot.

118
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,880
After 3 days, you can start watering

119
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,560
lightly to keep the plant moist.

120
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,400
Uh when the growing medium is dry,

121
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,199
lightly mist the roots and surface of

122
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,960
the pot to maintain moisture. Consistent

123
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,199
care will help the plant recover and

124
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,199
grow well.

125
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,160
You can use a clear plastic container

126
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,240
with ventilation holes to cover the

127
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,080
orchid pot.

128
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,520
The stable, humid environment inside

129
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,520

130
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,520
quickly.

132
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,759
consistent care.

133
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,440

Wipe the orchid leaves with GE ginger

once a month so that orchids are best

Uh, yeast brewed from fresh ginger has

00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,160
the effect of stimulating sprouting,

587
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:06,319
strong rooting, repelling insects,

588
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:09,599
killing fungi, stimulating buds, and

589
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:12,079
stimulating growth.

590
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:14,240
GE ginger also helps orchids increase

591
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:17,680
their ability to absorb nutrients from

592
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:21,599
the fertilizer you fertilize them.

593
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:23,599
Only do this one to two times a month.

594
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:26,750
Do not use too much as it will affect

595
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:29,680

601
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:48,520
These roots will help the orchid absorb

nutrients more easily and more.

603
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:54,130
Orchids grow well or not thanks to the

photosynthesis of roots and leaves.

orchid branch blooms the last flowers,

610
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,800
then there will be new flowers that
