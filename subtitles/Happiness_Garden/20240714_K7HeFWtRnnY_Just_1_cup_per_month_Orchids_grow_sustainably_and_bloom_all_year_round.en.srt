00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:24,920
welcome to my channel

2
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,783
Today I would like to introduce to you an interesting video on how to use carrots

3
00:00:28,868 --> 00:00:31,710
help orchids bloom many times a year

4
00:00:31,813 --> 00:00:36,981
There are many people who are passionate about growing orchids and want them to always bloom and stay lush wherever they are.

5
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,142
However, sometimes you have a situation where your orchid doesn't bloom

6
00:00:40,227 --> 00:00:42,227
or slow flowering.

7
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,329
make orchid growers feel disappointed

8
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:48,111
But don't worry, because in the video you will be shown how to help orchids bloom several times a year.

9
00:00:50,072 --> 00:00:55,460
Carrots are not only a nutritious dish, but also a simple and effective solution to this problem

10
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:03,804
With just a few simple steps as shown in the video, you can stimulate flowers to bloom quickly

11
00:01:03,804 --> 00:01:18,378
So watch the video and learn how to use the carrot tool to

12
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:27,907
help your orchid bloom instantly and bloom many times a year.

13
00:01:27,907 --> 00:01:34,517
Use the peel of 1 carrot,

14
00:01:34,517 --> 00:01:41,634
add 10 grams of fresh ginger,

15
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:46,257
add 1 liter of water

16
00:01:46,257 --> 00:01:50,133
puree

17
00:02:05,257 --> 00:02:19,336
Leave in a dark place for 6 hours

18
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:31,928
After incubation for 6 hours

19
00:02:43,505 --> 00:02:53,134
filter out residue

20
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:14,934
Add water to make 4 liters of solution

21
00:03:16,765 --> 00:03:25,559
now irrigate this way,

22
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:33,686
Soak orchid root in carrot juice for about 5 minutes

23
00:03:33,686 --> 00:03:42,918
This will make it easier for the roots to absorb nutrients.

24
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:57,959
and repeat this once a month

25
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:09,575
Carrots contain many vitamins, amino acids and minerals such as:

26
00:04:09,575 --> 00:04:22,340
protein, phosphorus and lots of potassium.

27
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:36,069
The nutrients and vitamins in carrots will help orchids grow better,

28
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:50,885
Increase the resistance and vitality of plants,

29
00:04:50,885 --> 00:05:01,734
help it easily adapt to the living environment.

30
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:18,901
In addition, watering plants from carrots also helps to increase the humidity of the surrounding environment,

31
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:32,678
help orchids have better growing conditions.

32
00:05:32,678 --> 00:05:49,994
The natural sugar and potassium content in carrots makes it easier for orchids to absorb

33
00:05:49,994 --> 00:06:11,663
Potassium and sugar stimulate flower growth very quickly

34
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:27,224
It also helps orchids tolerate drought very well

35
00:06:27,224 --> 00:06:32,847
so that the flowers don't fall

36
00:06:32,847 --> 00:06:40,941
and lots of buds

37
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:55,331
As you can see this orchid has 5-6 flower branches

38
00:06:55,331 --> 00:07:09,714
However, to help orchids bloom all year round, it is necessary to create suitable environmental conditions such as:

39
00:07:09,714 --> 00:07:17,455
the right light, the right humidity, and the right wind

40
00:07:17,455 --> 00:07:23,361
You should also not overuse the use of carrots.

41
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:33,451
because it will make the orchid have a disorder in nutrient absorption,

42
00:07:33,451 --> 00:07:38,414
it will not benefit the orchids,

43
00:07:38,414 --> 00:07:44,259
Best to only apply once a month

44
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:50,110
and need to combine the use of other organic fertilizers such as fish protein, soy protein

45
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:54,923
and pea protein fertilizer like the video I guide to take care of

46
00:07:54,923 --> 00:07:58,084
so orchids will grow and bloom all year round

47
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:04,871
Welcome to part 2 of this video

48
00:08:04,871 --> 00:08:13,603
If you have an orchid, make sure you want it to bloom for a long time.

49
00:08:13,603 --> 00:08:25,634
Orchids are known for their ability to keep flowers on their branches for 3 to 6 months.

50
00:08:25,634 --> 00:08:36,632
For that to happen, you need to nurture, water, and feed it well.

51
00:08:36,632 --> 00:08:46,630
Now I will show you what is the best fertilizer for orchids.

52
00:08:46,630 --> 00:09:01,627
If you follow us till the end of this video, you will learn how to make orchids bloom like crazy.

53
00:09:01,627 --> 00:09:05,626
Now let's get started

54
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:27,621
Take a bowl and put 5 tablespoons of rice in it.

55
00:09:28,621 --> 00:09:35,620
Pour in 500ml of water at room temperature.

56
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:47,617
Mix the rice well and wash the rice before cooking.

57
00:09:51,617 --> 00:10:01,615
Then filter the water to wash the rice.

58
00:10:09,613 --> 00:10:15,612
Use a cotton ball soaked in water to wash this rice

59
00:10:15,612 --> 00:10:32,609
Then wipe on the top and bottom of the leaves

60
00:10:32,609 --> 00:10:44,606
Will help clean the surface of the leaves

61
00:10:45,606 --> 00:10:55,604
remove disease fungi and insects on orchids

62
00:10:56,604 --> 00:11:09,601
At the same time, it provides the necessary nutrients for the orchid's growth

63
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:26,631
Repeat after 2 weeks will help the orchid stay green

64
00:11:28,631 --> 00:11:41,628
Or you can also pour the rice water into a spray bottle.

65
00:11:46,627 --> 00:11:59,625
Then spray evenly on the top and bottom of the leaves

66
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:18,621
This method also has the same effect as the previous method using cotton balls

67
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:28,619
Note Do not spray rice water on flowers

68
00:12:30,618 --> 00:12:41,616
Now take a deep bowl in which you will place the orchid ready for watering and soaking.

69
00:12:41,616 --> 00:12:56,613
Rice water is a great natural fertilizer for orchids, as it encourages the flowering of this beautiful plant.

70
00:12:56,613 --> 00:13:15,610
You can soak the orchid in this rice water for about 1 hour so that the orchid roots can absorb the most nutrients.

71
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:29,607
Then, remove and repeat this treatment every 14 days.

72
00:13:32,606 --> 00:13:59,601
You can also freeze rice water to water your orchids.

73
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:18,630
When needed, you just need to take a few dice.

74
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:36,627
Wait for them to defrost and reach room temperature, you can feed your orchids again.

75
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:48,624
Never place frozen blocks directly on the base of the orchid

76
00:14:48,624 --> 00:14:56,623
Because orchids don't like the cold.

77
00:14:56,623 --> 00:15:10,620
After only 2-3 weeks of use, the leaves will be green

78
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:24,617
New roots will grow

79
00:15:24,617 --> 00:15:43,614
This will help the orchid best absorb nutrients through the roots

80
00:15:43,614 --> 00:15:53,612
With enough nutrition, your orchid will flower all year round

81
00:15:53,612 --> 00:15:58,611
And that will be all we have prepared for you for this video.

82
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:03,876
Welcome to part 3 of this video

83
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:10,375
When orchids have enough nutrients and a good soil environment,

84
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:16,374
The plant will grow strongly and flower more.

85
00:16:16,374 --> 00:16:25,372
In this video, I share a type of fertilizer that few people know about.

86
00:16:26,372 --> 00:16:31,371
Come explore with me now.

87
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:41,369
When you grow many orchids, it is inevitable that orchids will rot.

88
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:51,400
If it accidentally rots, you need to immediately cut off the rotten part.

89
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:59,399
Then isolate the rotten orchid pot from other normal orchid pots.

90
00:17:02,398 --> 00:17:10,396
This helps prevent rot from spreading to normal orchids.

91
00:17:36,391 --> 00:17:43,390
Then cut off all damaged roots.

92
00:18:01,386 --> 00:18:07,385
This is charcoal

93
00:18:26,381 --> 00:18:36,379
and grind into powder.

94
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:10,373
Then sprinkle activated charcoal powder on the newly cut wound.

95
00:19:12,372 --> 00:19:20,371
Helps cuts heal faster and eliminates fungal diseases.

96
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:29,369
Because activated carbon has a very good disinfection function.

97
00:19:31,368 --> 00:19:39,400
Then you sprinkle more on the orchid root.

98
00:19:52,398 --> 00:20:00,396
Then place the orchid pot in a cool place and do not water for 1 week and the orchid will recover.

99
00:20:00,396 --> 00:20:02,396
Next way.

100
00:20:04,395 --> 00:20:12,394
Mix 3 tablespoons of activated carbon with 2 liters of water.

101
00:20:47,387 --> 00:20:55,885
Then use this water to water the orchid roots.

102
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:06,883
Do this periodically every 2 weeks for normal orchids.

103
00:21:08,883 --> 00:21:16,881
Helps prevent disease and improve pH in growing media.

104
00:21:18,881 --> 00:21:26,879
Activated carbon also contains high levels of calcium and natural minerals that are very good for orchids.

105
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:30,378
Helps stimulate rooting.

106
00:21:33,378 --> 00:21:41,376
Soak the orchid pot in this water for 20 minutes.

107
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:52,374
After 20 minutes, take out the orchid pot.

108
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:20,368
Then filter to get clear water.

109
00:22:41,398 --> 00:22:50,396
Next method: Use this water to thoroughly wipe the top and bottom of the leaves

110
00:22:54,395 --> 00:23:02,393
The orchid will be protected from fungi and insects.

111
00:23:07,392 --> 00:23:16,391
The calcium content in activated carbon helps make leaves strong.

112
00:23:42,385 --> 00:23:52,383
Do this regularly every 2 weeks and you will be as healthy as this.

113
00:24:18,378 --> 00:24:26,377
Next method: You can also use this water to spray the entire orchid plant.

114
00:24:32,376 --> 00:24:40,374
Helps eliminate fungi and insects on leaves very well.

115
00:24:44,373 --> 00:24:52,372
and it also provides some nutrients through its leaves and roots very effectively

116
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:16,400
Now let's see the results.

117
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:23,399
Many new roots grow.

118
00:25:30,397 --> 00:25:40,395
Helps orchids absorb nutrients best.

119
00:25:47,394 --> 00:25:55,392
The potassium and phosphorus content in activated carbon stimulates plants to root extremely quickly.

120
00:26:11,389 --> 00:26:19,388
Many flower buds grow on the same tree.

121
00:26:22,387 --> 00:26:30,386
The potassium content in charcoal helps prevent flower buds from falling off

122
00:26:43,383 --> 00:26:49,382
The flowers are brighter and stronger.

123
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:30,374
Surely you will be surprised with this type of fertilizer.

124
00:27:34,373 --> 00:27:40,372
If you find it interesting, please like and share it with many people.
