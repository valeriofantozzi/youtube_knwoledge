Hello friends.

2
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:11,498
In order for Phalaenopsis orchids to grow and produce many flowers, you need to note the following:

3
00:00:13,677 --> 00:00:21,663
Phalaenopsis orchids like temperatures from 20-30 degrees Celsius.

4
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:33,227
The best place to place the orchid pot is on the windowsill or under the sun filter for the orchid.

5
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:45,925
If the temperature is below 20 degrees Celsius, you can place the orchid pot in direct sunlight.

6
00:00:47,924 --> 00:00:54,990
Phalaenopsis orchid with its beautiful,

7
00:00:54,990 --> 00:01:04,688
and noble beauty is one of the favorite and popular indoor flowers.

8
00:01:05,688 --> 00:01:11,186
Its beauty is the pride of anyone,

9
00:01:11,186 --> 00:01:18,685
especially because of its ability to produce many flowers and long-lasting flowers.

10
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:26,950
 
This is corn kernels.

11
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:33,131
it can be used as a natural fertilizer for orchids.

12
00:01:34,234 --> 00:01:40,447
Take a small handful and put it in a jar.

13
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:55,467
Soak in 1 liter of warm water for 2 hours.

14
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,075
2 HOURS AFTER.

15
00:02:09,698 --> 00:02:15,408
put it all in a blender.

16
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:32,570
Add 1 ripe chili to add vitamins and potassium.

17
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:57,032
puree.

18
00:03:04,022 --> 00:03:19,134
filter out residue.

19
00:03:21,953 --> 00:03:33,925
Add water to get 3 liters of liquid fertilizer made from corn kernels.

20
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:45,175
Add 30ml of beer

21
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:56,028
We now have synthetic fertilizers from ingredients including corn, peppers and beer.

22
00:03:59,275 --> 00:04:05,382
Use:

23
00:04:19,023 --> 00:04:31,214
Spray on leaves and roots once every 2 weeks.

24
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:49,734
Helps to supplement nutrition through leaves very well.

25
00:04:53,372 --> 00:05:04,046
it is a great organic foliar fertilizer.

26
00:05:10,234 --> 00:05:21,199
After applying this method for 2 weeks you will see green orchids.

27
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:32,458
At this time, you need to take care of the roots for the plant to grow.

28
00:05:33,206 --> 00:05:43,505
you water this liquid fertilizer at the root.

29
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:56,314
Corn contains many nutrients such as potassium (potassium), phosphorus (phosphorus), nitrogen (nitrogen),

30
00:05:57,514 --> 00:06:07,893
and important minerals, helping to provide adequate nutrients for orchids.

31
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:19,678
Corn kernels help stimulate the growth of orchid roots,

32
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:30,806
helping them to absorb water and nutrients from the soil.

33
00:06:32,118 --> 00:06:41,400
Corn contains gibberellic acid, a natural growth hormone,

34
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:52,538
which helps stimulate orchids to grow quickly and vigorously.

35
00:06:58,516 --> 00:07:01,483
View results.

36
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:11,016
after 3 weeks fertilizing from corn, chili and beer.

37
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:20,447
Orchids grow very well.

38
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:30,338
This helps the orchid to absorb nutrients best.

39
00:07:31,609 --> 00:07:42,230
With this method, even weak orchids can easily take root very quickly.

40
00:07:58,735 --> 00:08:10,967
You can also combine with other organic fertilizers that I have shared so that the fertilizer is evenly distributed.

41
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:25,389
Thanks to the supply of nutrients and growth stimulation from corn,

42
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:34,346
orchids will have a stronger ability to bloom and set fruit,

43
00:08:36,108 --> 00:08:44,070
produce more beautiful flowers and increase fertility.

44
00:08:46,048 --> 00:08:52,963
Orchids can be kept on branches for up to 6 months.

45
00:08:52,963 --> 00:09:00,136
and bloom continuously from batch to batch.
