Welcome to my channel.

00:00:08,899 --> 00:00:18,897
In this video, I share how to make fertilizer to help flower branches continue to revive and bloom after they wither.

Subscribe to the channel so you don't miss any orchid growing tips on my channel.

4
00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:34,894
These are the branches after the flowers have faded.

5
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:46,891
I cut off all the dead flowers and dry branches.

6
00:01:09,887 --> 00:01:18,885
When eating bananas, don't throw away the banana peel.

7
00:01:26,883 --> 00:01:36,881
I take 1-2 banana peels and cut them into thin slices.

8
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:52,878
Or you can also use 1-2 dried banana peels.

9
00:01:59,877 --> 00:02:09,875
Then take 2-3 eggshells and crumble them.

10
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:36,869
Then take 2 liters of water and boil it.

11
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:56,899
Add 3 spoons of rice to this boiling water.

12
00:03:12,905 --> 00:03:22,894
Then add eggshells and banana peels to soak together.

13
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:52,888
Incubate until the water cools.

14
00:03:58,887 --> 00:04:02,886
2 HOURS LATER.

15
00:04:09,884 --> 00:04:19,882
Filter the residue after the water cools.

16
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:42,878
Add 2 liters of water.

17
00:04:48,877 --> 00:04:58,875
Now I use this water to water orchid roots.

18
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:15,871
This will help stimulate root and flower growth.

19
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:32,868
Do it once a week.

20
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:46,898
Soak in this water for about 30 minutes at a time so that the roots can absorb many substances.

21
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:12,893
Now I spray the orchids with this water once a week.

22
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:26,891
Helps supplement nutrients through leaves and increase resistance.

23
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:41,888
This should be done early in the morning, so that by noon the leaves will dry naturally and are less likely to rot.

24
00:06:51,886 --> 00:07:01,884
And spray these branches once a week to help stimulate bud production.

25
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:26,879
After soaking for 30 minutes, take it out.

26
00:07:36,877 --> 00:07:40,876
1 Month Later.

27
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:52,874
From withered branches, many new flower buds have grown.

28
00:08:17,869 --> 00:08:26,900
I continue to water this once a week.

29
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:48,896
And spray the leaves with this water once a week.

30
00:08:58,894 --> 00:09:02,893
AFTER NEXT 1 MONTH.

31
00:09:06,892 --> 00:09:16,890
Orchids bloom many beautiful flowers.

32
00:09:30,304 --> 00:09:40,885
With this simple method we can care for orchids at home and bloom all year round.
