When you water or soak the orchid pot

48
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,720
before fertilizing, the dry roots will

49
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,720
be moistened and awakened, helping them

50
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,440
absorb nutrients from the fertilizer

51
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,840
more easily. If you fertilize while the

52
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,239
roots are still dry, the plant may

53
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,360
experience fertilizer shock, causing

54
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,280
root burn and weakening the orchid.

55
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,159
Pre-watering helps the fertilizer

57
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:12,050
nourish the plant more effectively.

59
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,440
Watering before fertilizing also helps

60
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,519
wash away excess mineral salts and

61
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,920
fertilizer residues left in the growing

62
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,959
medium. This makes the root environment

63
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,400
more ventilated, balances the pH level,

64
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,959
and prevents the roots from being

65
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,120
poisoned by salts. Clean and healthy

66
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,519
roots are the foundation for sustainable

67
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,519
orchid growth.

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,640
When the orchid pot is soaked in water

70
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,519
for about 20 minutes, the roots are

71
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,599
revived after a dry period, helping to

72
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,400
improve air circulation and stimulate

73
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,560
new root growth. This not only makes the

74
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,280
plant healthier, but also keeps the

75
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:03,720
leaves lush and green. And the flowers

76
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,720
bloom beautifully in the next season.

77
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,319
While waiting for the orchid pot to soak

78
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,879
in water, I will prepare natural

79
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,360
fertilizer for the plant. The first

80
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,360
ingredient I use is green tea, a

81
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,440
familiar ingredient that contains many

82
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,680
nutrients beneficial for orchids,

83
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:24,080
helping the plant stay lush, the roots

84
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:27,280
strong, and the flowers last longer.

85
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,759
With just 1 tbsp of green tea and 500 ml

86
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,280
of boiling water, you can make a natural

87
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,970
nutrient solution to nourish your

88
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:42,559
orchid.

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,440
After mixing, cover and let the solution

91
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,120
steep until it completely cools down.

92
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,040
This helps the green tea retain its

93
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,639
maximum nutrients and natural aroma

94
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,000
while preventing the evaporation of

95
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,000
beneficial components for the orchid.

96
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,720
After soaking for about 20 minutes, take

97
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,120
the orchid pot out and let it drain

98
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,280
completely before fertilizing. Allowing

99
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,720
it to drain helps the roots absorb just

100
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,240
the right amount of nutrients,

101
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,840

102
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,840
overfertilization

109
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,880

193
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,040
form a natural protective layer on the

194
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,080
leaves helping the orchid resist

195
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,080
pathogens and pests. Uh this is a gentle

196
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,959
care method that helps the plant remain

197
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,959
healthy and sustainable.

[Music]

199
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,680
Spraying the solution directly onto the

200
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,079
plant saves time compared to wiping each

201
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,320
leaf, especially for large orchid pots

202
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,399
or those with many leaves. At the same

203
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,480
time, this method helps nutrients

204
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,640
quickly penetrate the plant, nourishing

205
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,959
the orchid effectively from leaves down

206
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,959
to the roots.

207
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,680
Method three, pour this fertilizer

208
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,000
mixture directly onto the orchid's roots

209
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,480
and growing medium. This method allows

210
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,399
the roots to absorb nutrients directly,

211
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,640
nourishing the plant from the base up

212
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:58,360
and promotes healthy growth of leaves,

213
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,360
roots, and flowers.

214
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,680
Watering the fertilizer mixture of green

215
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,519
tea and yogurt directly onto the roots

216
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,760
helps nutrients quickly penetrate the

217
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,000
root system, providing energy for

218
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,000
healthy plant growth.

219
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,160
Strong roots support better water and

220
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,279
nutrient absorption, thereby promoting

221
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,279
the overall development of the orchid.

222
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,519
This mixture also helps improve the

223
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,680
quality of the growing medium by adding

224
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,920
beneficial microorganisms from yogurt

225
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,240
and compounds from green tea, keeping

226
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,920
the medium loose, well moisturized, and

227
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,120
ventilated, creating an ideal

228
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,120
environment for orchid roots.

229
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,760
The nutrients in the mixture not only

230
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,160
nourish the existing roots, but also

231
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,160
stimulate the growth of new roots,

232
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,959
helping the orchid expand its root

233
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,839
system, increase its ability to absorb

234
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,839
nutrients and water, and simultaneously

235
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:01,320
promote new shoots and the development

236
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,320
of young leaves.

237
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,839
After watering, you can soak the orchid

238
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,000
pot in the mixture for about 20 minutes.

239
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,240
This helps the roots absorb nutrients to

240
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,639
the maximum, supports more effective

241
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,740
uptake, and enhances the vitality of the

242
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:21,440
entire orchid.

[Music]

244
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,079
After soaking the orchid pot for 20

245
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,880
minutes, take the pot out and place it

246
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,440
in a spot with gentle sunlight to allow

247
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,680
the orchid to photosynthesize. Gentle

248
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,519
light helps the leaves absorb energy,

249
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,000
synthesize nutrients from the applied

250
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:42,399
fertilizer, and simultaneously promotes

251
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
flowering and healthy plant growth.

252
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,399
Remember, no matter how good the

253
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,800
fertilizer is, if the plant lacks light,

254
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,040
photosynthesis will be inefficient and

255
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,440
the orchid will have difficulty

256
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,360
blooming. Light is an essential factor

257
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,839
that helps the plant convert nutrients

258
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,600
into energy, nourishing healthy roots,

259
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,669
leaves, and flowers.

261
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,600
When caring for orchids with natural

262
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,560
fertilizer, at first the plant may not

263
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,320
show immediate growth, but after the

264
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,920
roots and leaves have absorbed the

265
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,959
nutrients, you will see the leaves

266
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,720
become lush, firm, and healthy. A sign

267
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,399
that the orchid is absorbing nutrients

268
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,190
well and preparing for a vibrant

269
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:29,750
flowering stage.

Both the new and old roots of the orchid

273
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,399
will grow strongly, anchoring firmly

274
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,399
into the growing medium and pot. Healthy

275
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,240
roots help the plant stay stable,

276
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,959
increase its ability to absorb water and

277
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,720
nutrients, and simultaneously provide a

278
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:58,360
solid foundation for lush leaf growth

279
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,360
and vibrant flowering.

281
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,079
Additionally, strong root growth also

282
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,639
promotes the emergence of new shoots and

283
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,880
flower buds, helping the orchid remain

284
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,360
lush and bloom regularly in the

285
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,360
following seasons.

286
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,480
When the orchid is properly cared for,

287
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:37,519
the flower buds will be plump and full.

288
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,160
These healthy buds usually bloom evenly,

289
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,600
last long, and produce vibrant flowers,

290
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,440
indicating that the plant is growing

291
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,820
well from roots to leaves and we're

292
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,919

soft, and vibrant, showing that the

296
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,279
orchid is being nourished healthily from

297
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,279
roots to leaves. Beautiful flowers not

298
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,360
only enhance aesthetic value but also

299
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:11,320
serve as evidence of proper care and

300
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,320
balanced natural nutrition.
