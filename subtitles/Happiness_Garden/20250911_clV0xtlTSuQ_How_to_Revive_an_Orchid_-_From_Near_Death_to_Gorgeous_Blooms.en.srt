Welcome to the happiness garden. Um, in

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,560
today's video, I will guide you on how

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,400
to revive an orchid from being nearly

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,040
dead to blooming with stunning,

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,880
beautiful flowers.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,480
You can see that this orchid is rotting,

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,799
its leaves are wilting, and the plant is

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,799
nearly dying.

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,199
If not treated in time, the condition

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,640
will continue to spread and the plant

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,199
may die.

[Music]

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,119
First, you need to remove all the

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,119
damaged leaves. This helps the plant

15
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:35,399
focus its energy on the healthy parts

16
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,399
and prevents the rot from spreading.

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,320

have you along for the journey.

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,320
Next, you need to carefully check the

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,320
roots of the plant.

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,799
You can see that many roots are hollow

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,799
and rotting.

30
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,200
Next, you cut off all the damaged roots.

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,960
This helps the plant prevent the rot

32
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,520
from spreading and focus on developing

33
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,520
the healthy roots.

Then you cut off the damaged parts of

38
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,799
the stem. This helps the plant prevent

39
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,560
diseases from spreading and focus its

40
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,560

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,920
Next, you rinse the plant under running

43
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,760
water. This helps remove dirt and

44
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,480
bacteria, creating the best conditions

45
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,480
for the plant to recover.

46
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,959
Next, you take about 4 cups of water,

47
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,720
equivalent to 1.2 L, to prepare a

48
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,700
disinfecting solution for the plant and

49
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:22,159
the substrate before planting.

Then take half a lemon and squeeze out

52
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,599
the juice to mix into the disinfecting

53
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,599
solution for the plant and substrate.

and many minerals which help disinfect,

57
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,050
provide nutrients, and protect the plant

58
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:54,949
from bacteria.

After mixing, pour this water and soak

62
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,519
the orchid for about 20 minutes. This

63
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:13,040
helps disinfect, remove bacteria, and

64
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:21,919
prepare the plant for replanting.

66
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,160
Next, we will prepare natural fertilizer

67
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,800
to care for the orchid.

68
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,800
To make the fertilizer, I use rice. Rice

69
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,080
contains a lot of starch, protein, and

70
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,919
minerals, which help nourish the

71
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,759
orchid's roots and leaves, and also

72
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,120
support the plant's recovery after a

73
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,120
period of weakness.

74
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,960
Take three teaspoons of rice and mix

75
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,210
with four cups of water, equivalent to

76
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:55,810
about one liter.

78
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,280
And here is the GE banana that I

79
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,040
fermented beforehand, which helps

80
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,040
provide natural nutrients for the

81
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,040
orchid.

83
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:23,240
Take 50 mm equivalent to a little over 3

84
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,240

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,039

89
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:01,000
After soaking for 20 minutes, take the

90
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,000
plant out to drain before replanting.

91
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,800
Then you can use this disinfecting

92
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,039
solution to soak the pine bark. This

93
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,639
helps clean the substrate and remove

94
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,639
bacteria before using it to plant the

95
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,639
orchid.

96
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,240
Soak the pine bark for 20 minutes. Uh

97
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,910
this helps remove bacteria and

98
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,560
impurities.

After soaking for 20 minutes, take out

101
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,120
the pine bark and let it drain before

102
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,120
planting the orchid.

103
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,280
After the pine bark and orchid have

104
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,919
drained, we proceed to plant the orchid

105
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,840
in a new pot. Using a new pot helps the

106
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,840
plant grow better, avoids leftover

107
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,330
bacteria, and provides space for healthy

108
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,740
root development.

of the pot, then plant the orchid on

112
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,960
top. This helps with good drainage,

113
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,220
prevents root rot, and creates an ideal

114
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:44,199

When inserting the pine bark, gently

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,319
arrange it evenly around the roots. This

119
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,240
helps stabilize the plant, ensures good

120
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:02,280

After inserting the pine bark, gently

123
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,360
tap the sides of the pot to secure the

124
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,440
substrate. This helps the plant stand

125
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,199
firmly and allows the roots to have good

126
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,199
contact with the substrate, supporting

127
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,199

128
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,680
After planting, sprinkle a little moss

129
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,200
on the surface of the pot. This helps

130
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,880
retain moisture, creates a cool

136
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,080
roots have stabilized, you can start

137
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,600
applying natural fertilizer so the plant

138
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,600

192
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,279
I gently peel off the protective layer

193
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,839
on the dormant node to help stimulate

194
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,760
the sprouting process. This allows the

195
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,399
bud to have better contact with air and

196
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,760
nutrients, helping it grow faster and

197
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:26,959
stronger.

198
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:29,200
[Music]

199
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,880
Then place the orchid pot in a spot with

200
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,120
gentle sunlight so the orchid can

201
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,560
photosynthesize.

202
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,560
In addition to applying natural

203
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,639
fertilizer, you need to regularly check

204
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,920
the moisture of the substrate. When you

205
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:44,399
see it is dry, gently mist with water to

206
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:48,680
keep it moist. Then patiently wait for

207
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,680
the orchid to recover and grow again.

208
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,760
And here is the result after 2 months of

209
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,920
recovery care. You can see that from the

210
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,320
dormant node on the mother plant's stem,

211
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,639
a healthy, vibrant baby orchid has now

212
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,959
grown. A testament to patience and

213
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,959
proper care.

214
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,560
From the leaves to the roots, the baby

215
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,000
orchid is growing very healthily,

216
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,680
showing that it is absorbing enough

217
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,680
nutrients and has an ideal living

218
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,680
environment.

219
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,760
Uh the roots of the mother orchid are

220
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,240
also growing vigorously which helps the

221
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,480
plant absorb water and nutrients better

222
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,120
to nourish the baby orchid so it grows

223
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,120
quickly and healthily.

[Music]

225
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,000
I continue to fertilize this orchid with

226
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,720
natural fertilizer made from rice water

227
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,639
and GE banana two to three times a

228
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,199
month. This helps the plant receive

229
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:13,959
nutrients regularly, stay healthy, grow

230
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,959

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,040
the plant photosynthesize effectively,

an orchid that was nearly dead, it has

259
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,079
now revived strongly and is blooming

260
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,160
