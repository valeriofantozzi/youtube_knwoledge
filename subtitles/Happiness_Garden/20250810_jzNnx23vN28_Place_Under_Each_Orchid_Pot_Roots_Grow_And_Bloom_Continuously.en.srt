Never underestimate natural fertilizers.

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,920
They deliver effects similar to

200
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:10,000
synthetic mineral compounds, but are

201
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,140
safer for the plants and the surrounding

202
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,220

After soaking for 20 minutes, gently

210
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,480
take the orchid pot out of the mixture

211
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,320
to continue normal care.

212
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,639
After fertilizing the plant, I place the

213
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,839
orchid in a spot with gentle sunlight to

214
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,920
help it photosynthesize effectively.

215
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,600
No matter how good the fertilizer is,

216
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,760
without enough light, the orchid will

217
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,760
grow slowly and won't reach its optimal

218
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,760
health.

219
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,560
And here's the result. After 3 weeks of

220
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,560
care with this natural fertilizer,

221
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,959
you can easily see the strong growth of

222
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,440
healthy new roots, which proves that the

223
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:45,399
care method and natural fertilizer are

224
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,399

250

Maintain the temperature for the orchid

251
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,920
at around 20 to 25° C during the day and

252
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,680
15 to 18° C at night. This temperature

253
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,360
difference helps stimulate the orchid to

254
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,880
