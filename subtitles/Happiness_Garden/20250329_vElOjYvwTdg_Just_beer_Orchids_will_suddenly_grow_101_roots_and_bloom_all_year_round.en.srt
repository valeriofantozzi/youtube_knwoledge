5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,240
restore an orchid suffering from leaf

00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,240
rot so that it can recover and grow

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,960
quickly. If you haven't subscribed to my

00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,119
channel. So, let's get started.

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,160
You can see that this orchid which was

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,840
growing healthily suddenly has some

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,840
rotting leaves in the middle of its

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,480
stem. When you encounter an orchid with

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,559
with this type of rot, the first thing

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,000
you need to do is isolate it from the

18
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,800
garden to prevent the disease from

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,800
spreading to other

20
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,039
plants. The cause of this leaf rot in

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,879
the orchid is bacteria which leads to

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,879
orchid soft rot disease.

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,620
In just a few hours, they can make the

24
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,879
orchid leaves become soft, mushy, and

25
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:06,320
[Music]

26
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:08,640
necrotic. If not treated quickly, the

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,720
rot will spread to other leaves, down

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,000
the stem, and to the roots, causing the

29
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,439
orchid to die

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,439
rapidly. After isolating it from the

31
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,990
garden, we proceed to clean up and

32
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:25,520
remove the rotten parts from the orchid.

34
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,560
At the same time, I trim off all dry

35
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,320
branches and roots. Um, this helps the

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,320
orchid focus its nutrients on the

37
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,799
healthy parts and stimulates stronger

new root

00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:47,600
growth. At the same time, removing the

40
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,439
withered parts also helps the plant stay

41
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,799
well ventilated, reducing the risk of

42
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,799

This is cinnamon powder. Cinnamon has

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,040
strong antibacterial and antifungal

59
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,920

If not filtered properly, cinnamon

75
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,600
powder can stick to the leaves and

76
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,080
roots, hindering the plant's respiration

77
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,960

78
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,960
promotes fungal growth.

79
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,759
Additionally, well-filtered cinnamon

80
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,560
water allows the solution to penetrate

81
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,800

85
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,479
the cinnamon water mixture and gently

86
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,800
wipe both the upper and lower surfaces

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,800

88
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,479
Cinnamon water helps eliminate bacteria

harmful insects such as aphids and

94
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,150

106
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,160
wipe the leaves once a month to prevent

107
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,479

If you encounter any difficulties while

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,280
growing orchids, don't hesitate to leave

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,919

127
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:59,039

128
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,599
onto the rotting area to clean it. This

129
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,680
helps the wound dry faster and reduces

130
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:06,319
the humid environment where bacteria and

131
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,319

132
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:14,639

133
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,039
and dried, the plant will recover more

134
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,919
easily, develop healthy new tissue, and

135
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,919
stimulate tissue

136
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:27,120
regeneration. Then spray it on the

137
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,440
orchid leaves. This helps clean them and

138
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,960
support photosynthesis by removing dust,

139
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,919
allowing the plant to absorb light

properties of cinnamon water help

143
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,560

Step four, water the orchid pot with the

196
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,280
cinnamon and beer mixture to help the

197
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:05,490
orchid recover faster and grow

200
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,560
the mixture around the base of the

201
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,399
plant, avoiding direct contact with the

202
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,399
leaves and crown to prevent water

203
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,399

Water in the morning or late afternoon

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:42,200
nutrients from beer, stimulating root

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,200
growth and aiding in faster recovery.

213
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,480
This mixture also improves the growing

214
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,560
medium by introducing beneficial

215
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:54,000
microorganisms from beer, helping the

216
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,000
plant absorb nutrients more

217
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,480
effectively. After watering, let the

218
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,839
roots soak in this mixture for about 20

219
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,839

pot out and place it in a well

223
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,480
ventilated area with gentle sunlight to

224
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,650
enhance photosynthesis and boost

Now, let's take a look at the results

228
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,760
after 3 weeks of caring for and

229
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,760
restoring the rotting

230
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:40,079
orchid. You can see that new roots have

231
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,040
started to grow from the previously

232
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,959
rotting area. This is a wonderful sign

233
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,680
that the orchid has recovered and is

234
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,680
continuing to thrive.

235
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,440
You can also see that the leaves are

236
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,040
greener and firmer, which proves that

237
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,360
the plant has absorbed enough nutrients

238
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:17,460
and regained its vitality.

And here is another orchid that I also

242
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,600
restored using this method. As you can

243
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:42,120
see, from the roots to the leaves, it is

244
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,120
thriving after the recovery phase.

The growing medium is dry and well

248
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,920
ventilated with no unusual odors. This

249
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,680
indicates that the environment has

250
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,680
improved, reducing the risk of fungal

251
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,680

restored using this method 3 months ago.

Now look at its roots. So strong and

257
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,079
healthy,

258
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:27,040
right? With this simple method, you can

259
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,040
easily restore rotten orchids at home.

260
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,040
Right. With a little patience and the

261
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,920
right approach, your orchid will quickly

262
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:39,519
recover, grow new roots, turn lush green

263
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,519
again, and may even bloom

264
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,839
soon. Keep caring for and loving your

265
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:50,560

266
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:52,160
