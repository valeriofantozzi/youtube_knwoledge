00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,359
nurture your plants. With these methods,

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,760
your orchids will bloom all year round

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,520
with large petals and vibrant colors.

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,600
while the plants will also grow strongly

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,240
with many new roots, firm leaves and

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:29,400
stems, and a lush green appearance full

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,400

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,719
Let's get started.

19
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,960
To make this type of fertilizer, I will

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,039
use lemon. Lemon is very rich in

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,120
vitamins and minerals, so I always

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,520
choose it when caring for orchids,

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,600
helping the plants grow healthy with

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,600
lush green leaves and blooms all year

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,600

32
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,439
I will take the peel of a lemon and cut

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,200
it into small slices.

34
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,920
Lemon peel contains many important

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,240
nutrients such as vitamin C, potassium,

36
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,360
and calcium, helping orchids grow

37
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,360
healthy and boost their resistance.

49
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,599
Then I put the lemon peel into a clean

50
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,360
jar and pour in about 4 cups of room

51
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,640
temperature water, equivalent to about

52
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,560
one liter. This is an important step to

53
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,640
extract the nutrients from the lemon

54
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,640
peel, helping the natural fertilizer

55
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,480
work at its maximum effectiveness for

56
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,879
the orchids.

57
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,040
After pouring the water, I seal the jar

58
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,560
tightly and let it sit for 2 hours so

59
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,599
the nutrients from the lemon peel can

60
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,440
fully infuse into the water.

61
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:47,160
This is my lovely companion. How about

64
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,239
Two hours later, I gently stir the jar

65
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,800
to fully dissolve the valuable nutrients

66
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,370
from the lemon peel, creating a solution

67
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:12,059
rich in vitamins and minerals.

prepare for the next step. Ready to

72
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,520
create a nutrient-rich natural

75
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,200
Next, we will use baking soda. I will

76
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,760
take one spoon of baking soda and mix it

77
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,680
with the strained lemon peel solution,

78
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,200
creating a nutrient-rich mixture for the

79
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,440
orchids.

80
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,200
Baking soda is a wonderful ingredient

81
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,720
providing many benefits when caring for

82
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,280
orchids, helping the plants stay

83
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:59,480
healthy, preventing fungal diseases, and

84
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,200
supporting long-lasting blooms.

86
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,120
Then I add about four cups of water,

87
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,000
equivalent to about one liter, to the

88
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,840
baking soda and lemon water mixture, uh,

89
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,920
creating a nutrient-rich natural

regularly monitor the roots. Uh when you

95
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,400
see the roots turn white and the medium

96
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,919

97
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,000
keep the orchids healthy and growing

Now, I will evenly water this mixture

101
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,000
onto each orchid pot, helping the plants

102
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,560
absorb all the nutrients, grow healthy,

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,560

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,759
the leaves, stems, and growing medium of

152
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,800
the orchids. This helps the plants

153
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,639
absorb nutrients quickly while also

154
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,479
protecting them from fungal diseases and

155
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,479
keeping the leaves glossy and healthy.

and keep the orchids healthy.

162
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,319
Spraying this mixture helps balance the

pH on the surface of the leaves and

164
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,240
growing medium, creating a favorable

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,560
environment for the roots to absorb

168
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,960
When spraying this mixture onto the

169
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,960
leaves and flowers, the orchids can

170
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,280
directly absorb the vitamins and

171
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,080
minerals from the lemon peel and baking

172
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,080
soda. This helps the leaves stay glossy,

173
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,720
the flowers last longer, and the petals

174
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,720
become more vibrant.

175
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,919
Um, regularly spraying this mixture

176
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,639
helps the orchids increase their

177
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:31,199
resistance, reduce the risk of root rot,

178
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,200
leaf wilting, or common diseases,

179
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:37,159
keeping the plants full of vitality and

180
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,159
ready to bloom consistently.

181
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,519
I spray this mixture about one to two

182
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,080
times a month, which helps the plants

183
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:47,200
absorb enough nutrients while avoiding

184
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,120
making the leaves too wet.

185
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,839
However, you should not spray directly

186
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,160
on the flowers. When the flowers get

187
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,240
wet, the petals will wilt and fall

188
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:00,680
quickly, reducing the blooming time and

189
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,680
the beauty of the orchid pot.

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,040
the solution and gently wipe both the

193
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,120
top and underside of the leaves.

194
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,240
You may notice some black spots on the

195
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,080
leaves, which are mold. When orchids are

196
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,080
planted densely, they are prone to black

197
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,839
mold. Wiping the leaves with this

198
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,160
mixture a few times will gradually

199
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,480
reduce and eventually completely remove

200
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,480
the mold, keeping the leaves clean and

201
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,480
healthy.

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,000
In addition, this method also helps

205
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,480
quickly remove white powdery spots on

206
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,240
the leaves. At the same time, wiping the

207
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,160
leaves with the mixture also removes

208
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,160
dust, creating conditions for the plant

209
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,560
to photosynthesize more effectively,

210
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,880
keeping the orchids green, healthy, and

211
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,880
growing well.

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,920
their resistance, grow healthy with

215
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,950
lush, firm leaves ready to withstand

216
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:31,600
harmful agents.

The black mold spots on the leaves will

219
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,399
not disappear immediately, but after a

220
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,480
few applications of this method, they

221
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,640
will gradually disappear completely,

222
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,800
restoring clean and healthy leaves for

223
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,800
the orchids.

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,600
The the essential oils from lemon peel

225
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,279
also help repel some types of insects,

226
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,760
protecting the orchids from pests and

227
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,760
keeping the leaves, stems, and flowers

228
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,760
healthy.

229
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,240
Uh the compounds in lemon peel have

230
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,560
antibacterial and antifungal properties,

231
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,399
helping protect orchids from diseases,

lemon and baking soda mixture not only

237
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,160
provides nutrients, but also prevents

238
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,079
fungal diseases, helping the orchids

239
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,560
grow comprehensively from roots to

240
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,560

241
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,480
With this care method, you will see the

242
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,120
orchids grow healthy, produce many

243
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,519

Do not underestimate natural

248
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,320
fertilizers. They are as effective as

249
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,040
synthetic mineral fertilizers, but safer

250
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,800
for the plants and the environment.

251
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,240
Initially, the plants may grow more

252
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,720
slowly compared to inorganic

253
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,399
fertilizers, but once the nutrients are

254
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,560
fully absorbed, they will grow

255
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,560
sustainably healthy and longlasting.

256
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,440
Do this one to two times a month to help

257
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,480
protect the orchids, keeping them

258
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,480

On my channel, I share many great ways

260
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,880
for you to make natural fertilizers

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,120
After soaking for about 20 minutes,

267
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,360
gently lift the orchid pot out and place

268
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,680
it in a spot with diffused light so the

269
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,720
plant can continue photosynthesizing and

270
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,720
recover in the best way.

271
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,720
Uh remember that no matter how well you

272
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,560
fertilize, if the orchids do not receive

273
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,200
enough light, they will still be

274
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,440
stunted, have yellowing leaves, and

275
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,800
struggle to bloom. Light is the key

276
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,880
factor that helps the plants

277
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,720
photosynthesize and grow healthy.

278
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,040
Sunlight helps orchids carry out

279
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,800
photosynthesis, thereby converting the

280
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,760
nutrients in the fertilizer into the

281
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,240
energy needed for the plant's growth.

282
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,160
Thanks to light, the plant can absorb

283
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,080
and use the nutrients we provide to the

284
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,440
fullest.
