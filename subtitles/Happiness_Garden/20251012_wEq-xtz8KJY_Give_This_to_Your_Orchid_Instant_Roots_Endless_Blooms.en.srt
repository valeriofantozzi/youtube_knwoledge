00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,760
Welcome to the garden of happiness,

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,960
where every leaf and every petal is

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,480
cared for with love and patience. To

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,320
give you more options for natural

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,320
fertilizers, today I will share a

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,559
special formula that helps orchids stay

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,720
healthy. Even the weakest ones can

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,840
revive, grow strong, and bloom

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,840
beautifully all year round.

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,400
Let's get started and discover the

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,599
secret to nurturing the natural beauty

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,599
of your orchids in your little garden.

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,279
You can see that this orchid is having a

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,399
problem. Its leaves are turning yellow

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,160
and showing signs of rot.

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,160
This is a common condition that happens

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,640
when the plant is overwatered, lacks

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,760
sunlight, or has weak roots that can no

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,760
longer absorb enough nutrients.

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,039
Rotten, soft, and watery leaves like

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,840
these actually contain a lot of harmful

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,320
bacteria. If left for too long, they can

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,559
spread to the healthy parts of the plant

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,960
and make the condition even worse.

25
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,120
Therefore, removing them as soon as

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,600
possible is the first important step to

27
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,600
protect your orchid.

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,760
Uh please comment and and let me know

29
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,840

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,880
wonderful that we can connect and chat

31
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,880
from all around the world.

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,040
And if you haven't subscribed yet,

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,759
please hit the subscribe button to

35
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,759
care tips. It's wonderful to have you

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,759
with me.

37
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,600
Then we gently check the entire root

38
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,320
system of the plant. Roots that are

39
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,960
rotten, soft, or have an unpleasant

40
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,799
smell need to be cut off immediately as

41
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,840
they can no longer absorb water and

42
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,840
nutrients for the plant.

43
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,959
You can see that many roots are damaged,

44
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,800
turning brown and mushy. So, we need to

45
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,879
handle the plant very gently when taking

46
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,200
it out of the pot to avoid injuring the

47
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,200
healthy roots.

48
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,959
This step will help us easily inspect

49
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,959
the entire root system and take timely

50
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,519
action before the disease spreads

51
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,519
throughout the plant.

52
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,760
In addition to English dubbing, we have

53
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,400
now created versions in Polish, Bangla,

54
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,799
Portuguese, Hebrew, Hindi, Dutch,

55
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,799
Korean, Indonesian, Italian, Malayalam,

56
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,880
Japanese, French, Punjabi, Tamil,

57
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,639
Telugu, Spanish, German, and Arabic to

58
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,040
help you listen to and understand the

59
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,040
content easily.

60
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,120
To listen in your preferred language,

61
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,840
open the video and click on settings,

62
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,000
the gear icon to select the appropriate

63
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,000
all language.

64
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,280
After removing the damaged leaves and

65
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,840
roots, the next step is to prepare for

66
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,240
disinfecting and stimulating root growth

67
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,240
for the orchid.

68
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,400
To make the disinfecting and root

69
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,319
stimulating solution, start by preparing

70
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,319
5 L of clean water in a container.

71
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,319
Next, take a fresh aloe leaf and

72
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,400
carefully cut it into small pieces. The

73
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,240
aloe will release natural nutrients when

74
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,880
mixed into the water, helping to fight

75
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,440
bacteria and stimulate strong root

76
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,440
growth for the orchid.

77
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,199
These aloe pieces will blend into the

78
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,280
solution, creating a safe and effective

79
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,280
mixture to nourish the orchid after

80
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,280
pruning.

81
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:45,199
Next, we will add the banana enzyme gel

82
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,360
that I have prepared earlier. Take about

83
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,919
100 milllers of banana gel and mix it

84
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,319
into the water solution with the aloe.

85
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,680
The banana gel is rich in nutrients and

86
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,840
natural enzymes which will help the

87
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,599
orchid roots recover faster and

88
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,160
stimulate healthy growth of leaves and

89
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,160
new flower buds.

90
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,919
And finally, we add vitamin B1 to boost

91
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,919
the vitality of the roots.

92
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,440
Add six vitamin B1 tablets, each 2.5 mg,

93
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,360
into the solution and stir well to

94
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,279
dissolve completely.

95
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,120
Vitamin B1 helps the orchid roots

96
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,279
recover quickly, absorb nutrients

97
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,200
better, and prepare the plant for lush

98
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,200
green leaves and vibrant new flower

99
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,200
buds.

100
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,600
Place the freshly cut aloe slices on a

101
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,080
clean cloth and gently press to extract

102
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,880
the gel into the water. This aloe gel

103
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,640
will dissolve evenly in the solution,

104
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,640
carrying natural nutrients that help

105
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,120
fight bacteria and stimulate strong root

106
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,120
growth for the orchid.

107
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,279
In this way, we maximize the benefits of

108
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,800
aloe, creating an ideal environment for

109
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,800
the plant to recover and bloom

110
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,800
beautifully.

111
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,760
Then pour the entire solution into a

112
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,320
container and soak the orchid roots for

113
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,320
about 20 minutes.

114
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,519
This time is enough for the roots to

115
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,240
absorb nutrients from the aloe, banana

116
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,560
gel, and vitamin B1 while being gently

117
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,519
disinfected to eliminate any remaining

118
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,440
bacteria. By the end, you will see the

119
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:37,720
roots looking fresh and smooth, ready to

120
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,720
be replanted and grow healthily.

121
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,240
Um, use the remaining aloe pulp in the

122
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:02,760
cloth to gently wipe both the top and

123
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,760
bottom surfaces of the orchid leaves.

124
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,279
This helps remove dust, bacteria, and

125
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,440
excess residue on the leaves while

126
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:12,000
creating a clean environment for the

127
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,240
leaves to absorb light and nutrients

128
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,240
more effectively.

129
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,480
After wiping, the leaves will be fresh

130
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:52,200
and smooth, ready for the orchid's

131
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,200
healthy growth process.

132
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,000
After soaking the roots and cleaning the

133
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:21,120
leaves, the next step is to prepare the

134
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,160
growing medium to replant the orchid. We

135
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,639
will mix 80% pine bark and 20% moss,

136
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,200
creating an airy environment that

137
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:33,000
retains moderate moisture and is rich in

138
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,000
nutrients for root development.

139
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,639
This growing medium will help the plant

140
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,160
anchor firmly, absorb water and

141
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,399
nutrients efficiently, and provide a

142
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:50,839
solid foundation for lush green leaves

143
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,839
and vibrant blooms in the future.

144
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,240
After soaking the roots in the solution

145
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,760
for about 20 minutes, we replant the

146
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,079
orchid into a new pot. I choose a pot

147
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,240
with drainage holes at the bottom to

148
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,160
ensure the roots do not become water

149
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,480
logged and the plant always receives

150
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,480
enough oxygen.

151
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,639
Planting in a suitable pot with a loose

152
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,800
growing medium will help the roots

153
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,519
anchor firmly, absorb water and

154
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:36,200
nutrients better, and lay the foundation

155
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,200
for healthy growth and vibrant blooms.

156
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,600
When filling the growing medium around

157
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,399
the roots, gently arrange each piece of

158
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:56,360
pine bark and moss evenly, being careful

159
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,360
not to crush the young roots.

160
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,519
After planting, place the orchid pot in

161
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:24,320
a cool, airy spot for about a week and

162
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,160
do not water it. This period allows the

163
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,320
newly cut roots and young parts of the

164
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,839
plant to stabilize while reducing the

165
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,839
risk of rot from early water exposure.

166
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,760
After about a week, when the roots and

167
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:49,320
plant have stabilized, we proceed to

168
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,320
fertilize the orchid.

169
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:56,240
Add 3 teaspoon of rice into a clean

170
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,000
container. Uh the rice will serve as a

171
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,079
natural source of nutrients rich in

172
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,519
starch, helping to stimulate the growth

173
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:05,680
of roots and new shoots on the orchid.

174
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:09,320
Next, add the rice to one liter of water

175
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,320
and stir well.

176
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,839
Then cover the container and let it sit

177
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,160
for about 30 minutes so that the starch

178
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:26,680
in the rice fully dissolves, creating a

179
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,680
nutrient-rich solution for the orchid.

180
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,399
After soaking for 30 minutes, stir the

181
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:38,199
solution once more and strain out any

182
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,199
remaining rice residue.

183
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,800
This makes the solution smooth and

184
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,639
easier for the orchid roots to absorb

185
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,360
while preventing blockage in the growing

186
00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:00,160
medium or pot. In this way, the natural

187
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,079
rice fertilizer will work at its best,

188
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:07,000
nourishing the plant to be healthy with

189
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:07,000
lush green leaves and vibrant blooms.

190
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,160
Step one, use a soft cloth to soak up

191
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,000
the solution and gently wipe both the

192
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,480
top and bottom surfaces of the orchid

193
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,040
leaves. This helps remove dust,

194
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,639
bacteria, and excess residue while

195
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,639
providing nutrients directly to the

196
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,639
leaves.

197
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,360
After wiping the leaves will become

198
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:59,639
clean and smooth. ready to absorb light

199
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,639
and nutrients for healthy growth.

200
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,679
Uh, step two, use the prepared solution

201
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,240
to water directly onto the orchid's

202
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,400
roots and growing medium. This helps the

203
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,120
roots absorb nutrients from the rice,

204
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,799
aloe, and vitamin B1 while also

205
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,799
nourishing the entire surrounding

206
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,799
medium.

207
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,319
The natural nutrients from rice, aloe,

208
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,640
and vitamin B1 not only nourish the

209
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,799
roots, but also create a favorable

210
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,640
environment for new shoots to form,

211
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:36,520
helping the plant grow quickly and bloom

212
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,520
more evenly and vibrantly.

213
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,320
You should apply this mixture twice a

214
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,799
month. Regular maintenance helps the

215
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,440
orchid roots stay healthy, the leaves

216
00:17:54,799 --> 00:18:00,000
remain lush, and the flower buds develop

217
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,440
consistently. When applied consistently,

218
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,520
the orchid will have long-lasting

219
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,880
vitality, ready to bloom beautifully,

220
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,880
bringing full beauty to your garden.

221
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,080
And here are the results after 2 months

222
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,480
of consistent care. You can see the

223
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,280
roots growing vigorously with many new

224
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,320
roots extending long and firm, signaling

225
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,240
the orchid's abundant vitality.

226
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,880
At the same time, the leaves become

227
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,960
lush, glossy, and full of life. The

228
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,720
vitality of the leaves is the clearest

229
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,880
sign that the roots are absorbing

230
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,200
nutrients effectively and the plant is

231
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,200
growing healthily.

232
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,480
And the special thing is that you can

233
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,280
see the flower buds emerging, proving

234
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,960
that the plant has fully recovered. Now,

235
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,000
the orchid is not only healthy with

236
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,240
strong roots and lush green leaves, but

237
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,400
also ready for the next vibrant blooms,

238
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,400
bringing full beauty to your garden.

239
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,799
It's wonderful to see the orchid revive

240
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,280
and prepare to bloom, like a natural

241
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,280
gift for you.

242
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,640
I continue to care for the orchid by

243
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,280
watering it with the natural rice

244
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,960
fertilizer every 2 weeks. Maintaining

245
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,320
this routine helps the roots stay

246
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,880
healthy, the leaves remain lush, and the

247
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:28,679
flower buds develop evenly, preparing

248
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,679
for vibrant blooms.

249
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,720
In addition, you can alternate with

250
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,919
other natural fertilizers to provide

251
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,919
complete nutrients for the orchid.

252
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,840
This rotation helps the plant receive a

253
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,400
variety of vitamins and minerals,

254
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,320
promoting healthy roots, lush green

255
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,200
leaves, and evenly developing flower

256
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,679
buds. As a result, your orchid will

257
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,919
always be vibrant, bloom beautifully and

258
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:05,960
brilliantly all year round, bringing joy

259
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,960
every time you admire it.

260
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,400
And here are the results after 3 months

261
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,240
of persistent care. You can see that a

262
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,640
plant that once had rotting leaves and

263
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,640
roots has now grown strong and sturdy

264
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,600
with lush green leaves and vibrant

265
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,120
flowers beginning to bloom. It's

266
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,679
wonderful to witness the plant's

267
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:37,720
complete revival, bringing new life and

268
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,720
full beauty to your garden.

269
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,039
This revival process is a testament to

270
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,679
the power of patience and love for

271
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,280
plants. With just simple care steps,

272
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,919
natural solutions, and consistent

273
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,559
attention, you can completely transform

274
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,200
a weak orchid once thought hopeless into

275
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,960
a healthy plant that blooms beautifully.

276
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,520
Believe that with love and dedicated

277
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,000
care, any orchid can revive, bringing

278
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:09,240
joy, beauty, and endless inspiration to

279
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,240
your garden.

280
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,600
Every lush green leaf and every vibrant

281
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,840
bloom is the result of the love and

282
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,840
patience you give to the plant.

283
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,840
Remember, caring for orchids is not just

284
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,799
a task but a journey of connecting with

285
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:32,080
nature, learning patience, and enjoying

286
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:33,679
each small yet precious moment. With a

287
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,919
natural, simple, and consistent

288
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,720
approach, you can completely transform

289
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,960
your garden into a space full of life,

290
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:45,159
where each orchid pot tells a story of

291
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,159
revival and lasting beauty.
