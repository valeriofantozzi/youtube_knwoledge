Coffee grounds when fermented will

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:35,600
become nutrient-rich organic fertilizer.

199
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,800
Fermented coffee grounds contain many

200
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,680
important nutrients for plant growth

201
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,170
such as nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus,

202
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:50,929
calcium, and minerals.

204
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,680
This is a natural source of nutrients

205
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:04,800
that helps orchids grow healthily.

bacteria very effectively.

215
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,680
If you fertilize one to two times twice

216
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,280
a month, the leaves will always be green

217
00:16:47,680 --> 00:17:12,720
and disease-free.

most nutrients through the roots.
