Then soak the rice in a cup of water

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,360
about 300 millimeters for 30 minutes to

32
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:29,420
allow the essence from the rice uh to

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,520
Then soak the rice in a cup of water

36
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,520
about 300 ml and then blend it until

37
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,520
smooth.

38
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,159
After blending, pour the mixture and

39
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,240
strain it through a sie to remove the

40
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,399
residue, keeping only the smooth liquid

41
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,860
ready to be used as fertilizer for

42
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,540

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,959
Next, add 3 tablespoons of GE ginger

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,959
solution to the mixture. GE ginger has

51
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,800
antibacterial properties, helping

52
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,640

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,680
particular, this method helps stimulate

68
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,000
rapid sprouting, bringing fresh vitality

69
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,000

Rice not only provides nutrients but

73
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,519
also helps develop beneficial

74
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,680
microorganisms, creating a natural

75
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,239
protective layer for orchid roots,

78
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,000
Apply this method once a month to

79
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,240
provide full nutrients and boost the

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,690
orchid's resistance, helping the plant

81
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:38,880

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,040
Second method,

84
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,800
you can pour this liquid fertilizer

85
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,639
mixture into a spray bottle, allowing it

86
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,040
to be evenly sprayed onto the leaves and

87
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,360
stems while providing nutrients quickly

88
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,360

[Music]

90
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,560
Spray this fertilizer over the entire

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,240
orchid, including the leaves and stems,

92
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,840
so the plant can absorb nutrients

93
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,840
directly.

94
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,919
This method is similar to using folure

95
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,360
fertilizer, helping the plant grow more

96
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:15,280
balanced and healthier.

97
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,680
When spraying, make sure to cover both

98
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,320
the upper and lower surfaces of the

99
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,639
leaves. The underside of the leaves is

100
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,880
often where insects and bacteria

101
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,639
concentrate their attacks first. So

102
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,840
thorough spraying helps protect the

103
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,759
plant more effectively.

104
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,600
This fertilizer can be used to care for

105
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,560
most types of orchids including

106
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,120
phelinopsis, catala, dendrobium,

107
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,880
simidium, and many other varieties,

108
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,120
helping the plant stay healthy and bloom

109
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,800
beautifully.

110
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,560
You should apply this method one to two

111
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,720
times a month to provide full nutrients

112
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,800
and boost the orchid's resistance,

113
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,039
helping the plant stay healthy and grow

114
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,400
well.

115
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,240
Third method, um, use a cloth to soak up

116
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,400
the fertilizer mixture and gently wipe

117
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,240
both the upper and lower surfaces of the

118
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,240
leaves, allowing nutrients to be

119
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,160
absorbed directly while cleaning the

120
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,320
leaf surface, preventing dust and

121
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,430
bacteria.

[Music]

123
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,720
These are pests that harm orchids.

124
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,479
Wiping the leaves with the fertilizer

125
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,199
mixture helps effectively eliminate

126
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:27,800
insects, protect the plant from threats,

127
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,800
and keep the leaves clean and healthy.

128
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,240
Um, after wiping, the leaf surface will

129
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,479
always be clean and the stamata

130
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,319
unobstructed. This helps orchids

131
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,160
photosynthesize better, absorb light and

132
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:42,199
nutrients effectively, thereby growing

133
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,199
healthy and blooming beautifully.

134
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,440
When this method is applied regularly,

135
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,319
orchid leaves will not only be clean but

136
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,800
also healthy, reducing pests and harmful

137
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,120
insects. At the same time, the plant

138
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,800
will absorb nutrients better, roots will

139
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,759
grow strong, and flowers will bloom

140
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:04,199
evenly and last longer, bringing vibrant

141
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,199
beauty to your orchid growing space.

142
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,360
And here is the result. After one month

143
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,759
of care with natural fertilizer, you

144
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,759
will see the roots develop healthily and

145
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,440
produce many new roots, creating a

146
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,880
strong foundation for the orchid to

147
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,880
absorb nutrients and grow

148
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,880
comprehensively.

149
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,880
These new roots not only help the orchid

150
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,360
anchor firmly to the growing medium, but

151
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,599
also increase its ability to absorb

152
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,440
water and nutrients, thereby supporting

153
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,919
lush green leaves and more vibrant

154
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,919
blooms. When the roots are healthy, the

155
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,840
orchid will grow comprehensively,

156
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:41,319
robustly, and be ready for the next

157
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,319
flowering cycles.

158
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,039
And here is the result after the next

159
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,880
two months.

160
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,479
You can see that the orchid has grown

161
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,639
many new offshoots from the mother

162
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:58,120

day by day.

164
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,160
These offshoots will continue to mature

165
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,759

170
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,560
mother plant but also the offshoots grow

171

172
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,759
strong roots.

173
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,680
Um, this creates a foundation for the

next blooming cycles, bringing a vibrant

175
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,519
and colorful space to your garden.

176
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,839
This not only opens up a new generation

177
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,680
of orchids, but also ensures that the

178
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,839
offshoots will bloom beautifully,

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,640
Each flower maintains its longevity,

194
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,640
blooming for many days, allowing you to

195
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,200
enjoy the fresh beauty of the orchids

196

for a long time.

197
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,080
With regular care, using natural

198
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,440
fertilizer, the orchid not only blooms

199
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,760
beautifully, but also grows

200
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,640
comprehensively from roots, stems, and

201
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:40,600
leaves to flowers, ensuring long lasting

202
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,600
vitality for the plant.

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,040
Thank you for watching until here, and

206
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,720
share useful tips to help you easily

207
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:56,120
propagate felinopsis at home effectively

208
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,120
and quickly.

209
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,440
Welcome to part two of the video. In

210
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,160
this part, I will guide you through

211
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,720
simple yet effective steps to propagate

212
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,959
Phelinopsis at home, helping you expand

213
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,680
your orchid collection without much

214
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:14,079
effort. After the orchid has just

215
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,040
dropped all its petals, this is the best

216
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,200
time to propagate from the flower spike.

217
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,880
At this point, the mother plant has

218
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,720
completed its flowering process and is

219
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,720
ready for a new growth phase, helping

220
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,040
the offshoots grow healthy and

221
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:35,230
effectively.

223
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,920
Then take one clove of garlic and

224
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,760
squeeze out the juice. The garlic juice

225
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,760
will be used as a natural solution to

226
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,160
provide antibacterial protection,

227
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,760
safeguard the flower spike, and support

228
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,630
the orchid propagation process

229
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,519

[Music]

241
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,959
Next, use a cotton swab to dip into the

242
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,200
garlic juice and apply it directly onto

243
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,839
the node that needs stimulation to grow

244
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,680
an orchid offshoot. The garlic juice

245
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,800
will help provide antibacterial

246
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,720
protection, safeguard the spike, and

247
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,720
naturally stimulate the formation of new

248
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,720
shoots.

249
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,760
Only the nodes that have not yet bloomed

250
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,839
can sprout and grow into orchid

251
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,560
offshoots. So, you should apply the

252
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,120
garlic juice only to the young unopened

253
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,959
nodes. This ensures that the new shoots

254
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,420
will grow healthy and easily develop

255
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,870
into offshoots.

[Music]

257
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,920
Then use a transparent plastic wrap to

258
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,399
cover the part of the flower spike where

259
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,800
the node you want to stimulate into an

260
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,200
orchid offshoot is located. This helps

261
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,600
retain moisture, protect the young chute

262
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,360
from insects and bacteria, and create an

263
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,360
ideal environment for the offshoot to

264
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,360
develop.

265
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,920
Make a small hole for ventilation,

266
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,160
allowing the chute to receive enough

267
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,320
oxygen and preventing moisture that can

268
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,160
cause rot or fungus.

269
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,920
uh creating the best conditions for the

270
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:37,020
orchid offshoot to grow.

[Music]

272
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,880
And here's the result after 3 weeks of

273
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,880
care.

274
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:49,299
[Music]

275
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,279
You can see that the spot where the

276
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,000
garlic juice was applied has formed a

277
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:00,079
very healthy orchid offshoot. However,

278
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,959
at this stage, the offshoot has not yet

279
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:05,120
developed visible leaves or roots. This

280
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,440
is an early sign that the new chute is

281
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,530
beginning to grow and is ready for the

282
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:17,279
next stages of development.

283
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:19,519
[Music]

284
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,120
And here's the result after the next 2

285
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,120
months.

286
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,240
You can see that the orchid offshoot has

287
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,240
grown very healthily on the flower spike

288
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,480
with leaves starting to open clearly and

289
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,079
young roots forming.

290
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,000
This is an important step showing that

291
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:38,279
the new chute is ready to develop into

292
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,279
an independent plant in the future.

293
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,720
Note, throughout the process of

294
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,120
stimulating the node to grow into an

295
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,160
orchid offshoot, place the orchid pot in

296
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,160
a shaded area with high humidity as this

297
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,760
helps the young shoot form and develop

298
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,680
easily.

299
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,160
Conversely, if the orchid pot is placed

300
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,160
in a sunny area with low humidity, the

301
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,440
plant is more likely to produce flowers

302
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,880
instead of an offshoot.

303

[Music]

304
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,800
I have also applied this little tip to

305
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,560
another orchid and you can see the

306
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,480
result is that many healthy orchid

307
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,079
offshoots have formed on the flower

308
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,240
spike.

309
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,160
This simple yet effective method helps

310
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,880
propagate phelinopsis easily and

311
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,880
naturally at home.

312
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,720
Be persistent in applying these methods

313
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,800
and gradually you will have a thriving

314
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,519
