00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:16,640
care. In today's video, I'll introduce

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,960
you to a new natural fertilizer, which

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:23,880
not only helps orchids grow strong, but

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,880
also bloom beautifully all year round.

tips to care for

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,160
them, let's get

12
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:43,660

19
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,080
country you are watching the video from.

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,720
It's great that we can chat together

21
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,479
from all over the

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,080
world. Uh as soon as the flowers wilt,

23
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,799
repot your orchid and the plant will

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,799
recover and grow quickly.

25
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,640
Uh, you cut off old flower branches so

26
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,790
that the orchid can focus on nutrition

27
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:33,060
for new flower branches

28
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:33,060

29
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:39,759
later. Then use coffee powder to

30
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,720
sprinkle on the cut to help the wound

31
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,849
heal quickly.

[Music]

33
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,320
Then wait overnight for the cut to heal

34
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,510
completely before proceeding with the

35
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,689

[Music]

37
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:11,319
step. To make this fertilizer, I use

38
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,319
okra.

39
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,200
Okra is an excellent natural ingredient

40
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,060
for making fertilizer for orchids due to

41
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,189
its rich

42
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,189
[Music]

43
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,760
nutrients. Next, I use potatoes as

44
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,760
natural fertilizer to restore the

45
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,760
orchid.

46
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,720
Potatoes are rich in starch providing

47
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,720
essential energy for orchid

48
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,560
growth. Uh potatoes are packed with

49
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:59,040
minerals like potassium, phosphorus and

50
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,720
vitamin B6 which stimulate root

51
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,720
development and promote healthy orchid

52
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,720
growth.

53
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,080
Put the okra and chopped potatoes in the

54
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,080
jar.

55
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,879
Add one liter of

56
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:03,120
water.

57
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:03,120
Close the

58
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:11,519
lid. Wait overnight for the nutrients to

59
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,519
dissolve into the

60
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,320
water. Next, I use oatmeal as a natural

61
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,880
fertilizer. Take 3 tablesp of oatmeal.

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,040
Add one liter of water.

63
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:00,480
[Music]

64
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,629
Wait overnight.

After one

68
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:22,730
night, stir well so that the flour

69
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,779
nutrients dissolve into the

70
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,779
[Music]

71
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,400
water. Filter out residue.

72
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,280
Step

73
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:57,360
one, use a soft cloth to gently wipe the

74
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,360
top and bottom of the orchid leaves with

75
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,360
the okra and potato soaked water

76
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,360
solution.

77
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,160
removes dust and residue, improving the

78
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,160
plant's ability to

79
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,160
photosynthesize. The okra and potato

80
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,560
solution supplies natural nutrients

81
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,560
through the leaves.

82
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,000
Leaves become shinier, softer, and

83
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:50,800
healthier. The solution may form a

84
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:55,639
protective layer, reducing the risk of

85
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,639
pest infestations on orchid leaves.

86
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,680
Gently wipe each leaf, both the upper

87
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,639
and lower surfaces, ensuring the

88
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,639
solution is evenly

89
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:20,599
applied. Do it one or two times per

90
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,599
month for best results.

91
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,080
This method keeps orchids clean,

92
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,080
healthy, and

93
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:40,319
thriving. Step

94
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:48,759
two, put this solution in a spray bottle

95
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,759
and mist the entire orchid plant.

96
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,759
Spraying adds moisture especially in dry

97
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:08,639
conditions. Spraying ensures the

98
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,680
solution covers the entire plant from

99
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,680
roots to stems and leaves.

100
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:21,919
Spraying ensures the solution covers the

101
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,919
entire plant from roots to stems and

102
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:32,240
leaves. Forms a natural protective layer

103
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,240
reducing the risk of pest

104
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:43,240
infestations. Do it one to two times per

105
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,240
month for best results.

106
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:57,360
Step three, after spraying, use a soft

107
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,360
cloth to blot excess water from orchid

108
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,560
leaves. Water pooling on leaves,

109
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,120
especially in crevices, can cause rot if

110
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,120
left too long.

111
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,000
A damp environment can attract fungi and

112
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,000
bacteria harmful to

113
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:31,720
orchids. Protects orchid leaves. Keeps

114
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,720
leaves dry, glossy, and healthy.

115
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,640
This habit keeps your orchids clean,

116
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,959
healthy, and minimizes potential pest or

117
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,959
disease issues.

118
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,720
Step

119
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:16,519
four. Now I mix the oatmeal solution

120
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,519
with the okra and potato solution.

121
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,040
This mix provides amino acids,

122
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,640
polysaccharides, and natural starches to

123
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,640
encourage longer, stronger

124
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:09,079
roots. Then you water the orchid roots

125
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,079
with this mix solution.

126
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,200
The solution stabilizes moisture levels,

127
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,200
enhancing nutrient

128
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,839
[Music]

129
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:36,399
absorption. Made from natural

130
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,720
ingredients, it's safe for orchids and

131
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,720
the environment.

132
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,839
This mixture is a fantastic natural

133
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,880
nutrient source, helping orchids grow

134
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,880
robustly and bloom

135
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:00,079
beautifully. Do it one to two times per

136
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,079
month for best

137
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:06,260
results. And I soaked the orchid root in

138
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,500
this mix solution for 20 minutes.

139
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,500
[Music]

140
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,560
Soaking softens the roots, increasing

141
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,040
their ability to absorb water and

142
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,040
nutrients

143
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,959
[Music]

144
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,040
afterward. After 20 minutes, take it out

145
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,440
and place the orchid pot in a place with

146
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,440
plenty of light.

147
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:35,600
[Music]

148
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,760
Placing the orchid in a well-lit area

149
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,480
helps it dry properly, reducing the risk

150
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,480
of mold or

151
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,120
pests. Light aids the orchid in

152
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,000
photosynthesis, converting nutrients to

153
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,000
promote strong growth.

156
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,720
days, the orchid grows two new flower

157
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,320
branches. Orchid leaves become glossier,

158
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,560
thicker, and healthier with a vibrant

159
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,560
green color.

[Music]

163
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,040
Wow. Orchid roots grow very strongly.

164
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:13,720
This clearly improves and enhances the

165
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,720
ability to absorb nutrients and water.

166
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,040
With strong root and leaf growth, the

167
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,480
orchid will absorb nutrients more

168
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,480
efficiently from the surrounding

169
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,480

170
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:17,000
Now I'm repotting the orchid into a new

171
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,000
pot for better growth.

172
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:25,040
I plant with pine bark to help retain

173
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,040
moisture and

174
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:41,560
ventilation. When planted in a new pot,

175
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,560
the orchid will grow faster.

176
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,839
Goodbye.

177
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,600
After planting, you take care of orchids

178
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,600
like other normal plants.

179
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,440
Take care of your orchids with all the
