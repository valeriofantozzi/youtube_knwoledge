Hello everyone. Today I'm sharing a way

276
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,679
to propagate orchids using a simple and

277
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,039
easy method that anyone can

278
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:46,799
do. Please cut across here to take the

279
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:50,120
flower spike for propagation using the

280
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,120
cutting method.

282
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:07,039
When the petals have just faded, it's

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,039
the best time to take cutings for orchid

[Music]

285
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,559
propagation. The parts of the flower

286
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:20,279
that have already fully bloomed can no

287
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,279
longer be used for propagation.

289
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,960
and choose the raised or protruding

290
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,960
parts of the flower

growing tips. It's wonderful to have you

307
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:05,640
along. Uh make a diagonal cut here as it

308
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,640
will help with easier water absorption.

309
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,840
Next, you need to prepare an aloe vera

310
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,159
leaf. Choose a fresh, thick leaf that is

311
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,240
not damaged.

312
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:35,919
Aloe vera has antibacterial properties

313
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,919
and helps the orchid grow

314
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:42,399
stronger. Once you have the aloe vera

315
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,399
leaf, cut it into thin

316
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:49,120
slices. Let me know in the comments

317
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,200

[Laughter]

321
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,840
After cutting the aloe vera into thin

322
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:20,200
slices, place them in a cup and add

323
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,200
about 500 ml of water.

324
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,919
Um, the water will help dissolve the

325
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,279
nutrients from the aloe vera, creating a

326
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,760
supplement that aids in the healthy

327
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,760
growth of the

328
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:41,840
orchid. To enhance the effectiveness,

329
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:43,559
you can add a little honey to the aloe

330
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,320
vera water

331
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:50,760
solution. Honey helps the orchid fight

332
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,760
bacteria and provides extra nutrients.

333
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,440
Just add about 1 teaspoon of honey to

334
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,440
the cup and stir well to mix the

335
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,440
ingredients.

336
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,840
Leave the cup of water in a cool place

337
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:22,240
for a few hours so the nutrients from

338
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,399
the aloe vera and honey dissolve into

339
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,399
the

340
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:31,760
water. After the solution has been

341
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:35,480
soaked for a few hours, use a strainer

342
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,480
to filter out the residue.

343
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,039
You only need to keep the clear liquid

344
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,880
which contains the dissolved nutrients

345
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:02,840
from the aloe vera and honey to nourish

346
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,840
the orchid in the best way.

347
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,440
After filtering out the residue, soak

348
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:29,960
the orchid cutting you want to propagate

349
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,960
in this aloe vera and honey mixture.

350
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:37,119
uh soak it for about 20 minutes to allow

351
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,960
the orchid cutting to absorb the

352
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,760
nutrients and boost its ability to

353
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,520
develop strong roots. This is an

354
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,800
important step to ensure the cutting can

355
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,800
thrive during the propagation

356
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,879
process. You can use the remaining aloe

357
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:56,679
vera and honey mixture to water other

358
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:56,679
orchids in your garden.

359
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:01,280
[Music]

360
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,880
Uh this solution will provide additional

361
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,560
nutrients for the orchid promoting

362
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,560
healthy growth from the roots to the

363
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:15,280
leaves. When watering the orchids, just

364
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:19,240
apply about 10 tablespoons of the

365
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,240
solution to each pot.

366
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,960
This amount of water will be enough to

367
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:30,079
provide nutrients without causing the

368
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,079
plants to become water

369
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,000
logged. Make sure to water evenly around

370
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:44,200
the base of the plant to help it absorb

371
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,200
the nutrients in the best way.

372
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,720
In addition to the English voiceover, we

373
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,839
have now created voiceovers in French,

374
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:00,240
German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese,

375
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:01,920
Japanese, Hindi, and Indonesian to help

376
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,160

382
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:20,720
nutrient mixture, you can water the

00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,000
to arrange the orchid cutting.

395
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,960
Floral foam helps keep the orchid

396
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,720
cutting in place and retains moisture,

397
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,720

00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,920
regularly with natural rice fertilizer

578
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:32,760
twice a month, helping the plant grow

579
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,760
strong and maintain long-term health.

Uh the result is that after 6 months

583
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,559

584
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:19,200

588
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,920
most important factor in the journey of

589
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,920
caring for

590
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:34,319

591
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:36,640
a stem to taking care of each small

592
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:39,839

593
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:41,920
meticulous attention.

finished blooming and this is the

622
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,650
perfect time for us to start the process

00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:00,400
cutings. I will cut across this old

626
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:04,480
flower stem to begin the process of

627
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,480
propagating the orchid through cutings.

628
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,680
We need to cut neatly to avoid crushing

629
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,520
the cut, creating the best conditions

630
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:13,190
for the orchid cutting to grow into a

634
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:26,960
layer around the dormant bud to help

635
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,480
stimulate it to sprout faster, which

636
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:32,040
will encourage the young plant to grow

637
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,040

00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:40,319
Next, I take an onion as onions contain

640
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:42,300
a lot of nutrients and natural compounds

641
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:45,379

onions, especially antioxidants and

645
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,280

649
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,800
Onions also help prevent mold and

650
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:08,160
harmful bacteria, keeping the cutting

651
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,160
healthy throughout the development

652
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:16,200

653
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:24,079
extract the onion juice.

660
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,350
10 minutes to allow the onion juice to

661
00:54:46,640 --> 00:55:21,440
soak into the cutting.

663
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:25,839
Uh after soaking the cutting in onion

664
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:29,240
juice for about 10 minutes, take it out

665
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:31,520
and let the cut dry naturally for a few

666
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:33,280
hours. This helps the cut to heal,

667
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:35,040
reducing the risk of infection and

668
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:38,760
creating optimal conditions for root

00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,760
development later on.

670
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:46,640
Then apply a special plant glue to the

671
00:55:44,119 --> 00:55:48,799
cut, which helps prevent water from

672
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:51,119
seeping into the wound. This will

673
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:53,440
protect the cut from bacteria and mold,

674
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:55,240
thus preventing rot and allowing the new

675
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,680
plant to grow

676
00:55:55,240 --> 00:56:00,000
healthily. Then place the cutting in a

677
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:02,559
cool, wellventilated area to allow the

678
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,319
glue to dry completely.

679
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,480
This will help the glue dry evenly and

680
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:08,240
form a solid protective layer,

681
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:11,440
preventing bacterial infection and

682
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,440
supporting better growth of the

683
00:56:12,359 --> 00:56:17,119

684
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:19,920
completely, take one teaspoon of

685
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:22,160
cinnamon powder and soak it in one liter

715
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:11,920
I have recycled a plastic bottle to

prevent water from accumulating which

726
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:37,040

insert the cutting and mist it regularly

730
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:55,839

Then place the orchid pots in a spot

955
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,880
with gentle sunlight to help the orchids

956
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:18,239
photosynthesize well.

958
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:22,159
However, avoid direct sunlight,

959
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:24,480
especially the harsh midday sun, as it

960
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:26,810
can cause leaf burn, heat shock, and

961
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:29,959
stress to the plants.

968
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,840
developed quickly and are very healthy.

Healthy new roots promote faster growth,

providing a strong foundation for the

972
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:16,040

providing a strong foundation for the

its resilience against harsh

978
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:43,480
factors. You can see that the orchid has

979
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:43,480
produced many new flower spikes.

980
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,840
You see, on the same tree, four new

981
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:52,840
flower branches can grow at the same

982
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:52,840

01:16:54,600 --> 01:17:01,440
Continue to care for your orchids with

all the love and dedication you have for

990
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,679

991

effort, the beautiful blooms you receive

992
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:11,840
will be a wonderful reward, a testament

993
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:15,600
