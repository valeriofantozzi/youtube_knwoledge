Welcome to my little

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,759
garden. Today I will share with you a

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,040
simple and easy method to take care of

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,040
orchids that you can do at

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,600
home. Help your orchid grow quickly and

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:21,140
keep its leaves green. The root system

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,359
stays healthy to absorb nutrients to the

00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:27,519
maximum. Produce more flower buds and

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,519
bloom all year round.

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,760
With this method, the flowers not only

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,680
bloom, but also stay fresh longer on the

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,360
stem, keeping your orchid healthy,

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,640
vibrant, and

15
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,920
radiant. Let's get

16
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,239
started. Before preparing the

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,220
fertilizer, I always carefully check the

18
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:51,719
condition of the

plant. Please carefully check the roots

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,280
of the orchid. If you see any roots that

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,039
are soft, darkened, or rotting, you

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,120
should use clean scissors to cut them

24
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,040
off immediately. This helps prevent

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,040
infection and allows the plant to grow

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,040
better.

46
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,040
pots once. This helps the plants not to

47
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,120
go into shock when fertilizing and

48
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,599
creates conditions for the roots to

49
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,640
absorb nutrients more effectively during

50
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,640
the subsequent care process.

51
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,280
If you are a beginner and unsure about

52
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,879
how to water your plant, I recommend

53
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,000
observing the color of the roots to

54
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,000
determine the right time to

55
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,319
water. Um, when the roots turn silvery

56
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,840
white or grayish white, that is a sign

57
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,840
that the plant is thirsty and needs

58
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,840
watering.

[Music]

60
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,440
The orchid growing medium needs to stay

61
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,260
moist but not soaked. If the medium is

62
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:20,440
dry, gently water it to maintain

[Music]

64
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,959
moisture. I water the plants once a

65
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,800
week. This method ensures the plants

66
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,159
absorb water evenly with no risk of

67
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,159
overwatering or drought.

69
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,840
If the roots are transparent green or

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,040
fresh green, the plant has enough water

71
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,040
and you do not need to water yet.

Uh this simple observation will help you

76
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,400
avoid overwatering that can cause root

77
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,240

81
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,880
bananas? When eating bananas, you often

82
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,880
peel them and throw the peels away.

83
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,960
Don't do that. I'll show you a very

84
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:55,400
useful orchid care recipe using these

85
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,840
banana peels to make a wonderful natural

86
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,960
fertilizer. Banana peels contain many

87
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,400
natural minerals, vitamins, and

88
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,479
potassium. They are an excellent source

89
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,240
of nutrients that help orchid roots grow

90
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,080
strong and leaves stay lush

91
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:13,039

92
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,440
dry them for storage and long-term use.

93
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,199
Dried banana peels are convenient, easy

94
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,080
to store, and still retain many

95
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,840
nutrients that are good for

96
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,560
orchids. Banana peels can be dried in

97
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,479
the sun or dehydrated. Both methods help

98
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,600
preserve the peels longer while still

99
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,600

peels and cut them into small slices.

103
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,240
Cutting them into small pieces helps the

104
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,039

109
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,039

117
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,560
for a long time but do not bloom, this

118
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,120
may be a sign that the roots or growing

119
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,120

120
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,250

125
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:09,000

126
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,000

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,940
the plant from getting infected and

stimulate new root growth. This is a

136
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,340

141
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,470

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,279
Then put the mixture into a spray bottle

195
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,279

198
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,320
orchid, especially the unders sides of

199
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,160
the leaves and the leaf axles. This

200
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,240
method helps the plant absorb nutrients

201
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,240
better and effectively prevent pests and

202
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,240
diseases.

[Music]

204
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,760
Regular spraying helps wash away dust

205
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,160
that sticks to the leaves, keeping the

206
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,639
orchid leaves clean and healthy and

207
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,639

00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,800
photosynthesis. Additionally, spraying

210
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,800
helps limit the growth of fungal

211
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,560
diseases, keeping the orchid fresh and

212
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,560
promoting steady daily growth.

213
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,440
You should spray the natural fertilizer

214
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,279
in the morning about twice a month. This

215
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,790
frequency helps the orchid absorb

216
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,360
nutrients regularly and grow

217
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:10,959

218
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,880
healthy. Then place the orchid pot in a

219
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:16,000
spot with gentle sunlight so the plant

220
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,600
can photosynthesize better. Remember, no

221
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,360
matter how good the fertilizer is,

222
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,839
without enough sunlight the plant will

223
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,839
struggle to grow.

224
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,959
You can place the orchid pot on a window

225
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,790
sill or under a specialized shade net

226
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:44,360

228
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,279
orchids. I dilute the remaining natural

229
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,410
fertilizer mixture with water at a 1:1

230
00:15:49,279 --> 00:16:04,460
ratio before use.

[Music]

232
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,519
Then add two vitamin B1 tablets to the

233
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,770
mixture to stimulate healthier plant

234
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,850
growth.

235
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,850

238
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,279
Then soak the orchid roots in the banana

239
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,000
peel and vitamin B1 mixture for about 20

240
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,759
minutes. This method helps stimulate new

241
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,120
root growth and prevent drought stress

242
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,600
when planting into the new pot and

243
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:10,360

245
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,799
medium. While waiting for the roots to

246
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,720
soak, I use a soft cloth soaked in the

247
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,360
mixture to gently wipe the upper and

248
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,439
lower surfaces of the leaves. This helps

249
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:25,319
clean the leaves and directly provide

250
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,319
nutrients to the plant.

260
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,280
I choose pots with drainage holes at the

261
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,600
bottom and around for growing orchids.

262
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,520
This helps prevent water logging and

263
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,919
promotes healthier plant

264
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:28,160
growth. Um, to help the orchid stabilize

265
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,640
after planting, I make stakes to keep

266
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,480
the plant secure. This method prevents

267
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,000
the plant from leaning, protects new

268
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,480
roots, and helps the plant grow

269
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,980
healthier.

Um, the orchid growing medium I choose

276
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,280
is large pine bark. Uh this type keeps

277
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,960
the roots well ventilated while

278
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,410
maintaining appropriate moisture for the

281
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,840

can water every day without worrying

283
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:39,089

Growing orchids in large pine bark is

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,260
ideal for those who have plenty of time

290
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,799
plants. On the surface of the orchid

291
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:03,120
pot, spread a thin layer of moss to help

292
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,679
retain moisture in the soil, reduce

293
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,880
rapid evaporation, and create an ideal

294
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,880

296
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:17,039
If you don't have moss, you can replace

297
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:19,280
it with pine bark chips. Pine bark chips

298
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,940
also help retain moisture and provide
