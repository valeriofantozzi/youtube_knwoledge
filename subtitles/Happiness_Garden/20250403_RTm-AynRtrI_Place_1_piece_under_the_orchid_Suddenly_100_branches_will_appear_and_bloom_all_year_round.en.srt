welcome to my garden in this video I

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,200
continue to share how to make natural

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,559
fertilizer to care for and restore

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,679
orchids after blooming so they can keep

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,719
growing and Bloom vigorously in the next

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,600

care tips it's wonderful to have you

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,800
along now let's get

11
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:32,040
started this is the Orchid after

12
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:34,120
blooming that I bought from an orchid

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,640
shop at a clearance price of just $1 per

14
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,640
plant like

15
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,810
[Music]

16
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,640
this the Orchid is in a state where the

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,760
flower spike is withered and the petals

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,760
have faded and dried

19
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,689
[Music]

20
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,519
[Music]

21
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,479
first we need to trim off the withered

22
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,799
flower Spike this helps the plant Focus

23
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,920
its nutrients on the leaves roots and

24
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,920
new CHS instead of sustaining The Faded

25
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,920
flowers

26
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:33,010
[Music]

27
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:43,439
then remove any damaged or rotting

28
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,759
leaves this helps protect the plant from

29
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:50,079
fungal infections as decaying or damaged

30
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,079
leaves can Harbor fungi bacteria and

31
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,920
pests next trim off any damaged or

32
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,840
rotting Roots as decaying or damaged

33
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,600
Roots create an ideal environment for

34
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,240
fungi and bacteria to grow removing them

35
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,880
helps prevent the spread of disease to

36
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,880
other parts of the

37
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,569
[Music]

38
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,800
plant as you can see this Orchid still

39
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,319
has a fairly healthy root system but

40
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,440
because it hasn't been watered for a

41
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:38,680
long time the plant has become weak

42
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,680
causing the leaves to wilt

43
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:53,560
significantly do you have lemons we can

44
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,560
use either yellow lemons or green

45
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,800
ones take half a lemon and squeeze the

46
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,800
juice into a

47
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,159
cup lemon has natural antibacterial

48
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,000
properties helping to prevent the growth

49
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:13,080
of bacteria and fungi in the growing

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,720
medium supporting the Orchid and

51
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,720
avoiding issues like root or Leaf

52
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,599
rot then dilute it with 1 lit of room

53
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,599
temperature water

54
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,720
make sure to strain out the pulp and

55
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,720
only keep the diluted lemon

56
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,480
juice please comment and let me know

57
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,400
which country you're watching the video

58
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:52,519
from it's wonderful that we can chat

59
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,519
together from all around the world

60
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,799
then dip the leaves into the diluted

61
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,760
lemon juice for about 1 minute this

62
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,280
helps disinfect and recover the wilted

63
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,280
Orchid more

64
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,400
effectively lemon juice is acidic and

65
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,479
leaving it on for too long can damage or

66
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,639
burn the leaves therefore it should only

67
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:26,639
be dip gently and

68
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,080
quickly then wait for 1 minute before

69
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,600
removing it this will help eliminate

70
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,600
fungi and bacteria more

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,240
effectively after gently dipping for

72
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,960
about 1 minute immediately remove the

73
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,120
leaves from the diluted lemon juice to

74
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,680
avoid prolonged exposure to the acid

75
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,759
which could harm the

76
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:54,440
leaves use a clean soft cloth or paper

77
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,600
towel to gently wipe and blot dry any

78
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,160
remaining moisture on the leaves this

79
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,639
helps prevent mold or bacteria from

80
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,639
developing due to prolonged

81
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,919
dampness this method helps protect the

82
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,280
Orchid from the negative effects of

83
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:17,720
lemon juice while also providing the

84
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,840
benefits of antibacterial properties and

85
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,840
stimulating the plant's growth

86
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,009
[Music]

87
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,360
next we dip The Roots into the diluted

88
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,360
lemon

89
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,440
juice lemon juice has natural acidic

90
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,759
properties that help disinfect The Roots

91
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,280
preventing the growth of mold and

92
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:56,560
harmful bacteria especially in cases

93
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,560
where the roots are rotting or diseased

94
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,280
diluted lemon juice helps stimulate the

95
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,080
growth of new Roots by creating a

96
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,440
favorable environment for nutrient

97
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,080
absorption which in turn helps the plant

98
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,080
recover more

99
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,080
quickly soak the roots in this mixture

100
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,080
for about 10

101
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,280
minutes for anting orchids I use pine

102
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,280
bark chips as the growing

103
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,759
medium to limit fungi and diseases I

104
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,560
need to treat the growing medium for the

105
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:43,560
orchids before

106
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,960
planting then I pour the diluted lemon

107
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:58,680
juice to soak the Orchid growing medium

108
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,680
for about 10 minutes

109
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,280
diluted lemon juice helps reduce the

110
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,680
growth of mold one of the causes of root

111
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,080
and leaf rot in orchids this is

112
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:14,400
important to keep the growing medium

113
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,400
clean and prevent the development of

114
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,080
fungi once the growing medium is treated

115
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,960
the Orchid will face fewer harmful

116
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:27,599
environmental factors helping the plant

117
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,599
grow stronger and better resist diseases

118
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,840
then we wait for about 10 minutes before

119
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,840
planting the

120
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,159
Orchid after soaking for about 10

121
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,800
minutes we proceed to plant the Orchid

122
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:47,800
into the new

123
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:57,639
pot we take the pine bark out to plant

124
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,639
the Orchid into the pot

125
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
as you can see after soaking the roots

126
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,720
in the diluted lemon juice for about 10

127
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,680
minutes The Roots become clean and fresh

128
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:30,440
again which helps the orchid's recovery

129
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,440
process happen faster

130
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,240
carefully place the Orchid into the pot

131
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:43,800
making sure the roots are evenly

132
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,800
distributed Not Bent or cramped

133

[Music]

134
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,440
avoid pressing the plant too tightly

135
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,640
into the pot as this can damage the

136
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,600
roots and affect the plant's growth

137
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,640
simply press the growing medium gently

138
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,880
to ensure the plant stands firm without

139
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,880
being

140
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,139
[Music]

141
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,959
cramped after planting spread a layer of

142
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,720
dry moss over the Orchid pot this helps

143
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,279
protect the roots from direct sunlight

144
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,040
especially when the plant is newly

145
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:34,240
potted it reduces the risk of root burn

146
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,240
and helps the roots develop

147
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,560
better after planting leave the Orchid

148
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:00,839
in a cool well ventilated place for a

149
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,839
day and do not water it

150
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,760
uh in the first 24 hours after planting

151
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,959
The Roots need time to adjust to the new

152
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,640
growing medium if you water immediately

153
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,160
the medium could become saturated

154
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,279
creating a favorable environment for

155
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,880
mold and bacteria to grow leading to

156
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:19,060
root rot not watering helps minimize

157
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:24,959
this

159
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,959
risk since the orchid has a healthy root

160
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:32,079
system after one day I I proceed to

161
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:34,440
apply natural fertilizer to stimulate

162
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,440
faster

00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:44,399
growth to make natural fertilizer I take

164
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,399
a slice of fresh potato

until

171
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:28,360
smooth potatoes are rich in vitamins and

172
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,920
minerals especially potassium phosphorus

173
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,000
and some Amino acids these nutrients

then strain out the residue straining

182
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,199
helps make the fertilizer water clearer

183
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,800
reducing the risk of bacteria and fungi

184
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:27,519
growing in the undissolved particles

185
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,519
this also helps prevent harm to the

186

Orchid

187
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,440
then dilute it with 1 liter of water

188
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,160
this helps reduce the concentration of

189
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,320
nutrients in the fertilizer preventing

190
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,199
nutrient overload that could damage the

00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,279
plant's

192
00:12:56,199 --> 00:13:00,160

overdosing the

195
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,079
plant after preparing the potato mixture

196
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,240
use a soft cloth to soak up the mixture

197
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:17,160

leaves the potato mixture contains

200
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:28,920
nutrients like potassium and vitamins

201
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,120

absorb these nutrients promoting strong

205
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,190
growth and improving the overall health

206
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,309

211
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,320
um the nutrients in the potato help

212
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,279
stimulate the growth of new leaves and

213
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,279
strengthen the root

214
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,360
system spraying the potato water on the

entire plant provides the Orchid with

216
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,279
extra energy to recover after periods of

217
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,279
weakness or

218
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:29,320
stress potatoes have natural

219
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,240
antibacterial properties helping to

220
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,560
protect the plant from mold bacteria and

221
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,560
common

222
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,240
diseases then water the orchid's roots

223
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,240
with the potato

224
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,040
mixture potassium and phosphorus in

225
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,800
potatoes help enhance root growth

226
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,480
particularly by encouraging strong and

227
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,480
widespread root

228
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,720
development when the the roots are

229
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,040
healthy and welldeveloped the plant can

230
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:07,240
easily absorb enough water and nutrients

231
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,240
which helps it grow more

232
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,040
holistically perform Leaf wiping

233
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,440
spraying and watering the orchid's roots

234
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,880
with the potato mixture twice a

235
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,759
month then place the Orchid pot in a

236
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,320
location with gentle sunlight so that

237
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:25,160
the plant can photosynthesize allowing

238
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,160
the natural fertilizer to work more

239
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,160
effectively

240
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,920
now let's take a look at the results

241
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:37,759
after 45 days of care and Recovery using

242
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,759
the natural potato

243
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,079
fertilizer um as you can see the orchid

244
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:48,519
has grown new leaves and become sturdier

245
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:48,519
with a shinier healthier green

246
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
color not only that but the orchid has

247
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,079
also grown a new flower Spike which

248
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,560
which clearly shows that this natural

249
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:05,959
fertilizer has a positive effect on the

250
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,959
plant's

251
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,440
growth I continue to care for this

252
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,079
Orchid using the natural potato

253
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,279

254
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:30,639
watering spraying and wiping the leaves

255
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,639
twice a month

256
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,040
the potato fertilizer helps the Orchid

257
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:40,519
quickly recover from a weakened state or

258
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,519
nutrient

259
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,360
deficiency the appearance of a new

260
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:50,680
flower spike is a clear sign that the

261
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:54,519
plant has received the necessary support

262
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,519
and is returning to a phase of strong

263
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,519
growth remember to place the Orchid pot

264
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,000
in a spot with gentle sunlight so the

265
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:07,679
plant can photosynthesize allowing the

266
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,679
natural fertilizer to work even

267
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,000
