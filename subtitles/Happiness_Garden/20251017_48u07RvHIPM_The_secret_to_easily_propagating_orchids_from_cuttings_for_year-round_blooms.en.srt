00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,319
Welcome to this cozy little space where

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,040
we care for our beloved orchid pots

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,200
together. Today I am very excited to

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,080
share with you a simple but effective

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,799
method to propagate orchids at home.

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,799
That is stem cutting.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,400
With each step I will guide you through

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,039
you will feel a connection with the

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,400
plant. And it is patience along with

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,480
care that will bring brilliant results.

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,000
Let's explore stem cutting for orchids

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,680
together so that each young chute

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,680
becomes a beautiful flower in your

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,680
garden.

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,719
Today's ingredient to make a natural

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,079
fertilizer that stimulates orchid roots

17
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,480
is ginger. You only need a small piece

18
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:54,360
of ginger like this and then carefully

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,360
cut it into thin slices.

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,879
Ginger contains special natural

21
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,600
compounds that help stimulate the growth

22
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:05,879
of orchid keis while also promoting root

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,879
and leaf development naturally.

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,600
Let me know in the comments which

25
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,600
country you're watching from. It's

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,439
wonderful that we can connect and share

27
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,840
with each other from all around the

28
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,920
world.

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,000
wonderful to have you along on this

33
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,840
journey.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,240
After slicing the ginger, the next step

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,479
is to put the fresh ginger slices into a

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,479
clean jar.

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,159
Using a clean jar will help preserve the

38
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,320
ginger better and retain its natural

39
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:46,000
nutrients, ready to stimulate the growth

40
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,000
of orchid roots and leaves.

41
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,240
Next, pour about 300 ml of warm water

42
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,560
into the jar, just enough to cover the

43
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,560
ginger slices.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The next ingredient to make natural

45
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,720
fertilizer is molasses. And you only

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,720
need a small teaspoon.

47
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,959
Molasses contains many minerals and

48
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,120
natural sugars, helping provide energy

49
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,280
for orchid roots to grow strongly and

50
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,400
stimulating beneficial microorganisms in

51
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,400
the soil to become more active.

52
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,239
After stirring the molasses into the

53
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,560
ginger solution, cover the jar tightly

54
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,879
and place it in a cool, ventilated area

55
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,879
away from direct sunlight for about 3

56
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,879
weeks.

57
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,840
Once the natural fertilizer solution is

58
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,239
ready, the next step is to select

59
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,519
healthy flower spikes for propagation

60
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,519
using the stem cutting method.

61
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,280
Choose sturdy flower stems that are free

62
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,280
from pests or damage as these will be

63
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,280
the foundation for creating healthy new

64
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,280
plants.

65
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,799
In some orchid gardens, when the flowers

66
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,280
bloom, growers often remove the dormant

67
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,440
buds that haven't opened before selling.

68
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,720
This habit makes it difficult for buyers

69
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,720
to propagate orchids from flower spikes

70
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,720
using the stem cutting method because

71
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,439
the potential stems for creating new

72
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,439
plants have been removed.

73
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,360
The orchid I bought had most of its

74
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,760
dormant buds removed before blooming.

75
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,319
Therefore, all the flower spikes on the

76
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,760
plant will also need to be removed and

77
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,280
we won't be able to use them for

78
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,280
propagation through the stem cutting

79
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,280
method.

80
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,160
Next, I also bought this orchid from an

81
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,960
industrial orchid garden when it was

82
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,199
blooming. And just like before, they had

83
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,840
removed all the dormant buds that hadn't

84
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,919
opened. This means we also cannot

85
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,840
propagate from the flower spikes as the

86
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:47,320
potential buds to create new plants are

87
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,320
no longer there.

88
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,919
As for this orchid, I planted it from

89
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,600
the beginning in my own garden. So, the

90
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,400
dormant buds that haven't bloomed are

91
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,400
still intact. This is wonderful because

92
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,400
we can use these buds for propagation

93
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,560
through the stem cutting method,

94
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,560
creating healthy new plants ready to

95
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,560
grow.

96
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:20,520
The buds that have already bloomed like

97
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,520
this, we will carefully cut off.

98
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,759
And the buds that haven't bloomed,

99
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,919
meaning inside this protective sheath,

100
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,520
there are still dormant buds have the

101
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,280
potential to develop into healthy new

102
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,680
orchids.

103
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,919
Therefore, we will proceed with stem

104
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,840
cutting from these buds, maximizing the

105
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,080
growth potential that the mother plant

106
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,080
has prepared.

107
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,600
Next, use a sharp knife to trim the cut,

108
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,520
completely removing any bruised parts

109
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,759
because bruised areas are prone to

110
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,919
rotting. and can harm the dormant buds.

111
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,560
A clean cut will keep the flower spike

112
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,880
tidy and safe, increasing the chances of

113
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,520
strong root development when propagating

114
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,520
through stem cutting.

115
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,319
Oh my god.

116
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,319
After trimming the cut, the next step is

117
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,720
to gently peel off the protective sheath

118
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,199
around the dormant bud. This sheath

119
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,120
protects the bud during development. But

120
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,680
when performing stem cutting, removing

121
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,319
it allows nutrients from the ginger

122
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,639
molasses solution to penetrate directly

123
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:30,039
into the bud, stimulating faster root

124
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,039
and leaf growth.

125
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,280
Handle it carefully so the dormant bud

126
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,639
remains intact and ready to root,

127
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,639
preparing to become a healthy new

128
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,639
orchid.

129
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,080
This is the ginger extract after 21 days

130
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,800
of fermentation, fully prepared and

131
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,599
ready to use. You will notice a layer of

132
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,080
natural white mold on top, which is a

133
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,880
sign that the solution is working well.

134
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,800
The mild sour aroma and clear color of

135
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,479
the liquid are the standards to ensure

136
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,200
its effectiveness when fertilizing

137
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,200
orchid dormant buds.

138
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,839
Next, take about 50 ml of the finished

139
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,640
ginger extract solution to prepare for

140
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,640
the stem cutting process.

141
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,959
Next, pour one liter of water into the

142
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,800
ginger extract solution to dilute it.

143
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,959
This dilution helps the nutrients from

144
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,279
the ginger distribute evenly, just

145
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,200
enough to nourish the dormant buds,

146
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,120
promote strong root development, and

147
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,640
encourage healthy leaf growth without

148
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,640
overloading the buds.

149
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,080
After diluting, pour this water to soak

150
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,920
the cutings for about 20 minutes. The

151
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,760
soaking time is just enough to allow the

152
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,600
nutrients from the solution to penetrate

153
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,600
deeply into the dormant buds,

154
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,240
stimulating quick root growth and

155
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,240
healthy leaf development.

156
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,200
The remaining mixture can be poured into

157
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:05,000
a spray bottle to water the other

158
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,000
orchids in your garden.

159
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,399
This helps the orchids receive

160
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,720
additional nutrients from the ginger,

161
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,880
stimulates strong root and leaf growth,

162
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,279
and enhances the overall vitality of the

163
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,279
entire garden.

164
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,680
When spraying the ginger extract

165
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,839
mixture, the natural nutrients from the

166
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,399
ginger penetrate deeply into the roots,

167
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,000
helping them grow quickly and strong and

168
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,519
increasing their ability to absorb

169
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,399
nutrients from the surrounding

170
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,920
environment. This creates a solid

171
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,920
foundation for the plant's overall

172
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,920
development.

173
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,360
The leaves will become glossy green,

174
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:02,160
lush, and vibrant when provided with

175
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,000
sufficient nutrients. Regularly spraying

176
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,920
the solution keeps the leaves healthy,

177
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,920
showcasing the strong vitality of the

178
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,920
orchid.

179
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,200
The ginger extract mixture helps the

180
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,360
flowers on the stems maintain their

181
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,079
vibrant appearance for longer, reducing

182
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,680
rapid wilting. This way you can enjoy

183
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,760
the beauty of fresh flowers for an

184
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,920
extended time, adding a highlight to

185
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,920
your garden.

186
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,920
Uh after soaking the cutings in the

187
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
solution for about 20 minutes, gently

188
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,040
remove them and pat dry with a soft

189
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,640
cloth. This helps remove excess water on

190
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,640
the dormant buds, preventing

191
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,920
accumulation that could cause rotting

192
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,920
during stem cutting.

193
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,720
After drying the cutings, sprinkle a

194
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,440
little cinnamon powder on the cut.

195
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,440
Cinnamon has antibacterial properties,

196
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,680
helping the cut heal quickly and

197
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,839
preventing bacteria or fungi from

198
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:26,040
causing rot. Uh protecting the dormant

199
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,040
buds during the stem cutting process.

200
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,560
And don't forget to sprinkle cinnamon

201
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,279
powder on the cuts of newly trimmed

202
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,000
orchid flower spikes. This helps protect

203
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,320
the cuts, prevent bacteria and mold from

204
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,160
entering, and supports the plant in

205
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,560
recovering more quickly after the

206
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,560
flowers fade.

207
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,399
Then then let the cutings or orchid pots

208
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,360
rest for about 1 day without watering,

209
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:13,040
allowing the cuts to dry completely.

210
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,920
This helps prevent the cuts from rotting

211
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,839
and creates a natural protective layer

212
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,079
before proceeding with stem cutting or

213
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,079
further care.

214
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,000
Uh while waiting for the cuts to dry, I

215
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,839
take the opportunity to recycle used

216
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,519
plastic cups, turning them into tools

217
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,519
for rooting the cutings.

218
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,120
Small, clean, and manageable plastic

219
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,519
cups help create an ideal environment

220
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,839
for dormant buds to root, maintain

221
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,839
proper moisture, and allow easy

222
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,560
observation of the young plant's growth.

223
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,320
This recycling is both economical and

224
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,000
environmentally friendly while also

225
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,000
preparing you for the next step of stem

226
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
cutting.

227
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,519
For the rooting pot, I choose pots with

228
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,199
drainage holes at the bottom. Uh the

229
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,920
drainage holes help prevent water

230
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:26,079
logging, maintain moderate moisture in

231
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:30,160
the growing medium, and ensure the

232
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:31,920
cutting's roots develop healthily.

233
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,079
For the main growing medium, I choose

234
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,320
finely shredded pine bark that has been

235
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,480
thoroughly sterilized.

236
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,720
Shredded pine bark retains moisture

237
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,320
well, drains effectively, and provides a

238
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,560
well-arrated environment for orchid

239
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:48,760
roots to grow, while also limiting the

240
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,760
development of fungi and diseases.

241
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,880
To complete the rooting pot, I add a

242
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,440
little thoroughly sterilized dry moss on

243
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,600
top of the pot. This layer of moss helps

244
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,839
maintain stable moisture for the cutings

245
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,519
while creating a soft environment that

246
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:26,120
protects the dormant buds and young

247
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,120
roots as the plant begins to grow.

248
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,120
After one day, when the cuts on the

249
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,800
cutings have completely dried, we

250
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:53,240
proceed to plant the cutings into the

251
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,240
pots with the prepared growing medium.

252
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,240
Gently place the dormant bud into the

253
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,480
growing medium, making sure the bud

254
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,800
faces upward.

255
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,720
Correct orientation helps the roots grow

256
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,880
downward while the leaves and young

257
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,639
shoots grow upward, creating balance and

258
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,839
increasing the chances of success when

259
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,839
propagating through stem cutting.

260
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,079
Then regularly spray water to maintain

261
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,560
moisture, especially when the growing

262
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,560
medium starts to dry.

263
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,880
Maintaining moderate moisture helps the

264
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,199
cutting roots develop well, prevents the

265
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,639
dormant buds from wilting, and creates

266
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,440
an ideal environment for the young

267
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,440
plants to root quickly.

268
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,600
Then gently use pins to secure the

269
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,839
cutting so that the dormant buds make

270
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,120
good contact with the shredded pine bark

271
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:15,280
and the dry moss on the surface.

272
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,039
This helps the plant stay upright,

273
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,120
prevents shifting during root and leaf

274
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,799
development, and ensures the dormant

275
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:25,160
buds receive adequate moisture and

276
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:25,160
nutrients from the growing medium.

277
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,600
Next, use a plastic cup with holes

278
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,120
punched around it to cover the top of

279
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,880
the pot, creating a mini greenhouse.

280
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,799
The mini greenhouse helps maintain

281
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,720
stable humidity, protects the cutings

282
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,480
from drying out quickly, and creates an

283
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,640
ideal environment for the dormant buds

284
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,640
to develop.

285
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,440
And here are the results after 45 days

286
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,440
of rooting the cutings.

287
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,760
You can see that the small dormant buds

288
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,240
after rooting have now developed into

289
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:26,919
fairly healthy young orchids with deep

290
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,919
rooted roots and lush green leaves.

291
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,400
Um, the young orchid from this cutting

292
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:41,280
is still small, but its roots and leaves

293
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,960
are developing very healthily. This

294
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,720
proves that the stem cutting method

295
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,400
combined with the use of the ginger

296
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,400
extract solution and the prepared

297
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,000
growing medium has created ideal

298
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,400
conditions for the young plant to

299
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,400
develop fully.

300
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,480
The young orchid from this cutting,

301
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,400
though smaller than the previous one, is

302
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,160
quite sturdy. Although the leaves

303
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,160
haven't fully developed, the plant has

304
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,160
already grown its first root, showing

305
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,799
that the dormant bud is rooting and

306
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,440
ready to continue growing. This is a

307
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:26,000
positive sign indicating that the stem

308
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,919
cutting process is progressing well and

309
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,919
the young orchid will continue to mature

310
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,919
healthily.

311
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:39,039
Continue to spray water regularly when

312
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,880
the growing medium starts to dry,

313
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,919
maintaining the necessary moisture for

314
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,919
the roots and dormant buds. At the same

315
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,320
time, place the rooting pot in a cool

316
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,720
area away from direct sunlight to help

317
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:55,720
the young orchid develop steadily with

318
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,720
strong roots and vibrant green leaves.

319
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:09,720
And here are the results after 3 months

320
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,720
of stem cutting.

321
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,480
You can see that from a single cutting

322
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,400
with just dormant buds, they have now

323
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,799
developed into very healthy young

324
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,520
orchids with strong roots and lush green

325
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:24,160
leaves. This process proves that with

326
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,080
patience and proper care, even small

327
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,240
dormant buds can become vibrant young

328
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,240
orchids ready for the next blooming

329
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,240
seasons.

330
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,400
Um, when the orchid has developed strong

331
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,120
roots That is the ideal time to start

332
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,120
fertilizing the plant.

333
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,799
What do you think about the way I

334
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,880
propagate orchids using the stem cutting

335
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:25,360
method? Don't hesitate to leave a

grow healthy and bloom beautifully all

347
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,240
year round.

348
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:04,960
Next, take 3 teaspoons of ginger extract

349
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:07,200
and mix with 500 ml of clean water to

350
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,640
water water the orchid. This solution

351
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,400
will provide sufficient nutrients,

352
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,320
stimulate strong root growth and lush

353
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,200
green leaves, and enhance the overall

354
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,200
vitality of the plant.

355
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,240
Then water the orchid one to two times a

356
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,240
month with this ginger extract liquid

357
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,240
fertilizer.

358
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,080
You can also alternate with other

359
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,400
natural fertilizers to diversify the

360
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,400
nutrient sources for the orchid.

361
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,799
Rotating different types of fertilizers

362
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,200
helps the plant absorb all the necessary

363
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:59,520
minerals, stimulating even and healthy

364
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,320
growth of roots, leaves, and flower

365
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,840
buds. This combination not only enhances

366
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,159
care efficiency, but also helps the

367
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:10,520
orchid adapt well to its environment,

368
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,520
maintaining long-lasting vitality.

369
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,799
Care for your orchid with all the love

370
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:21,520
and dedication you have for plants. When

371
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:23,840
you patiently observe, water, fertilize,

372
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,280
and attend to every small detail,

373
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,679
gradually you will see your garden

374
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,400
filled with healthy orchids blooming in

375
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,159
vibrant colors. Loving care not only

376
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,840
helps the plants grow well, but also

377
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,080
