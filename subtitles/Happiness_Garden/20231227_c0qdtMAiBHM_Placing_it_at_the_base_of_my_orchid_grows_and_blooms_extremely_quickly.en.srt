5
00:00:30,894 --> 00:00:36,893
This orchid has disease on its leaves.

6
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:45,891
And if you don't know how to take care of it, it will be stunted and not bloom.

7
00:00:47,082 --> 00:00:56,889
We remove yellow leaves and dry branches and dry roots.

8
00:01:21,884 --> 00:01:29,883
When eating tangerines, don't throw away the peel.

9
00:01:29,883 --> 00:01:38,885
because tangerine peel contains many essential substances for orchids.

10
00:01:45,226 --> 00:01:55,878
And garlic also has many essential substances to care for orchids.

11
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:18,873
I took 1 clove of garlic and 1 tangerine peel.

12
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:26,871
Add 1 liter of water.

13
00:02:38,335 --> 00:02:46,867
then puree.

14
00:02:53,685 --> 00:03:00,898
then filter out the residue.

15
00:03:15,376 --> 00:03:26,893
Mix 1 liter of water.

16
00:03:32,164 --> 00:03:36,891
Step 1

17
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:50,888
Wash the leaves with this water once a month.

18
00:03:54,887 --> 00:04:03,886
Tangerine peel and garlic contain essential oils that have natural antibacterial and anti-pest properties.

19
00:04:06,252 --> 00:04:16,883
Using tangerine peel and garlic will help reduce the risk of disease for orchids.

20
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:26,881
If you apply this method regularly, the orchid will not be harmed by pests and diseases, 

21
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:34,879
so the leaves will always be green and healthy.

22
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:40,878
Step 2

23
00:04:40,878 --> 00:04:50,876
Water the orchid roots with this water once a week

24
00:04:52,876 --> 00:05:02,874
Tangerine peel and garlic contain minerals and nutrients that are very good for orchid growth.

25
00:05:06,422 --> 00:05:16,871
Tangerine peel also provides trace elements and other nutrients for orchids.

26
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:28,869
Garlic contains nitrogen, an important nutrient that promotes leaf growth.

27
00:05:30,868 --> 00:05:39,900
Garlic also provides potassium, an important nutrient that helps roots and orchids resist the effects of stress.

28
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:46,898
Soak in this water for 10 minutes then take out the orchid pot.

29
00:05:47,058 --> 00:05:50,898
Step 3

30
00:06:08,438 --> 00:06:16,893
Now spray this water on the leaves once a week.

31
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:26,891
Nitrogen in garlic plays an important role in the synthesis of protein

32
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:34,889
and chlorophyll, helping orchids maintain their green color.

33
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:46,887
This water helps protect orchids from plant health problems.

34
00:06:50,148 --> 00:06:53,885
Result.

35
00:06:53,885 --> 00:07:03,883
After applying this fertilizer for 3 months, the orchids grew healthily.

36
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:22,879
Roots, stems, and leaves all develop well.

37
00:07:36,338 --> 00:07:41,876
After 5 months the orchid will bloom.

38
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:56,873
The flower colors are vibrant and stay on the branches for a long time before fading.

39
00:07:59,872 --> 00:08:06,871
Hope the video helps you a lot.

00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:17,869
