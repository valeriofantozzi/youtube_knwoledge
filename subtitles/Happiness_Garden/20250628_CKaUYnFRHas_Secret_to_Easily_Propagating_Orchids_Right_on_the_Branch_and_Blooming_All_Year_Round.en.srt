Hello everyone. In today's video, I will

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,000
share a simple but very interesting way

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,679
to propagate orchids from the flower

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,840
spike that has already bloomed.

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,080
This is a gentle and easy method that

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,320
helps you create new orchid pots right

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,320
at home.

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,359
Let's get started.

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,079
When the flowers on the spike begin to

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,160
fade, that is the perfect time to cut

13
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,160
the spike and start the propagation

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,160
process.

[Music]

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,840
Um, at this time, the flower spike still

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,000
contains enough nutrients and vitality

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,000
to develop into a new plant if handled

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
correctly.

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,799
the nodes that have already bloomed will

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,799
no longer be able to produce new

24
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,799
plantlets.

26
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,360
And here are the nodes that have never

27
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,520
bloomed. They still have the potential

28
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,280
to develop into plantlets if cared for

29
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:44,310
properly. These dormant eyes are where

30
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,119
uh new life for your orchid is hidden.

[Music]

32
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,560
Gently cut off the nodes that have

33
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,200
already bloomed as they no longer have

34
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,200
the ability to grow.

35
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,759
I choose two nodes that have not bloomed

36
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,520
to propagate using the cutting method.

37
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,960
This is a simple and effective way to

38
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,229
make use of the still healthy flower

39
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:20,279
spike to create a new orchid plant.

41
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,560
I trim the cut area to remove the

42
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,239
damaged part. This helps prevent rot and

43
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,480
creates favorable conditions for the

44
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,959
spike to recover quickly, ready for the

45
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,959

have you along on this journey.

51
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,680
I gently peel off the thin membrane

52
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,239
surrounding the dormant bud at each

53
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,400

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,040
I cut the bottom of the spike at an

67
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,560
angle to increase the surface area in

68
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,280
contact with the rooting and sprouting

69
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,520
solution. This allows nutrients to be

70
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:44,040
absorbed more easily, helping the spike

71
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,040
to root quickly and develop new shoots.

72
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,639
I prepare one to two fresh aloe vera

73
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,320
leaves. This familiar ingredient not

74
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,000
only helps naturally stimulate root

75
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:22,199
growth but also protects the spike from

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,199
harmful bacteria and fungi.

78
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,560
I insert the cutting into the middle

79
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,800
along the flesh of the aloe vera leaf so

80
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,740
the gel can be absorbed directly into

81
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,949
the spike.

[Music]

83
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,320
Insert the cutting so that the dormant

84
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,080
bud is submerged in the aloe vera flesh.

85
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,240
This helps the bud absorb maximum

86
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,240
nutrients, thereby stimulating faster

87
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,240
sprouting.

88
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,319
This method allows the nutrients from

89
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:20,919
the aloe vera to penetrate more deeply,

90
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,919
promoting the rooting process naturally.

91
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,199
After that, I leave it undisturbed for

92
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:37,280
about 1 hour so the aloe vera gel can be

93
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,280
evenly absorbed into the spike.

94
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,960
Cut the remaining aloe vera leaf into

95
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,720
small pieces and place them in a clean

96
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,479

97
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,160
We will use this part to continue

98
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,720
supporting the rooting process and keep

99
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,720
the cutting moist.

Next, I add the chopped aloe vera into

500 ml of room temperature water. This

103
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,160
mixture will create a moisturizing

104
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,880

boiling water.

117
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,879
The steam will help extract the natural

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,039
antibacterial compounds from the

119
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:07,120
cinnamon, creating a more effective

120
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:09,280
solution for supporting the cutting.

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,599

Uh while waiting for the solution to

124
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,199

125
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:25,080
two used plastic cups to make seedling

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,920

mix it with the aloe vera solution to

145
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,640
create a root nourishing mixture. Before

146
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,320
using it for planting, I strain out the

149
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,279
Next, I prepare some vitamin B1.

150
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,279
This familiar ingredient helps stimulate

157
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,240

Maintaining stable moisture helps

251
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,840
prevent the cutting from drying out and

252
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,840

gentle light, but away from direct

256

257
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,840
help the dormant bud develop well and

258
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,559

To make the fertilizer, I use one

279
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,039
teaspoon of rice. Since the plant is

280
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,960
still small and young, a moderate amount

281
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,039
of fertilizer will provide gentle

282
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:47,240
nutrients and avoid shocking the plant

283
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,240
during the early growth stage.

284
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:59,290

289
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,160
I pour the rice water into a spray

bottle, preparing to mist it evenly over

291
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,799

Place the plant in a spot with gentle

301
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,880
sunlight so the orchid can

302
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,799
photosynthesize effectively. Proper
