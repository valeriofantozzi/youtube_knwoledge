and sharing so that more people know about this orchid growing tip.

5
00:00:43,892 --> 00:00:52,890
These are the branches after the flowers have faded.

6
00:01:05,575 --> 00:01:16,885
But these buttons can continue to bloom if you know how to care for them.

7
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:39,881
I cut off all the wilted flowers.

8
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:58,877
and cut off diseased leaves so they don't spread further.

9
00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:12,874
and cut off all damaged roots.

10
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:43,868
Then sprinkle cinnamon powder on the cut to help it dry quickly and prevent disease.

11
00:02:55,899 --> 00:03:02,898
Then leave it for 1 day without watering until the cut dries.

12
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:13,895
1 Day Later.

13
00:03:15,053 --> 00:03:20,894
Take 2 liters of water.

14
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:36,891
Take 1 tablespoon of rice.

15
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:53,888
then take 3 teaspoons of soybeans.

16
00:03:57,887 --> 00:04:06,885
Pour in 1 liter of boiled water.

17
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:22,882
Wait for the water to cool before using.

18
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,879
1 Hour Later.

19
00:04:43,878 --> 00:04:53,876
Decant this rice water.

20
00:05:00,358 --> 00:05:10,872
Mix the water to soak the soybeans with the rice water.

21
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:36,867
Then take these seeds and sprinkle them into each pot of 10-20 seeds.

22
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:46,698
and buried deep under tree roots.

23
00:06:05,895 --> 00:06:15,893
Now I use this water to water orchid roots once a week.

24
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:26,377
Rice water contains many nutrients, including potassium, phosphorus 

25
00:06:28,035 --> 00:06:36,033
and several minerals that are beneficial for plant growth.

26
00:06:38,414 --> 00:06:47,886
Soybeans contain a lot of nitrogen, an important element for plant growth.

27
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:55,885
especially during the stage of bean blooming and leaf development.

28
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:08,882
And I continue to spray this water on the leaves once a week.

29
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:19,880
Soybeans also provide protein and amino acids to help plants grow strongly.

30
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:29,878
and spray on branches to stimulate bud growth.

31
00:07:37,576 --> 00:07:40,876
1 Month Later.

32
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:55,873
Old orchid branches continue to grow new shoots.

33
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:17,869
This helps blooming orchids continue to bud and bloom.

34
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:50,895
After that I continued to water the orchid with rice water once a week.

35
00:09:06,892 --> 00:09:16,890
and I continue to spray the orchids with rice water once a week.

36
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:30,887
Spraying on branches also helps provide more nutrients so flower buds develop better.

37
00:09:49,912 --> 00:09:52,883
AFTER NEXT 1 MONT.

38
00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:03,881
Flowers continue to bloom many magical flowers.

39
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:12,879
Hope the video helps you a lot.

40
00:10:16,878 --> 00:10:26,876
