Hello everyone. In this video, I will

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,440
share a very simple method of

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,000
propagating orchids from flower spikes

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,679
so you can easily grow new orchids at

00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,920
home. If you haven't subscribed to the

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,600
orchid growing tips. It's wonderful to

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,410
have you along for the journey. Let's

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:30,080
get started.

[Music]

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,239
After blooming, the best time to

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,700
propagate orchids from flower spikes is

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,000
for the following

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,520
[Music]

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,079
reasons. After the flowers fade, the

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,840
flower stem remains fresh and healthy.

18
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,920
During this time, the flower stem does

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,480
not wither, allowing the plant to easily

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,760
develop new shoots. The flower stem can

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,220
still provide nutrients for the

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:59,760
propagation process.

[Music]

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,520
This node has not yet bloomed. So

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,520
sprouting from this node is very

26
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:18,799
[Music]

27
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,960
easy. Um we discard this part because it

28
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,120
has already bloomed and can no longer

29
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:34,760
sprout.

31
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,119
trim the cut to avoid bruising the

32
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,119
orchid

34
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:51,960
cutting. If the cut is bruised, the

35
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,960
orchid cutting is very likely to rot.

36
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,740

Take some ground coffee powder.

Then sprinkle pure ground coffee powder

45
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,280
onto the

46
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:04,319

antibacterial and antifungal compounds.

48
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,480
These compounds help prevent harmful

49
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,720
bacteria and fungi from entering the cut

50
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,200

51
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,200
rot and disease.

and strain out the coffee grounds.

63
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,840
Coffee contains natural compounds such

64
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:56,000
as chlorogenic acid and polyphenols

65
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,000
which have antibacterial and antifungal

66
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:06,520

Uh, soaking the orchid cutting in the

70

coffee solution helps prevent harmful

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,720
bacteria and fungi from entering the

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,960

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,080

orchid

78
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,800

Uh when you wipe the orchid leaves with

83
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,840
coffee water, these compounds help kill

84
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,919
bacteria, mold, and other pathogens,

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,919

rot.

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,520
