Hello everyone. It is such a joy and

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,680
happiness to welcome you to visit my

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,719
little lovely garden. A place where joy

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,679
and simple things are

5
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:14,400
nurtured. Today I would like to share

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,480
with you how to revive withering flower

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,039
buds and the secret to helping your

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,680
orchids bloom beautifully multiple times

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,439
a

10
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,359
year. You can see that although this

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,439
orchid of mine is blooming beautifully,

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,439
many flower buds have unexpectedly

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,439
withered.

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,800
There are many reasons that can lead to

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,160
this situation. Lack of water or

16
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,399
overwatering, excessive or insufficient

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,960
light, unstable temperature, using

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,640
inappropriate fertilizers, or the attack

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,840

20
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,800

and effective way.

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,199
First, remove all the rotten and

24
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,160
withered bud buds from the orchid to

25
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,160

38
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,680
Uh in addition to the English voiceover,

39
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,799
we have also prepared voiceovers in

40
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,439
French, German, Italian, Spanish,

understand the content more

44
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,600
easily. For the languages that do not

45
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,680
have a voiceover yet, we have added

46
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,320
subtitles so you can easily read and

47
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,320
understand the content.

48
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,120
Then trim off the flowers that have

49
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:45,319
wilted or rotted. This will help the

50
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,319
orchid recover and grow stronger.

51
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,959
Um, next we need to check the potting

52
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,120
medium and the condition of the orchid's

53
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,120
roots to ensure the plant is still

54
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,120
healthy.

55
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,280
Uh through the preliminary check, I

56
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:31,599
found that the potting medium and the

57
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,599
orchid's roots are still quite good and

58
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:46,000
healthy. Then I proceed to trim off the

59
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,000
damaged roots to help the orchid recover

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
better.

61
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,159
Trimming off the damaged roots helps the

62
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,080
orchid regenerate its vitality,

63
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,080
promoting the growth of new, healthy

64
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,959
roots. And this also helps improve the

65
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,959
plant's ability to absorb water and

66
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,959
nutrients.

[Music]

68
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,720
Next, remove the yellow and damaged

69
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,759
leaves so the orchid can focus its

70
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,759
energy on healthier growth.

72
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,320
As you can see, the black spots on the

73
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,560
yellow leaf stems and withered leaves

74
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,080
are where the disease clusters, waiting

75
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,440
for the opportunity to strike more

76
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,440
aggressively when the orchid is weak.

78
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,560
Therefore, removing these leaves is

79
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,639
crucial to prevent the spread of

80
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,639
diseases and help the orchid recover

81
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,639

83
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,160
After finishing the trimming, we will

84
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:59,320
proceed to make fertilizer to help the

85
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,320
orchid recover and grow stronger.

86
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,960
To make natural fertilizer, I will use

87
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,440
turmeric powder, a great ingredient that

88
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,000
not only helps revive the roots, but

89
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,759
also disinfects the potting medium,

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,240
creating a favorable environment for the

91
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,240
plant to

92
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,120
grow. Take one teaspoon of turmeric

93
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,720
powder, then mix it with one liter of

94
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,720
hot water and stir well.

96
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,599
Then let the mixture cool for a few

97
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,440
hours so The turmeric powder fully

98
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,440
dissolves into the in to the

99
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,440
water. Next, I use wheat flour as

100
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,360
fertilizer for the orchid. Um, providing

101
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,599
the necessary nutrients for the plant to

102
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,599
grow healthily.

103
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,080
Take one teaspoon of wheat flour. Then

104
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:38,520
mix it with one liter of room

105
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,520

106
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,680
Then let the mixture sit for a few hours

107
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,400
to allow the wheat flour to completely

108
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,400
dissolve in the water.

109
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,160
After the water cools, I proceed to

110
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,960
filter out the residue to obtain pure

111
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,960
turmeric water solution.

112
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,519
Filtering the turmeric water is an

113
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,360
important step to remove impurities,

114
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,080
making the solution pure and easier for

115
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,080
the orchid to absorb.

116
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,160
Uh once the filtration is complete, we

117
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,480
will proceed with the steps of caring

118
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,839

182
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,320
After replanting, we spray the mixture

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,519
better.

193
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,680
Spraying this mixture also helps wash

194
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,600
away dirt and impurities from the

195
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,600
leaves, keeping the orchid clean and

196
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,600
making it easier for the plant to absorb

197
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:43,360
nutrients. You should spray this mixture

198
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,440
one to two times a month to maintain the

199
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,120
orchid's health, help the plant grow

200
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,120
stronger, and effectively prevent

201
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,120
diseases.

202
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,959
After evenly spreading the turmeric and

203
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,399
flour mixture onto the orchid, we

204
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,519
continue by watering this mixture

205
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,519
directly onto the orchid's

206
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,800
roots. Watering helps the roots absorb

207
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,880
nutrients quickly, stimulates strong new

208
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,760
root growth, and also supports the

209
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,760
recovery of previous damage.

210
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,639
This is an important step to help the

211
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:26,399
orchid quickly regain its vitality and

212
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,399
continue growing healthily.

213
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:35,760
Uh you should perform this process

214
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,839
regularly one to two times a month to

215
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:41,880
maintain the orchid's health and keep it

216
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,880
lush and full of vitality.

217
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,639
Then use a soft cloth to gently blot the

218
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,560
water remaining on the leaf surfaces and

219
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,880
between the leaf joints to help the

220
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,279
leaves dry faster, reduce the risk of

221
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:03,240
fungal diseases, and keep the orchid

222
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,240
clean and healthy.

223
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,480
After wiping, you should place the

224
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:28,639
orchid pot in a spot with gentle

225
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,399
sunlight and good ventilation.

226
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,399
This helps the plant receive enough

227
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,120
light for photosynthesis without being

228
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,959
damaged by direct sunlight, thereby

229
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,360
supporting the orchid's recovery and

230
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,360
growth

231
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,720
optimally. Now, let's take a look at the

232
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:52,680
results after 3 weeks of caring for the

233
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,680
orchid with natural fertilizer.

234
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,240
As you can see, after 3 weeks of care

235
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,480
with natural fertilizer, many more

236
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,919
flowers have bloomed, bringing vibrant

237
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,839
beauty to the

238
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:12,720
orchid. Um, the remarkable recovery of

239
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,559
the plant with fresh new blooms is proof

240
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,400
of the great effectiveness of this care

241
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:21,160
method, helping the orchid not only stay

242
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,160
healthy, but also bloom continuously.

243
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:50,120
And the orchid has grown new very

244
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,120
healthy leaves.

245
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,880
Um, not only the flowers but the the

246
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,760
leaves have also become much sturdier

247
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,760
and greener than

248
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:06,799
before. The leaves not only look fresh

249
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,919
but also appear strong, promising a long

250
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,919
and beautiful blooming season.
