00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,240
Hello

2
00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:06,400
everyone. In today's video, we will

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,639
explore ways to care for weak orchids,

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,120
helping them revive and continue to

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,120
bloom

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,439
beautifully. If you're having trouble

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,359
caring for your orchids, don't worry.

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,480
These simple tips will help you bring

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,480
your plants back to

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,359
life. Let's get started.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,399
Uh, if you have a wilted orchid like

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,399
this, don't throw it

13
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:52,280
away. Now I share how to recover quickly

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,280
with natural fertilizers.

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,480
You see that the growing medium is very

16
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:15,560
dry. These are inorganic fertilizer

17
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,560
particles.

18
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,759
Check the roots for damage.

19
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:02,240
At the bottom of the orchid pot, there

20
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,240
are many inorganic fertilizer

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,960
particles. It seems orchids are not

22
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,960
suitable for inorganic fertilizers.

23
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,000
Many roots are damaged. So we need to

24
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,000
cut off all damaged

25
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,680
roots. When orchid roots are damaged,

26
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,400
bacteria, mold, or viruses can appear

27
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,400
and harm the plant.

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,519
Cutting off these damaged roots helps

29
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,640
prevent the spread of harmful pathogens

30
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,640
to other parts of the

31
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:07,400
plant. Leave only fresh roots like this.

32
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,159
Then cut off all damaged

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,480
leaves. Damaged orchid leaves can become

34
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,680
a breeding ground for bacteria, fungi,

35
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,280
or viruses. Removing these leaves helps

36
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,760
prevent the spread of diseases to other

37
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,760
parts of the plant.

38
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,040
When a plant has damaged leaves, it

39
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,120
expends energy to maintain these parts,

40
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,959
reducing the resources available for

41
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,879
other

42
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:54,640
growth. Removing damaged leaves helps

43
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,760
the plant conserve energy and focus on

44
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,760
developing new healthy leaves.

45
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,360
Then cut all the old flower branches.

46
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,280
After the flowers have faded, the old

47
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,680
flower stems no longer contribute to

48
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,680
nutrient

49
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,440
absorption. Removing the old stems

50
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,600
allows the plant to conserve energy and

51
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,479
focus on developing other parts such as

52
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,479
stronger roots and leaves.

53
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,759
Now you need to soak the entire orchid

54
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,400
in room temperature water for 1 hour.

55
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,320
This helps quickly restore wilted roots

56
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:53,000
and leaves, awakening the ability of

57
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,000
fresh roots and leaves to absorb water.

58
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,319
Take.5 L of

59
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,060
[Music]

60
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:30,039
water. Then add/ teaspoon brown sugar.

61
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,680
Sugar, mainly glucose, provides a quick

62
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,840
energy source for the plant, enhancing

63
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,080
photosynthesis and aiding in faster

64
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,880
recovery, especially when the plant is

65
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,120
wilting due to nutrient deficiency or

66
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,120
stress.

67
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:58,500
[Music]

68
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,639
after soaking in water for 1 hour. Take

69
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,639
the orchid

70
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:16,639
out and soak orchid leaves in water

71
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,639
mixed with brown sugar for 20 minutes.

72
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,800
At the same time, it also helps plants

73
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,800
recover and regenerate damaged parts

74
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,800
quickly.

75
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,800
Next, I need oatmeal.

76
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,120
Take one teaspoon of

77
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,560
oatmeal and add one spoon of wine

78
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,759
yeast. Add.5 L of warm water.

79
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,960
Oatmeal is a rich source of fiber and

80
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,120
essential nutrients like B vitamins,

81
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,840
amino acids, and minerals which help

82
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,840
orchids grow

83
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,599
strong. Wait 20

84
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,680
minutes. 20 minutes later.

85
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,440
Filter this water.

86
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,200
After soaking the orchid leaves for

87
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,200
about 20 minutes, take them

88
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,839
out. Then soak the entire orchid root in

89
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,920
yeast water and oatmeal for about 20

90
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,920
minutes. This will stimulate rapid root

91
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,920
growth.

92
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,309
[Music]

93
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,360
After soaking the roots for 20 minutes,

94
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,360
take the orchid

95
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,800
out. The roots absorb this nutrient and

96
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,800
turn

97
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:53,300
green. All standing water must be

98
00:09:50,240 --> 00:10:00,909
removed from the leaves before planting.

99

[Music]

100
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,600
Then plant the orchid in a pot so the

101
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,810
plant can grow in the outside

102
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,839
environment.

[Music]

104
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,040
I plant moss to help retain moisture so

105
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,040
the orchid can recover

great to have you

117
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:44,360
along. Then you mix these two waters

118
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,360
together.

119
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,079
Then you apply this liquid fertilizer to

120
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,079
your orchid pot and repeat after 10

121
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:35,079
days. This liquid fertilizer will

122
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,079
stimulate root growth very quickly.

123
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,760
Um, if you take advantage of this

124
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:06,839
remaining liquid fertilizer to fertilize

125
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,839
other orchids, it will be very good.

126
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,200
New roots will grow very quickly.

127
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,279
The new root system of this weak orchid

128
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,600
has grown very strongly thanks to this

129
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,600
liquid

130
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,279
fertilizer. Every time you take care of

131
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,519
orchids, soak the orchid pot in this

132
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,720
fertilizer solution for about 20 minutes

133
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,720
and then take it out.

134
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,560
Then place the orchid pot in a place

135
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:08,079
with lots of light and fertilize with

136
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,079
liquid fertilizer every 10

137
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,760
days. Results after 1

138
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,880
month. Orchids develop many new very

139
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,880

[Music]

141
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:41,480
roots. This will help the orchid recover

142
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,480
faster.

143
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,839
When the roots absorb water, the wilted

144
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,839
leaves will gradually

145
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:13,560
recover. Then continue to apply this

146
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,560
liquid fertilizer every 10 days. Then

147
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:54,559

148
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,279
results. After the next 3

149
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:08,079
months, the orchid has recovered and

150
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,079
grown very well

151
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:15,120

154
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,680
Take care of your orchids with all the

155
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,399
love and care you have for plants, and

156
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,399
you will be

157
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,240
rewarded. When you invest time and

158
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,839
attention into every small detail, the

159
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:14,120
plant will sense it and respond with

160
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,120
vibrant, healthy blooms.

161
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,039
Orchids are not just beautiful plants,

162
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:28,079
but a testament to love, patience, and

163
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:30,640
meticulous care. Let them thrive in an

164
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,160
environment full of attention and love,

165
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,840
and you'll see your orchids not only

166
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,840
grow strong, but bloom beautifully.
