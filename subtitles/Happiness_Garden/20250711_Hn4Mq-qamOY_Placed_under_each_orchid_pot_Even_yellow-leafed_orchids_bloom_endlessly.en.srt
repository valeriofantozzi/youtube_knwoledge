00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,360
weak orchids until they recover and

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,120

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,320
Uh, this is an orchid that has rotted

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,200
and usually people throw it away

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:35,200
thinking it can no longer recover.

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,399
This orchid has had all its upper leaves

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,239
rot away, leaving only one small leaf

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,530
near the base that is still fresh and

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:54,130

[Music]

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,640
Rotting orchids often start from

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,120
waterlogged roots which allow fungal

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,879
diseases to easily develop and spread

23
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,040
gradually causing the entire plant to

24
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,040
rot.

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,880
And this orchid is no exception. It

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,320
rotted because the roots had been water

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,560
logged for a long time.

28
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,200
To check whether the roots are rotten,

29
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,600
uh simply squeeze them gently. If the

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,240
roots feel soft and hollow inside, it's

31
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,159
a sign of rot. On the other hand, if

32
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,500
they are still firm and solid, it means

33
00:01:24,159 --> 00:02:05,480
the roots are healthy.

35
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,879
Because many of the roots are water

36
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,280
logged and rotten, the growing medium is

37
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,760
no longer suitable. Therefore, we need

38
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,490
to completely remove the old medium to

39
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:31,760

The next ingredient I've chosen to make

211
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,160
not be too large as this can cause water

gaps between the roots, but don't pack

You can spread a thin layer of moss on
