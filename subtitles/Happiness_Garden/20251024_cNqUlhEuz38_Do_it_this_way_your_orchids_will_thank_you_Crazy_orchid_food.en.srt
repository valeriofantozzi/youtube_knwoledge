00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,480
Welcome to the Happiness Garden channel.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,720
In today's video, I will continue to

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,519
share a new method that helps blooms

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,000
that have already opened to revive and

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,080
bloom again. You will see that with just

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,080
a few simple steps, your orchid [music]

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,640
can still maintain its vitality and

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:22,160
brilliant beauty after each flowering.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,080

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,440
orchid growing tips. It's wonderful to

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,559
have you along.

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,399
[music]

15
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,399
So, let's start exploring together right

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,399
now.

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,280
These [music] are the blooms after the

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,760
petals have fallen. You can see that the

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,440
plant still retains its vitality inside,

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,440
and we can definitely [music] help it

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,440
revive.

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,440
The buds on the branch that haven't

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,760
bloomed are still sleeping [music]

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,359
inside and can definitely be awakened to

25
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,359
bloom again if you know how to care for

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,359
them.

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,840
The blooms that have opened should be

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,600
removed so that the [music] nutrients

29
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,640
can focus on helping the remaining

30
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,320
sleeping buds grow. In this way, the

31
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,880
plant will have more chances to produce

32
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,880
many new flowers.

33
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,520
Then sprinkle a little cinnamon powder

34
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,680
on the cut, [music] helping the wound

35
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,679
heal quickly because cinnamon has

36
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,360
antibacterial properties and prevents

37
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,360
mold.

38
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,200
Thanks to this, the plant will recover

39
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,480
quickly and focus [music] its nutrients

40
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,480
on the remaining buds to grow.

41
00:02:29,996 --> 00:02:32,016
[music]

42
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,000
Then leave the plant alone for 1 day

43
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,201
without watering until the cut is

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,360
completely dry.

45
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:39,680
>> [music]

46
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:44,280
>> This helps the wound heal faster and

47
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,280
prevents harmful diseases from entering.

48
00:02:45,716 --> 00:02:49,519
[music] Um to stimulate the orchid to

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
grow new buds from the dormant eyes on

50
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,680
the branch, I will use a small onion and

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,680
cut it into thin slices.

52
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,319
Onions contain growth stimulating

53
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,319
compounds such as oxin, cytoinine, and

54
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,879
many other nutrients, helping the orchid

55
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,959
branch quickly sprout buds. Thanks to

56
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,640
these compounds, the sleeping buds will

57
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,317
be awakened and get ready to bloom

58
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,317
again. [music]

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,157
Then place the onion slices into a clean

60
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,177
jar.

61
00:03:17,157 --> 00:03:19,177
[music]

62
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,319
The next ingredient is eggshells. Take

63
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,319
two eggshells that have been dried,

64
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,800
sterilized, and ground into a fine

65
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,120
powder. This eggshell powder will

66
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,959
provide calcium and essential minerals

67
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,200
supporting the orchid to develop healthy

68
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,200
new buds.

69
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:42,757
[laughter]

70
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:46,687
[snorts]

71
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,840
Next, add the eggshell powder into the

72
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,840
jar with the onion.

73
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,280
Then pour the mixture into one liter of

74
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,919
boiling water and let [music] it steep

75
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,320
until the water is completely cool. This

76
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,240
process helps extract the nutrients from

77
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,240
the onion and eggshells, creating a

78
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,240
natural nutrient solution for the orchid

79
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,240
branch.

80
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,800
Uh please comment and you know let me

81
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,000
know which country you are watching the

82
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,160
video from. [music]

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,273
It's wonderful that we can connect and

84
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,400
chat together from all around the world.

85
00:04:44,273 --> 00:04:46,720
>> [music]

86
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,600
>> Um, when the water has cooled, strain

87
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,440
the mixture to remove the sediment. Only

88
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,280
use the clear solution to water the

89
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,199
orchid [music] branch, ensuring the

90
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,360
nutrients are absorbed effectively by

91
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,360
the plant.

92
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,120
Uh, step one, water this natural

93
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,280
fertilizer mixture directly onto the

94
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,680
roots and growing medium. two to three

95
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,199
times per month. Doing this regularly

96
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,360
will help the plant absorb nutrients

97
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,600
well and stimulate the sleeping buds to

98
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,600
grow vigorously.

99
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,320
Step two, put the mixture into a spray

100
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,560
bottle and spray evenly over all the

101
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,560
roots, stem, and leaves of the plant.

102
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,240
Um, this method helps the nutrients

103
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,479
penetrate [music] evenly, nourishing the

104
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,919
plant from the inside out and supporting

105
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,919
the sleeping buds to [music] grow

106
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,919
quickly.

107
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,160
Spray the mixture gently, allowing the

108
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,160
solution to soak evenly throughout the

109
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,639
plant. Don't forget to spray [music]

110
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:13,039
both the top and underside of the leaves

111
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:15,440
so the nutrients are absorbed optimally.

112
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,960
Do this two to three times per month to

113
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,440
directly supplement [music] nutrients

114
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,360
through the leaves. At the same time,

115
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,520
this method also helps repel harmful

116
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,720
insects and increases the plant's

117
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,720
resistance [music] to pests and

118
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,720
diseases.

119
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,600
Step three, [music] wrap cotton around

120
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,600
the sleeping buds. Then spray the

121
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,800
natural fertilizer mixture directly onto

122
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,440
the cotton to stimulate [music]

123
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,120
blooming. This method helps concentrate

124
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,560
the nutrients on the buds, increasing

125
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,199
the chances [music] of them bursting

126
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,199
into vibrant flowers.

127
00:06:51,999 --> 00:06:54,019
[music]

128
00:06:59,204 --> 00:07:01,224
>> [music]

129
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,049
[music]

130
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,770
[music]

131
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,759
>> Now spray the fertilizer mixture onto

132
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,160
these cotton pieces. The solution will

133
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,680
soak into the sleeping buds, softening

134
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,639
and awakening them, [music] preparing

135
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,639
for the blooming process.

136
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,879
Do this two to three times per month and

137
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,520
keep keep the cotton on the sleeping

138
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,919
buds for about 30 minutes. This helps

139
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,080
the fertilizer mixture [music] penetrate

140
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,840
deep into the buds, stimulating them to

141
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,840
grow and prepare for blooming.

142
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:27,240
After letting the cotton sit for about

143
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,240
30 minutes, gently remove it.

144
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:40,785
[music]

145
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,600
At the same time, also take the orchid

146
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,936
pot out of the fertilizer mixture and

147
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,000
place it in a spot with gentle sunlight.

148
00:08:47,936 --> 00:08:51,920
[music] Remember to do this regularly

149
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,920
two to three times per month so the

150
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:58,120
plant absorbs nutrients well [music] and

151
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,120
the sleeping buds grow vigorously.

152
00:09:04,966 --> 00:09:09,760
[music] And here are the results after 6

153
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,600
weeks of recovery care. You can see many

154
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,080
new flower spikes emerging from the

155
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,080
sleeping buds on the old orchid branch,

156
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,080
proving that this care method is truly

157
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,080

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,200
Thank you all for watching. Goodbye and

191
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,000
wishing [music] you a beautiful day full

192
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,480
of joy and vibrant orchid blooms. See

193
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,480
you in [music] the next video.

194
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:25,480
Welcome to part two of today's video on

195
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,480
the Happiness Garden channel.

196
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,240
In this video, I will share a simple way

197
00:11:30,377 --> 00:11:34,399
[music] to help a sick orchid recover

198
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,040
quickly while also stimulating the plant

199
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,892
to produce many keis at the same time.

200
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,480
Thanks to that, in one orchid pot,

201
00:11:38,892 --> 00:11:42,240
[music] you will see many young plants

202
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,160
growing together, bringing a brilliant

203
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,160
blooming season with lots of [music]

204
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,160
flowers.

205
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,839
Let's get started.

206
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,320
This is an [music] orchid suffering from

207
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,320
rot mainly caused by the attack of fungi

208
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,880
and bacteria [music] which damage and

209
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,880
weaken the leaves.

210
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,399
If rot is not treated in time, [music]

211
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,279
it will quickly spread and can cause the

212
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,279
entire orchid to die.

213
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,399
>> [music]

214
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,480
>> Uh please comment and let me know which

215
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,160
country you are watching the video from.

216
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,440
It's wonderful that we can connect and

217
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,433
chat [music] from all over the world.

218
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,519
The rotten parts after being removed

219
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:27,440
[music] need to be carefully disinfected

220
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:31,720
or destroyed far from the garden to

221
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,720
avoid spreading to other plants.

222
00:12:33,258 --> 00:12:35,680
>> [music]

223
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,920
>> Um, I need to check the roots because

224
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,279
when an orchid rots, it is often due to

225
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,200
water logging in the roots, [music]

226
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,393
which causes root suffocation and

227
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,240
gradual weakening of the plant.

228
00:12:44,393 --> 00:12:47,920
[music]

229
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,680
It is necessary to cut off all the

230
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,959
damaged roots, helping the orchid avoid

231
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,959
the spread of pathogens [music]

232
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:56,519
and creating conditions for new healthy

233
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,519
roots to grow.

234
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,600
If you [music] haven't subscribed to the

235
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,519
channel yet, click the subscribe button

236
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,680
to support me and not miss any orchid

237
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:09,399
growing tips. It's wonderful to have you

238
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,399
along for the journey.

239
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,120
After that, [music] wash the orchid

240
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,880
thoroughly with water to completely

241
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,880
remove any remaining bacteria and fungi.

242
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,200
>> [music]

243
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,880
>> Next, prepare four cups of water,

244
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:33,160
approximately one liter, to proceed with

245
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,160
the next care step for the orchid.

246
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:47,360
Then [music] add five tablets of vitamin

247
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,360
B1, each 2.5 mg. Vitamin B1 helps the

248
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,399
orchid recover quickly, stimulates new

249
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,399
root growth, and [music] boosts

250
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,399
resistance.

251
00:13:57,099 --> 00:13:59,119
[music]

252
00:14:02,994 --> 00:14:06,320
[music]

253
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,440
Next, take an aloe vera leaf and cut it

254
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,360
into thin slices. Aloe vera is rich in

255
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,720
nutrients, very good for restoring weak

256
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,439
orchids and helping the roots grow

257
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,240
quickly.

258
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:18,079
>> [music]

259
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,000
>> Add the aloe vera slices together with

260
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,600
the vitamin B1 to create a nutrient

261
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,199
mixture that helps the orchid recover

262
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,199
quickly and stimulates root growth.

263
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,320
Then wait about 30 minutes for the

264
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,839
nutrients to fully dissolve in the

265
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,320
water, ready for [music] the next care

266
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,320
step for the orchid.

267
00:14:39,675 --> 00:14:41,695
>> [music]

268
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,440
>> Then strain the water to remove the

269
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:49,880
residue, keeping [music] only the

270
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,880
nutrient-rich solution for the orchid.

271
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,399
Then use this solution to soak the

272
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,440
orchid's roots for about 20 minutes,

273
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,279
helping [music] the roots absorb

274
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,160
nutrients, recover quite quickly, and

275
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,160
stimulate healthy growth.

276
00:15:21,595 --> 00:15:25,680
[music]

277
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,519
I chose crushed pine bark as the growing

278
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,519
medium because it helps maintain just

279
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:33,320
the right moisture and [music] ensures

280
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,320
good drainage for the orchid.

281
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,120
Then [music] gently place the orchid

282
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,959
into the growing medium, keeping the

283
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,680
roots comfortable and free from bending

284
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,760
or damage.

285
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,600
The white beads are resin beads used in

286
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,519
hydroponic [music] gardening. When mixed

287
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,279
with crushed pine bark, they help

288
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,680
increase irration for the orchid [music]

289
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:56,000
roots.

290
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,759
Finally, add a thin layer of moss on top

291
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,279
to retain moisture and create a good

292
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,605
environment for the orchid roots to

293
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,605
grow. [music]

294
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,720
Then take [music] cotton balls and soak

295
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,959
them in the vitamin B1 and aloe vera

296
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,959
mixture. Then use them to wrap the

297
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,480
orchid's [music] roots, helping retain

298
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:22,839
moisture and allowing the roots to

299
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,839
absorb nutrients and recover quickly.

300
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:40,251
>> [music]

301
00:16:46,091 --> 00:16:49,600
[music]

302
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,440
>> Wrap for one day and then remove. This

303
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,006
helps stimulate the roots and new shoots

304
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,006
to grow quickly. [music]

305
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,480
Then pour the nutrient mixture into a

306
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,639
spray bottle for easy application onto

307
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,639
the orchid.

308
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,720
From now on, spray this solution onto

309
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,720
the leaves, roots, and growing medium of

310
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,000
the orchid once a week to help the plant

311
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,919
stay healthy and [music] grow well.

312
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,461
Or you can also pour this mixture

313
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,600
directly onto the roots and growing

314
00:17:21,461 --> 00:17:25,600
[music] medium, helping the orchid

315
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,011
absorb nutrients faster and grow

316
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,032
healthily.

317
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:30,032
[music]

318
00:17:32,597 --> 00:17:35,440
>> [music]

319
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,679
>> Then place the orchid pot in a cool area

320
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,760
with sufficient light, allowing the

321
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,919
plant to stabilize and adapt well to the

322
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,919
new [music] environment.

323
00:17:47,662 --> 00:17:50,880
[music]

324
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,720
After one day, remove the cotton from

325
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,177
the orchid's roots, allowing the roots

326
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,197
to continue growing normally.

327
00:17:56,177 --> 00:17:58,197
[music]

328
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,679
Then take a transparent plastic [music]

329
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,520
box and place it over the plant like a

330
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:09,160
mini greenhouse to retain moisture and

331
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,160
protect the young [music] orchid.

332
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,480
Uh place the orchid pot in a cool, airy

333
00:18:15,172 --> 00:18:18,880
[music] spot with gentle sunlight,

334
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,412
preferably morning eastacing sun, so the

335
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,960
plant can photosynthesize effectively

336
00:18:20,412 --> 00:18:24,240
[music]

337
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,240
and synthesize nutrients well.

338
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,480
Continue spraying the aloe vera and

339
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,720
vitamin B1 mixture onto the plant once a

340
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:34,360
week to help the orchid grow healthily

341
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,360
and recover quickly.

342
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,880
Or you can pour this mixture directly

343
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,400
onto the orchid [music] once a week,

344
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,640
helping the plant absorb nutrients and

345
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,640
grow healthily.

346
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,520
Remember to place the orchid pot in a

347
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,360
spot with [music] gentle sunlight so the

348
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,679
plant can photosynthesize well and

roots and leaves [music] grow healthily.

351
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,080
And here is the result. After 1 month of

352
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,080
care and recovery using the vitamin B1

353
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,000
and aloe vera mixture, [music] the

354
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,000
orchid grows healthily and blooms

355
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
beautifully.

356
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,679
You can see that the orchid has grown

357
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,440
two shoots on [music] both sides which

358
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:31,160
shows that the plant is recovering well

359
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,160
and growing vigorously.

360
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:34,483
[music]

361
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,200
Continue spraying the aloe vera and

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,640
growth.

365
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,698
Or you can pour this mixture directly

366
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,160
onto the roots and growing medium,

367
00:19:56,698 --> 00:20:02,440
[music] helping the orchid absorb

368
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,440
nutrients quickly and grow healthily.

369
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,160
And remember to place the orchid [music]

370
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,240
pot in a spot with gentle sunlight so

371
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:16,200

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,200
absorb nutrients effectively.

373
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,919
And here is the result after another

374
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,919
month.

375
