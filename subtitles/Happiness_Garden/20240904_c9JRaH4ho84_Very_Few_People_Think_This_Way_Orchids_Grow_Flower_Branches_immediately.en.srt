welcome to my channel

00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,783
Today I would like to introduce to you an interesting video on how to use carrots

3
00:00:28,868 --> 00:00:31,710
help orchids bloom many times a year

4
00:00:31,813 --> 00:00:36,981
There are many people who are passionate about growing orchids and want them to always bloom and stay lush wherever they are.

5
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,142
However, sometimes you have a situation where your orchid doesn't bloom

6
00:00:40,227 --> 00:00:42,227
or slow flowering.

7
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,329
make orchid growers feel disappointed

8
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:48,111
But don't worry, because in the video you will be shown how to help orchids bloom several times a year.

9
00:00:50,072 --> 00:00:55,460
Carrots are not only a nutritious dish, but also a simple and effective solution to this problem

10
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:03,804
With just a few simple steps as shown in the video, you can stimulate flowers to bloom quickly

11
00:01:03,804 --> 00:01:18,378
So watch the video and learn how to use the carrot tool to

12
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:27,907
help your orchid bloom instantly and bloom many times a year.

13
00:01:27,907 --> 00:01:34,517
Use the peel of 1 carrot,

14
00:01:34,517 --> 00:01:41,634
add 10 grams of fresh ginger,

15
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:46,257
add 1 liter of water

16
00:01:46,257 --> 00:01:50,133
puree

17
00:02:05,257 --> 00:02:19,336
Leave in a dark place for 6 hours

18
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:31,928
After incubation for 6 hours

19
00:02:43,505 --> 00:02:53,134
filter out residue

20
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:14,934
Add water to make 4 liters of solution

21
00:03:16,765 --> 00:03:25,559
now irrigate this way,

22
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:33,686
Soak orchid root in carrot juice for about 5 minutes

23
00:03:33,686 --> 00:03:42,918
This will make it easier for the roots to absorb nutrients.

24
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:57,959
and repeat this once a month

25
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:09,575
Carrots contain many vitamins, amino acids and minerals such as:

26
00:04:09,575 --> 00:04:22,340
protein, phosphorus and lots of potassium.

27
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:36,069
The nutrients and vitamins in carrots will help orchids grow better,

28
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:50,885
Increase the resistance and vitality of plants,

29
00:04:50,885 --> 00:05:01,734
help it easily adapt to the living environment.

30
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:18,901
In addition, watering plants from carrots also helps to increase the humidity of the surrounding environment,

31
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:32,678
help orchids have better growing conditions.

32
00:05:32,678 --> 00:05:49,994
The natural sugar and potassium content in carrots makes it easier for orchids to absorb

33
00:05:49,994 --> 00:06:11,663
Potassium and sugar stimulate flower growth very quickly

34
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:27,224
It also helps orchids tolerate drought very well

35
00:06:27,224 --> 00:06:32,847
so that the flowers don't fall

36
00:06:32,847 --> 00:06:40,941
and lots of buds

37
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:55,331
As you can see this orchid has 5-6 flower branches

38
00:06:55,331 --> 00:07:09,714
However, to help orchids bloom all year round, it is necessary to create suitable environmental conditions such as:

39
00:07:09,714 --> 00:07:17,455
the right light, the right humidity, and the right wind

40
00:07:17,455 --> 00:07:23,361
You should also not overuse the use of carrots.

41
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:33,451
because it will make the orchid have a disorder in nutrient absorption,

42
00:07:33,451 --> 00:07:38,414
it will not benefit the orchids,

43
00:07:38,414 --> 00:07:44,259
Best to only apply once a month

44
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:50,110
and need to combine the use of other organic fertilizers such as fish protein, soy protein

45
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:54,923
and pea protein fertilizer like the video I guide to take care of

46
00:07:54,923 --> 00:07:58,084
so orchids will grow and bloom all year round

47
00:07:58,084 --> 00:08:01,434
Thank you for watching the video! Good luck
