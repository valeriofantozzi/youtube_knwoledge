29
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,520
First, let's check the roots of the

30
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,759
plant. Healthy roots are usually white

31
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,439
or light green and firm, while damaged

32
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,200
roots are brown, black, or mushy.

33
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,119
You should carefully use scissors or

34
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,240
pruning shears to trim off any rotten

35
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,240
roots to prevent the spread of disease.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,520
Cutting off the damaged roots helps the

37
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,600
plant focus its energy on developing new

38
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,980
roots, absorb nutrients more

39
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:10,080
effectively, and recover more quickly.

plant no longer needs to supply

43
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,040
nutrients to the nonfunctional parts. As

44
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,890
a result, new roots will grow stronger

45
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:26,640
and absorb nutrients more effectively.

When they are removed, this the space

50
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,879
around the base of the plant becomes

51
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,250

I use pine bark to grow orchids because
