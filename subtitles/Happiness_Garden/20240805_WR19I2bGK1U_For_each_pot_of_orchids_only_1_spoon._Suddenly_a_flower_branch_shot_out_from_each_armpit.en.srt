Hello friends

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,366
Today I will show you how when we need to water the orchid

3
00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:11,298
When the orchid's roots are green like this, the orchid has enough water

4
00:00:11,298 --> 00:00:17,238
The leaves will be green and sturdy

5
00:00:26,501 --> 00:00:31,366
But if the roots turn white, the plant is lacking water

6
00:00:31,366 --> 00:00:35,303
check the potting medium you will find it very dry

7
00:00:35,303 --> 00:00:41,917
Leaves will wilt very quickly if we don't water them in time

8
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:50,060
In this case, we need to quickly water the orchid

9
00:00:52,901 --> 00:00:56,444
HOW TO WATER AS FOLLOWING:

10
00:00:56,444 --> 00:01:02,994
Place the orchid pot in a deep dish and water the substrate completely

11
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:47,803
If the roots are still fresh but the leaves are wilted, we can soak the orchid in water for 20-30 minutes

12
00:01:56,366 --> 00:02:01,343
With pots using moss growing medium, the ability to retain moisture is very good,

13
00:02:01,343 --> 00:02:05,291
so we only need to water enough moisture.

14
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:09,388
and no need to soak.

15
00:02:13,905 --> 00:02:19,073
Eat bananas, don't throw away the peels

16
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:24,404
Banana peel contains a lot of vitamins and minerals:

17
00:02:24,404 --> 00:02:29,020
vitamins A, B, C, E and protein, phosphorus, especially rich in potassium.

18
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:36,334
Potassium resists drought very well, helps the orchid to transport water from the root to the top, so the orchid does not wilt

19
00:02:36,334 --> 00:02:43,062
At the same time, potassium helps to stimulate flower growth and keep flowers fresh for a long time

20
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:04,439
We cut banana peels

21
00:03:08,683 --> 00:03:14,600
Put all banana peels in a jar and pour 500ml of boiled water

22
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,784
Then incubate for 1 day for the nutrients to dissolve into the water

23
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:46,507
5 vitamin b1 tablets mixed with 500ml of filtered water

24
00:03:46,507 --> 00:03:52,433
B1 helps plants to better absorb nutrients

25
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:56,179
and growth regulator

26
00:03:56,179 --> 00:04:00,888
It also stimulates root growth very well

27
00:04:04,038 --> 00:04:12,649
After 1 day of incubation, we mix banana juice with vitamin B1 water to get 1 liter of synthetic organic fertilizer solution.

28
00:04:36,618 --> 00:04:41,611
Divide into a spray bottle

29
00:04:53,118 --> 00:04:58,108
Spray the top and bottom of the leaves evenly

30
00:04:58,108 --> 00:05:06,763
Orchid plants are provided with a part of nutrients that are supplemented through the leaves

31
00:05:06,763 --> 00:05:15,486
At the same time, it also eliminates insects to help the orchid stay green

32
00:05:22,246 --> 00:05:29,616
You can also use a cotton ball soaked in this synthetic organic fertilizer solution to wipe the leaves

33
00:05:29,616 --> 00:05:37,535
Do this 1-2 times a month, the orchid will always be protected and green

34
00:05:58,147 --> 00:06:05,128
Next, you use this liquid synthetic organic fertilizer solution to irrigate the orchid

35
00:06:05,128 --> 00:06:12,964
do 1-2 times a month and combine with other organic fertilizers that I have shared on the channel

36
00:06:12,964 --> 00:06:21,252
It will help orchids easily absorb nutrients

37
00:06:21,252 --> 00:06:27,026
Vitamin B1 helps stimulate root growth

38
00:06:27,026 --> 00:06:33,489
Potassium in banana juice will stimulate flower growth and help flowers stay fresh for a long time

39
00:06:33,489 --> 00:06:39,574
It is truly the perfect formula for the full development of roots, leaves and flowers

40
00:06:39,574 --> 00:06:46,469
It's very good, but you should not overdo it, it will harm the orchid

41
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:54,170
You should only fertilize according to my instructions so that your orchid garden always blooms without affecting the growth of orchids.

42
00:06:56,774 --> 00:07:04,815

49
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:13,874
Welcome to part 3 of the video

50
00:16:13,874 --> 00:16:18,873
To easily care for orchids to always grow healthily.

51
00:16:18,873 --> 00:16:25,872
A healthy root system helps absorb the most nutrients.

52
00:16:25,872 --> 00:16:32,871
and have more flower buds, flowers stay on the branches longer.

53
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:40,869
These are coffee grounds.

54
00:16:41,869 --> 00:16:52,900
I took about 50 grams of coffee grounds and put them in a jar

55
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:06,897
When eating bananas, don't throw away the peel.

56
00:17:07,897 --> 00:17:15,896
Because banana peels contain many nutrients, especially organic potassium.

57
00:17:16,895 --> 00:17:24,894
Very good for the growth of buds, flowers and has anti-drought effects.

58
00:17:26,893 --> 00:17:35,892
I cut the banana peel thinly and put it in a jar.

59
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:50,889
Then add 3 tablespoons of sugar.

60
00:17:50,889 --> 00:17:56,887
Sugar helps nourish beneficial microorganisms.

61
00:17:58,887 --> 00:18:08,885
and add 3 tablespoons of dry yeast to help decompose organic matter quickly and not rot.

62
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:21,882
And add 1 liter of warm water.

63
00:18:24,882 --> 00:18:34,880
Warm water helps beneficial microorganisms grow and ferment faster than cold water.

64
00:18:38,879 --> 00:18:46,878
Then place in a cool place for 21 days to let the organic matter decompose before using.

65
00:18:53,876 --> 00:19:03,874
with orchids with wilted leaves and slow growth.

66
00:19:03,874 --> 00:19:13,872
I take care of it with organic fertilizer from coffee grounds and banana peels and it will be very good.

67
00:19:20,871 --> 00:19:30,869
Checking the roots, I found that this orchid had many damaged roots underneath.

68
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:39,867
The cause may be that the growing medium is moldy and dry.

69
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:50,865
All damaged roots need to be removed.

70
00:19:54,864 --> 00:20:02,863
Then rinse with water.

71
00:20:07,862 --> 00:20:16,860
I replanted the orchid with a more porous growing medium, which helps retain moisture better.

72
00:20:36,856 --> 00:20:44,888
After composting, the compost ferments so there is a white scum on top.

73
00:20:46,887 --> 00:20:56,885
I took 50ml of this organic nutrient.

74
00:21:10,882 --> 00:21:19,881
Mix with 3 liters of water.

75
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,880
Step 1

76
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:37,877
Wiping the top and bottom of leaves with this water helps kill fungi and insects that harm orchids.

77
00:21:42,876 --> 00:21:52,874
Do this every 2 weeks to protect your orchids.

78
00:21:59,873 --> 00:22:02,872
Step 2

79
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:16,869
Use this water to spray the leaves once a week.

80
00:22:19,869 --> 00:22:27,867
Helps supplement nutrients through leaves very effectively.

81
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:39,898
Helps leaves recover quickly, orchid leaves will be strong and healthy quickly

82
00:22:40,898 --> 00:22:42,898
Step 3

83
00:22:43,897 --> 00:22:51,896
Water each orchid pot with this water once a week.

84
00:22:54,895 --> 00:23:02,894
This fertilizer provides potassium, an important mineral that improves plant health and vitality.

85
00:23:03,893 --> 00:23:12,892
The beneficial fungus Mycorrhiza will grow to help the plant more easily absorb nutrients from the orchid growing medium.

86
00:23:13,891 --> 00:23:21,890
Soak in this water for 10 minutes then take out.

87
00:23:24,889 --> 00:23:34,887
Place in a cool place with enough light for the orchid to recover.

88
00:23:39,886 --> 00:23:42,886
2 MONTHS LATER

89
00:23:48,884 --> 00:23:56,883
Many new roots develop to help the orchid absorb nutrients better.

90
00:23:58,882 --> 00:24:08,880
When the roots absorb enough water and nutrients, the orchid will recover faster.

91
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:17,879
Thanks to that, the leaves have completely recovered and are no longer wilted.

92
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:29,876
I continue to wash the leaves with this water once a week.

93
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:45,873
Then continue to spray this water on the orchid once a week.

94
00:24:51,872 --> 00:25:01,870
and continue watering and soaking the roots once a week with this water.

95
00:25:35,897 --> 00:25:37,896
After the next 2 months.

96
00:25:39,896 --> 00:25:49,894
The orchid has completely recovered and is growing very strongly.

97
00:25:54,893 --> 00:26:04,891
It blooms many flower buds.

98
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:19,888
Roots grow very healthy.

99
00:26:22,887 --> 00:26:31,886
