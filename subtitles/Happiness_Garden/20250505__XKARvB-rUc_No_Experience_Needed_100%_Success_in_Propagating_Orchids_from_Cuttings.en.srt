00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,400
Welcome to my little garden where orchid

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,600
branches begin a new

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,080
journey. Today I will show you how to

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,300
propagate orchids from cutings. Simple

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,040
and effective right at

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,119
[Music]

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:20,520
home. This is my orchid. It it has

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:23,359
finished blooming and is ready for

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,960
propagation. When the petals fade, it's

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,600
the perfect time to start propagating

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,600
orchids from cutings.

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,399
Cut off any damaged leaves so the plant

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,399
can grow

14
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:39,680
stronger. Cutting off damaged leaves

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,280
helps eliminate fungi, prevents the

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,280
spread of disease, and keeps the plant

17
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:50,920
healthy. Next, trim off any damaged

18
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,920
roots to ensure the plant grows well.

19
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,160
[Music]

20
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,160
Uh, trimming off damaged roots helps

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,770
prevent mold growth and creates

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,760
conditions for new healthy roots to

23
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:07,760
[Music]

24
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,920
grow. Uh, identifying damaged roots is

25
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,080
simple. If the roots are soft, they are

26
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,640
completely damaged. If the roots are

27
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,920
still firm but have a dark brown color,

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,920
it is also a sign of damage.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,240
Please comment and let me know which

30
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,320
country you're watching the video from.

31
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,870
It's amazing that we can chat together

32
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,079
from all over the

38
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,520
wonderful to have you as a companion.

39
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,960
Next, trim off the faded petals. This

40
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,200
helps the plant conserve energy and get

41
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,119
ready for the next blooming cycle or for

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,680
producing baby plants on the stem if

43
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,680
properly stimulated.

44
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,079
[Music]

45
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,640
The nodes that have already bloomed will

46
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,319
not bloom again and cannot produce baby

47
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,319
plants for baby from

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,520
there. Young nodes like this should not

49
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,959
be used for propagation as the dormant

50
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,959
buds are prone to rotting and damage.

51
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,840
Old nodes like this should also not be

52
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,239
used for propagation as the dormant buds

53
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,760
are very hard to

54
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,239
develop. This node is neither too old

55
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,360
nor too young making it the ideal choice

56
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,360
for propagation from cutings.

57
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,040
Um, peeling off the protective layer of

58
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,800
the dormant bud helps nutrients absorb

59
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,840
better when stimulated, allowing the

60
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,840
baby plant to sprout quickly.

61
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,920
In addition to the English voiceover, uh

62
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,239
we have now created voiceovers in

63
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,480
French, German, Italian, Spanish,

64
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,640
Portuguese, Japanese, Hindi, and

65
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,120

66
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,560
understand the content more easily. To

67
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,879
listen to the language, open the video

68
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,760
and click settings gear icon to select

69
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,760
the appropriate audio language.

[Music]

71
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,000
For languages without voice over, we

72
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,280
have created subtitles to help you

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,280
easily read and understand the

74
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:09,760
content. Bananas when made into GE gel

75
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,599
enzyme are very effective in orchid

76
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,720
propagation from cutings, helping to

77
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,759
stimulate rapid growth.

78
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,359
Bananas when made into GE gel enzyme are

79
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,600
very effective in orchid propagation

80
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,600
from cutings helping to stimulate rapid

81
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:30,400
growth. Uh next take a pieces of gin to

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
make GE which helps enhance growth and

83
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,000
fight diseases during the propagation

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
process.

85
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,080
Then place the sliced banana and ginger

86
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,720
into a glass or plastic jar to prepare

87
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,720
for making

88
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,199
GE. Make sure the jar is clean so that

89
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,800
when the GE fermentss, uh, the mixture

90
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,800
doesn't spoil and maintains its

91
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,240
quality. Next, add.5 L of water to make

92
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,960
it easier for the mixture to dissolve

93
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,960
and ferment effectively.

94
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,609
[Music]

95
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,199
uh leave some space in the jar so that

96
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,360
when it ferments the GE will produce gas

97
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,639
and allow the fermentation process to

98
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,479
proceed

99
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:36,320
smoothly. Finally, add about 2 tesp of

100
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:40,199
honey to boost nutrients and stimulate

101
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,199
the fermentation process.

102
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,639
Stir the mixture well so that the

103
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,639
ingredients blend together and ferment

104
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,520
easily.

105
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:12,800
Close the lid and place it in a cool,

106
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,120
airy spot for 3 weeks. The mixture will

107
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,960
ferment and turn into a highly effective

108
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,960
GE for orchid propagation from

109
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,880
cutings. This is the GE product I made

110
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,960
earlier. Now all you need to do is take

111
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,000
it out and apply it for orchid

112
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,000
propagation from

113
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:55,720
cutings. Just take about 20 mil of this

114
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,720
GE and apply it to the orchid cutting.

115
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:16,080
Dilute the GE with one liter of water to

116
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,080
create an effective orchid propagation

117
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,639
solution. Next, I add vitamin B1 to the

118
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,479
mixture to help stimulate root growth

119
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,479
and enhance the plant's health.

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,240
Add three vitamin B1 tablets to the

121
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,360
mixture to enrich it with nutrients,

122
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,360
helping the orchid grow stronger.

125
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,960
[Music]

126
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,199
Step one, use a soft cloth to soak up

127
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,199
the mixture. Then firmly attach it to

128
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,720
the node with the peeled dormant bud to

129
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,720
help the nutrients absorb

130
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:42,880
effectively. This helps stimulate the

131
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:47,399
dormant bud to sprout quickly and

132
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,399
develop into a baby orchid plant.

133
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,560
Step two, use a soft cloth to soak up

134
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,880
the mixture and gently wipe both the top

135
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,440
and bottom of the leaves to allow better

136
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,440
nutrient absorption.

137

[Music]

138
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,920
This mixture helps enhance nutrients and

139
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,920
stimulates strong root

140
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,320
development. Vitamin B1 and the

141
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,600
components in the mixture help the plant

142
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,600
resist diseases and

143
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,040
[Music]

144
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,120
stress. Wiping the leaves helps remove

145
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,560
dirt, creating a shiny surface that

146
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,560
easily absorbs light.

147
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,279
When the leaves are clean and healthy,

148
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,880
the plant will photosynthesize more

149
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,880
efficiently, helping the orchid grow

150
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,640
well. Wiping the leaves with the mixture

151
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,120
helps the plant absorb nutrients through

152
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,880
the leaves more easily, especially when

153
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,760
the plant is young or weak after

154
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,760
blooming.

[Music]

156
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,480
Then transfer the mixture into a spray

157
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,360
bottle for easy application on the

158
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,360
leaves and dormant buds.

159
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,079
Step three, spray this mixture on the

160
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,440
leaves, stem, and roots of the orchid to

161
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,440
provide the plant with complete

162
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,440
nutrients.

163
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,760
Spraying the mixture helps the orchid

164
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,160
recover after pruning or during the

165
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,279
propagation process, promoting quick

166
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,279
recovery and rapid

167
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:19,839
growth. Spraying helps maintain the

168
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,800
ideal humidity for the orchid,

169
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,800
especially in dry environments.

170
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,279
The mixture when sprayed helps stimulate

171
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,480
rapid root growth, especially when the

172
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,480
plant is in the propagation

173
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,880
stage. Step four, spray the mixture onto

174
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,320
this cotton pad to boost nutrients and

175
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,320
support strong growth of the dormant

176
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,320
bud.

177
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,839
Wait about 20 minutes for the nutrients

178
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,320
to absorb into the dormant bud before

179
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,320
removing the

180
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:06,079
cotton. The leftover mixture in the

181
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,320
bottle can be used to spray on other

182
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,760
orchids in the garden. It will be very

183
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,440
beneficial for their

184
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,600
growth. For healthy orchids, apply once

185
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,920
or twice a month. For orchids being

186
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,760
stimulated to sprout keakis, apply three

187
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,760
to four times a month for best

188
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,760
results. Step five, water the orchid pot

189
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,200
with this mixture to stimulate the

190
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,200
growth of keis on the

191
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,600
spike. Um, water each pot with about 10

192
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,000
tablespoons to provide enough nutrients

193
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,000
for the

194
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,120
plant. When watering with this mixture,

195
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,959
it will provide nutrients that help the

196
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,480
dormant buds on the flower spike grow

197
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,480
quickly and sprout into

198
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,920
keakis. Watering with this mixture helps

199
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,399
the orchid become healthier, increasing

200
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,519
its ability to endure and thrive during

201
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,120
the propagation

202
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:04,959
process. Apply this to the orchid three

203
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,720
to four times a month to effectively

204
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:10,040
stimulate the dormant buds to sprout

205
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,040
into keis.

206
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,519
Step six, use a soft cloth to wipe off

207
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,360
any excess mixture on the leaves and

208
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,959
between the leaf crevices to prevent the

209
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,240
plant from staying too moist for too

210
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,240
long, which can lead to mold.

211
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,160
Step six, use a soft cloth to wipe off

212
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,079
any excess mixture on the leaves and

213
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,680
between the leaf crevices to prevent the

214
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,200
plant from staying too moist for too

215
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:50,000
long, which can lead to

216
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:51,760
mold. After about 20 minutes, remove the

217
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,440
cloth from the dormant bud to allow the

218
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,680
nutrients to have fully absorbed into

219
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,680
the plant.

220
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,639
Now let's take a look at the results

221
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,639
after 30 days of

222
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:11,760
care. You can see that the kei has

223
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:15,360
sprouted and is quite healthy. Uh

224
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,360
proving that this method is very

225
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,160
effective. Although small, the kei

226
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:27,000
already has roots showing strong

227
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,000
development right from the early stages.

228
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,199
The mother orchid has also grown many

229
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:43,240
new roots, proving that this care method

230
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,240
helps the plant grow healthy.

231
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,000
You can also see that the orchid's

232
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,680
leaves have become glossy green, showing

233
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,160
good health and growth after applying

234
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,160
this care method.

236
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,680
Uh, I continue to care for the orchid

237
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,839
with the natural fertilizer mix from the

238
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,399
GE product to maintain strong and

239
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,399
sustainable growth.

240
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,640
Now, let's take a look at the results

241
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:16,120
after 45 days of care with the natural

242
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,120
GE fertilizer.

243
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,039
You can see that the kei on the stem has

244
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,559
grown bigger and healthier, proving that

245
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,559
the care method is very

246
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,280
effective. However, the orchid is still

247
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:41,559
small and not yet ready to be separated

248
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,559
and replanted into a new pot.

249
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,760
Uh, I continue to care for the orchid

250
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,559

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,679
You can see that the orchid plant

262
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,760
growing on the stem now has leaves and

263
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,520
roots that are developing very

264
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,799

new flower spike, showing that the care

269
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,050
method has really helped the plant grow

270
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:44,230
