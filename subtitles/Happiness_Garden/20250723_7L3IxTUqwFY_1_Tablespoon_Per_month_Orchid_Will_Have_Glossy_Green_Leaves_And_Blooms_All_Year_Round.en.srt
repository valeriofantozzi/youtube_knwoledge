Today, I continue to share with you how

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,160
to care for your orchids at home using

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,160
homemade fertilizer. Simple but

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,160
effective.

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,320
Um, with this method, your orchid will

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,240
not only stay healthy, but can also

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,680
bloom continuously, bringing lasting

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,020
And after a short time, the leaves will

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,120

Uh to make this natural fertilizer, we

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,520
will need bananas, a familiar ingredient

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,069
that is rich in potassium and essential

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,280

30
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,640
Before using, you should wash the banana

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,080
thoroughly, especially the peel, as it

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,400
may still contain traces of

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,479
preservatives. This cleaning step helps

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,880
ensure your natural fertilizer is safer

35
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,880
for the plant and more environmentally

36
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,880

flower growth, but also naturally and

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:50,799

balance the pH of the solution and

56
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,360
supports mild fermentation, which

57
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,519
enhances the breakdown of nutrients in

58
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,480

70
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,560

193
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,320
surface. This helps you detect signs of

194
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,399
pests, leaf spots, or abnormalities in

195
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,920
time, allowing for early treatment and

196
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,920
more effective protection of your

197
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,920
orchid.

198
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,440
Regularly wiping the leaves with a

199
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,240
natural solution also helps them become

200
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,080
glossier and healthier. This is not only

201
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,240
a sign of a well-rowing plant, but also

202
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,800
adds to the orchid's vibrant, lively,

203
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,800
and radiant appearance.

204
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,120
You only need to wipe the leaves with

205
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,120
this solution about one to two times a

206
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,120
month.

207
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,040
Method two, you can pour the solution

208
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,040
into a spray bottle for more convenient

209
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,040
use.

210
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,880
With this method, simply spray a light

211
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,880
mist onto both the underside and top

212
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,040
side of the leaves. This helps the

213
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:11,959
fertilizer absorb quickly while keeping

214
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,959
the leaf surfaces cool and fresh.

215
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,360
When spraying the solution onto the

216
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,600
leaves, the nutrients from the banana

217
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,360
quickly penetrate through the epidermis,

218
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,360
allowing the plant to absorb them

219
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,040
directly without waiting for root

220
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,880
uptake.

221
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,800
This is an effective way to supplement

222
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,839
micronutrients, especially during

223
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,839
recovery or before blooming.

224
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,120
The fine mist from the spray bottle

225
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,600
helps maintain stable moisture levels on

226
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,079
the leaves, especially on hot days or

227
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,079
when the air humidity is low. This

228
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,839
prevents the leaves from drying out,

229
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,959
reduces stress, and keeps the plant

230
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,959
looking naturally fresh.

231
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,640
Method three, you can use the diluted

232
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,480
solution to water directly at the base

233
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,320
of the plant, allowing the roots to

234
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,720
absorb nutrients naturally and

235
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,040
effectively. This is a way to care from

236
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,040
the inside out, nourishing the entire

237
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,839
plant from roots to tip, helping the

238
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:22,440
roots grow strong. The leaves stay lush

239
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,440
green and the flowers bloom longer.

240
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,639
The banana and vinegar solution has a

241
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,440
mild acidity that creates an unfavorable

242
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,440
environment for fungi and certain pests.

243
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,440
Regular watering with it not only

244
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:40,200
nourishes the plant, but also helps

245
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,200
protect the orchid from harmful agents.

246
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,600
After watering, you can let the orchid

247
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,680
pot soak in the solution for about 20

248
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,839
minutes to allow the roots to fully

249
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,000
absorb the nutrients, soften the growing

250
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:55,000
medium, and support the plant's overall

251
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
recovery.

252
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,320
Um, you can use the remaining solution

253
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,240
to spray on other orchids that are

254
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,639
growing normally in your garden. This is

255
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,560
a great way to gently uh provide

256
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,399
nutrients, helping the plants maintain

257
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,399
vitality and grow steadily.

258
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,320
For orchids that have finished blooming,

259
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,800
this type of fertilizer will help the

260
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,440
plant recover quickly, nourish the roots

261
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,760

262
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:25,480
leaf growth, and prepare energy for the

263
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,480
next blooming cycle.

264
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,880
For blooming orchids, the natural banana

265
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,959
fertilizer provides gentle nutrition,

266
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,959
helping the flowers last longer, the

267
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,279
colors stay vibrant, and the leaves

268
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,279
remain healthy, creating a solid

269
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:43,170
foundation for the plant to maintain its

270
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:44,560
beauty throughout the blooming season.

[Music]

272
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,639
Uh, after soaking for about 20 minutes,

273
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,940
gently take the orchid pot out of the

274
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,839
solution.

275
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:56,880
[Music]

276
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,199
Use a soft cloth to absorb any remaining

277
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,000
water droplets on the leaf surfaces and

278
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,000
between the leaf joints.

279
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,240
This step helps prevent water

280
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,240
accumulation that can cause leaf rot

281
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,240
while keeping the plant dry, clean, and

282
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,240
healthy.

283
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,000
In addition, wiping off the remaining

284
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,240
water helps improve the plant's

285
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,560
photosynthesis process.

286
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,839
When the leaf surface is clean and dry,

287
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,600
light can more easily reach the

288
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,839
epidermis, thereby promoting more

289
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,839
effective light absorption and energy

290
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,839

292
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,519
After finishing the care, place the

293
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,199
orchid pot in a cool, well ventilated

294
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,920
spot with gentle light in the early

295
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,079

the plant photosynthesize well, avoid

297
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:58,000
leaf burn, and recover healthily.

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,760
You can clearly see the wonderful

301
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,760
changes

302
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,360
from the old flower spike. After being

303
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,680
properly cared for over time, new flower

304
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,959
branches have started to grow. This is a

305
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,199
sign that the orchid has not only

306
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,639
recovered well, but is also ready to

307
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,800

From an old flower spike that once

314
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,240
seemed drained of energy, fresh new buds

315
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,080

consistent care, love, and patience

321
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,920

just a flower. It is a life journey with

334
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,079
moments of budding, fading, and rising

335
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,240
