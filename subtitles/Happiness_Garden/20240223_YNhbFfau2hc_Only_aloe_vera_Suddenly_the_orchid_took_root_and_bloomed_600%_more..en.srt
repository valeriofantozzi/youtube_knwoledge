4
00:00:25,338 --> 00:00:33,894
This is a rotten orchid that people threw away, I picked it up to restore it.

5
00:00:38,893 --> 00:00:46,891
The cause of rot is disease-causing fungi and bacteria.

6
00:00:56,241 --> 00:01:08,887
I remove all damaged roots and damaged leaves.

7
00:01:22,884 --> 00:01:32,882
Then rinse with water.

8
00:01:46,085 --> 00:01:55,878
Then hang in a cool place for 2 hours to let the orchid dry naturally.

9
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:06,875
I took 1 aloe vera leaf.

10
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:20,873
Then filter to get aloe vera jelly.

11
00:02:25,601 --> 00:02:33,870
I cut the rest into thin slices.

12
00:02:52,900 --> 00:03:06,897
Then puree with 500ml of water.

13
00:03:20,898 --> 00:03:30,892
Then filter out the residue.

14
00:03:37,143 --> 00:03:47,889
Next I took 3 spoons of rice.

15
00:03:50,122 --> 00:03:56,887
Add 500ml of water.

16
00:03:56,887 --> 00:04:06,885
Then leave for 2 hours for the nutrients to completely dissolve in the water.

17
00:04:12,097 --> 00:04:16,883
2 HOURS LATER.

18
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:31,880
Take aloe vera jelly and wipe the leaves.

19
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:42,878
This helps wilted orchids recover and grow very quickly.

20
00:04:43,878 --> 00:04:52,876
At the same time, it also kills disease-causing bacteria and fungi very effectively.

21
00:05:03,874 --> 00:05:12,872
Mix the two types together.

22
00:05:34,323 --> 00:05:42,899
Soak the roots in this water for 30 minutes.

23
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:51,897
This helps the roots not rot and grow new roots very quickly

24
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:32,889
Then plant the orchid in a new pot for the orchid to recover.

25
00:06:39,388 --> 00:06:48,886
Covering the pot with a layer of moss helps retain moisture better.

26
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:06,883
From now on water this once a week.

27
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:32,877
And spray this water on the leaves once a week.

28
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:54,873
Place in a light and airy place so the orchid can recover easily.

29
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:04,871
1 MONTH LATER.

30
00:08:07,811 --> 00:08:16,869
The leaves become stronger and a new leaf grows.

31
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:30,899
And many new roots grow.

32
00:08:45,896 --> 00:08:55,438
These new roots help absorb nutrients better, so the orchid will recover very quickly

33
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:11,891
Continue watering this once a week.

34
00:09:14,891 --> 00:09:23,889
and Continue spraying this water once a week.

35
00:09:36,886 --> 00:09:39,886
AFTER THE NEXT 2 MONTHS.

36
00:09:40,885 --> 00:09:46,884
This leaf has completely recovered and become lush

37
00:09:52,883 --> 00:10:01,881
The roots grow strongly and produce many new roots.

38
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:12,879
With this simple method, the orchid recovered completely very quickly.

39
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:20,878
