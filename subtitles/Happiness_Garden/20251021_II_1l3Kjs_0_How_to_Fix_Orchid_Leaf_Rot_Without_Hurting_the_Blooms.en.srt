Welcome to the happiness garden. Your

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,000
orchid is blooming, but its leaves are

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,920
rotting. Don't worry. Today, I'm sharing

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,599
a natural way to handle it, helping

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,430
prevent the rot from spreading while

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:19,520
keeping the flowers fresh for longer.

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,720
Let's get started.

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,640
You can see this is an orchid with

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,840
leaves severely rotting due to fungal

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,160
disease. If not treated promptly, the

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,239
rotting leaves can spread to other parts

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,079
of the plant, affecting its overall

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,760
health.

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,440
While the orchid is still blooming

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,239
beautifully, the question is how to

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,040
completely handle the leaf rot without

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,200
affecting the flowers on the stem. Don't

20
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,480
worry, watch this entire tutorial and

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,280
you'll be able to deal with this

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,079
situation easily and safely for both the

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,079
leaves and the flowers.

33
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,960
Now, we need to remove the rotting

34
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,960
leaves and roots.

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,240
But before cutting, it's important to

37
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,439
disinfect the pruning tools with rubbing

38
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,960
alcohol to ensure that fungi or bacteria

39
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,119
do not spread to the healthy parts of

40
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,119
the plant.

41
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,680
These rotting leaves contain a lot of

42
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,640
bacteria, so removing them as quickly as

43
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,880
possible is very important. If left for

44
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,200
too long, the bacteria can spread to

45
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,160
healthy leaves and roots, affecting the

46
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,920
overall vitality of the plant.

47
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,400
By removing them in time, you can

48
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,640
prevent the spread, protect the orchid's

49
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,520
continued growth, and keep the flowers

50
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:25,159
on the stem looking fresh and beautiful.

52
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,640
It's best to destroy these rotting

53
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,560
leaves using a disinfectant or dispose

54
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,599
of them outside in the garden, avoiding

55
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,599
leaving them near healthy plants.

56
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,440
Make sure to remove all the rotting

57
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,040
parts and cut slightly beyond the rotten

58
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,280
area to ensure no bacteria or or damaged

59
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,200
tissue remains. Cutting a little extra

60
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,040
will help the orchid recover better and

61
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,440
prevent the rot from spreading to other

62
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,440
healthy parts.

Next, check the roots by gently

66
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,800
squeezing each one. If any root is soft,

67
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,480
mushy, or hollow inside, it's a sign

68
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,040
that the root has rotted and should be

69
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,040
cut off immediately.

70
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,760
Timely identification of these damaged

71
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,159
roots is very important as it helps you

72
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,000
remove the diseased parts, prevent the

73
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,640
spread and protect the remaining healthy

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,640
root system. When the healthy roots are

75
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,480
preserved, the orchid will continue to

76
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,239
absorb nutrients effectively and

77
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,440
maintain steady growth, keeping the

78
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,440
flowers fresh and beautiful.

Uh-huh.

83
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,120
Since the orchid has flowers on the

84
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,160
stem, I won't be changing the growing

85
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,639
medium at this time. Instead, we'll wait

86
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,720
until the flowers fade and then change

87
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:47,639
the medium to avoid affecting the

88
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,639
blooming process and the plant's health.

89
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,759
Next, sprinkle cinnamon powder on the

90
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,080
cut. This helps the cut heal quickly

91
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,639
because cinnamon has antibacterial and

92
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,639
antifungal properties, preventing

93
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,639
bacteria or fungi from entering the new

ventilated area for 3 days and do not

98
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,759
water it. This allows the cut to dry

99
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,240
completely in the medium to reduce

100
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,560
moisture, creating an ideal environment

101
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,560

102
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,560

After 3 days without watering, when the

105
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,199
cuts have completely dried, the orchid

106
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,880
will be in a safer condition.

107
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,560
At this point, you can confidently

108
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,400
continue with the next care steps

111
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,919
to rest during this stage not only helps

112
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,919
the wounds heal, but also gives the

113
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:30,360
orchid time to regain strength and

114
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,360

116
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,919
The first ingredient I choose to make

117
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,720
natural fertilizer for orchids is aloe

118
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,800
vera leaves. You only need one fresh

119
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,720
aloe vera leaf as it contains many

120
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,720
beneficial nutrients for the plant,

121
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,479
especially helping to restore roots and

122
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,479
make the leaves naturally shiny and

123
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,479
green.

124
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,560
The next ingredient is honey, and you

125
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,080
only need one small teaspoon. Honey not

126
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,160
only has natural antibacterial

127
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,400
properties, but also helps stimulate the

128
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,680
growth of new roots and enhances the

129
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,759
orchid's ability to absorb nutrients.

[Music]

131
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,560
The next ingredient is vitamin B1. You

132
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,280
only need three tablets of 2.5 millig

133
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,280
each. Vitamin B1 helps stimulate root

134
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,960
growth, strengthen resistance, and

135
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,680
support the orchid's recovery after

136
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,440
pruning or environmental changes. When

137
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,360
dissolved together with aloe vera and

138
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,039
honey, this mixture provides the

139
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,680
essential energy and nutrients that help

140
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,000
the orchid grow strong from roots to

141
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,400
leaves and produce longerlasting, more

142
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,400
beautiful blooms.

143
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,460
After preparing all the ingredients, add

144
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:03,550
them all into one liter of clean water.

Next, blend the mixture thoroughly.

147
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,520
Blending helps release the nutrients in

148
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,759
aloe vera, honey, and vitamin B1 to the

149
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,919
fullest, allowing them to dissolve

150
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,280
easily into the water. As a result, when

151
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,680
used, the orchid can absorb the

152
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,179
nutrients more quickly and benefit from

153
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,349
natural, long-lasting care.

the residue to get a clearer and

157
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,080
smoother solution. This step helps the

158
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,240
liquid absorb more easily into the roots

159
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,000

160
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,880
while also preventing blockage on the

161

and the surface of the orchid's growing

169
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,160
medium. Misting in this way allows the

170
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,399
nutrients to penetrate deeply into the

171
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,440
roots, providing the necessary moisture

172
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,600
and energy for faster absorption.

173
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,600
This is a simple yet effective way to

174
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,519
nourish the plant from the base, helping

175
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:54,120

When you you spray the solution only on

the roots and the growing medium without

180
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,440
spraying it on the stems and leaves, the

181
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,320
plant won't have water accumulating on

182
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,560
the leaf surface. This is very important

183
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,519
because uh standing water is the main

184
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,079
cause of leaf rot in orchids.

185
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,320
This way you provide enough nutrients to

When you wipe the leaves with a mixture

194
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,920
of aloe vera, honey, and vitamin B1, the

195
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,600
natural nutrients will be absorbed

196
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,680
directly through the leaf surface,

197
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,680
making the leaves greener, shinier, and

198
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,160
full of vitality.

199
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,160
Aloe vera provides natural moisture to

200
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,560
prevent the leaves from drying out,

201
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,680
while honey forms a a thin protective

202
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,650
layer that helps the leaves retain water

203
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:20,080

Regularly wiping the leaves helps remove

206
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,519
dust, bacteria, and mold from the

207
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,600
surface, allowing light to reach them

208
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,920
more easily. When the leaves are clean

209
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,160
and bright, photosynthesis becomes more

210
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:40,760
efficient, helping the plant absorb

211
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,760
energy better and grow more vigorously.

Honey has natural antibacterial

properties while aloe vera contains

215
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,200
antifungal compounds that help limit the

growth of bacteria and fungal diseases

217
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,800
on the leaves. Wiping the leaves with

218
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,200
this mixture creates a natural

219
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,680

223
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,680
Vitamin B1 in the mixture plays a role

229
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:31,440
stronger root growth and results in more

230
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,440
abundant, longerlasting blooms.

231
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,079
You should spray and wipe the leaves

232
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,079
with this mixture once a week. This

233
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,160
frequency allows the orchid to absorb

234
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:49,160
nutrients regularly while keeping the

The orchid now looks healthy, vibrant,

272

In addition, you can see that many new

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,160
roots have started to grow. The light

279
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,160
green or bright white root tips indicate

280
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,279
that the plant is absorbing nutrients

281
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,279
well and recovering strongly.

282
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,920
When the roots grow strong like this,

283
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,079
the plant becomes more stable, absorbs

284
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,079
water and nutrients more efficiently,

285
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:51,720
and its leaves become greener while the

286
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,720
