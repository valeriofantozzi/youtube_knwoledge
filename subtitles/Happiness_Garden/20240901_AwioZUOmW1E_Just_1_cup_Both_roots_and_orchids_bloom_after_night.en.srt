00:00:18,406 --> 00:00:21,074
Welcome to my channel

2
00:00:21,074 --> 00:00:27,201
When growing orchids, everyone wants the orchid to grow healthy and flower a lot,

3
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:31,057
And if that's what you want, watch to the end of the video.

4
00:00:31,057 --> 00:00:37,266
Today I will show you how to make a new organic fertilizer, it is made from bell peppers,

5
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:45,134
It's great because it helps the orchid grow and bloom a lot of flowers for you

6
00:00:46,656 --> 00:00:49,393
You see this orchid of mine,

7
00:00:49,393 --> 00:00:52,969
Thanks to the fertilizer I made myself from bell peppers

8
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:56,362
so its leaves are always green and sturdy,

9
00:00:56,362 --> 00:01:05,594
The roots are very large, growing healthy,

10
00:01:08,932 --> 00:01:24,626
grow many buds and do not fall,

11
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:37,398
Flowers bloom brilliantly and long.

12
00:01:37,886 --> 00:01:40,435
 Let's start doing it

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,394
Use 20 grams of bell pepper

14
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:59,366
Add 600ml of water

15
00:02:15,367 --> 00:02:20,639
filter out residue

16
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:28,494
Add water to make 1 liter

17
00:02:28,494 --> 00:02:33,661
Bell peppers contain many vitamins A, C, amino acids and minerals: Calcium, magnesium, zinc.

18
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:40,005
In particular, bell peppers are very high in sugar and phosphorus and potassium

19
00:02:40,987 --> 00:02:45,865
Those are the organic substances necessary for the growth of orchids

20
00:02:48,204 --> 00:02:52,397
Water this once a month

21
00:02:52,397 --> 00:02:56,535
The nutrients in bell peppers will stimulate orchid growth,

22
00:02:56,535 --> 00:03:01,332
The phosphorus content in bell peppers will stimulate the roots to grow very quickly,

23
00:03:01,332 --> 00:03:09,108
The potassium and sugar content will help the orchid transport water and sugar from the roots to the leaves, to the flower branches,

24
00:03:09,108 --> 00:03:16,615
When there is potassium and sugar, the leaves will never wilt,

25
00:03:16,615 --> 00:03:25,997
Flower buds will also not fall when given enough sugar and potassium in bell peppers

26
00:03:32,268 --> 00:03:34,628
This is milk

27
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:37,330
milk without sugar

28
00:03:40,014 --> 00:03:55,814
Mix 30ml milk with 70ml water

29
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:13,817
Clean the surface of orchid leaves with milk

30
00:04:14,615 --> 00:04:19,356
The stomata on the leaves will be ventilated

31
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:26,315
Insects on leaves are also removed

32
00:04:26,928 --> 00:04:33,245
Disease fungi and bacteria on leaves are also eliminated

33
00:04:36,283 --> 00:04:42,663
At the same time, milk is also a very good source of nutrients for plants

34
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,582
Orchids are also provided with nutrients through their leaves

35
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:58,706
so the orchid will always be green and sturdy

36
00:05:01,493 --> 00:05:09,749
Note: it is necessary to thoroughly wipe both the top and bottom of the leaves

37
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:19,050
The underside of the leaf is a humid place, so fungi and bacteria hide and work

38
00:05:20,522 --> 00:05:29,061
Orchids are very susceptible to leaf rot caused by fungi and bacteria

39
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:39,377
The underside of the leaves is also a shelter for insects,

40
00:05:39,377 --> 00:05:47,167
They will destroy the orchid leaves starting here,

41
00:05:49,086 --> 00:05:54,683
They will destroy the orchid leaves starting here,

42
00:05:54,683 --> 00:06:01,301
It will then spread causing the entire leaf to turn yellow

43
00:06:03,595 --> 00:06:05,595
you see

44
00:06:06,071 --> 00:06:10,736
After wiping the green orchid leaves

45
00:06:10,736 --> 00:06:16,414
Orchids will photosynthesize well

46
00:06:16,894 --> 00:06:23,732
Orchid's metabolism will also be better

47
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:35,047
Lan will increase resistance

48
00:06:35,047 --> 00:06:41,862
when the orchid is healthy

49
00:06:41,862 --> 00:06:51,015
and enough nutrition

50
00:06:51,015 --> 00:06:55,332
with good care

51
00:06:55,332 --> 00:07:01,912
When blooming, it will be very fresh and long-lasting.

52
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:43,157
 Healthy roots contribute to good nutrient absorption for orchids

53
00:07:43,157 --> 00:07:58,872
Hope the video content will help you in taking better care of orchids at home

54
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:26,900
Welcome to my channel

55
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:33,899
Today I continue to share a new organic fertilizer to help stimulate flowering for orchids.

56
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:39,898
It is made from part of the red beetroot.

57
00:08:39,898 --> 00:08:45,897
It is really a great fertilizer for flower growth

58
00:08:45,897 --> 00:08:53,895
Using this fertilizer will always have beautiful orchids,

59
00:08:54,895 --> 00:09:02,893
Your garden always blooms,

60
00:09:02,893 --> 00:09:12,891
Each orchid will bloom again and again many times a year

61
00:09:15,891 --> 00:09:17,890
STEP 1

62
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,889
This is red beetroot

63
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:28,888
Eat beets, do not rush to throw away the skin

64
00:09:28,888 --> 00:09:33,887
Beetroot contains many minerals

65
00:09:33,887 --> 00:09:39,886
vitamins like B1, B6, B12

66
00:09:39,886 --> 00:09:46,884
They are essential nutrients important for orchid growth

67
00:09:49,884 --> 00:09:52,883
Use the peel of 1 red beetroot

68
00:09:52,883 --> 00:10:02,881
This young shoot will contain many plant stimulants called AUXIN

69
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:08,880
will stimulate the budding of plants and flower buds.

70
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,879
Add 1 liter of water

71
00:10:45,873 --> 00:10:54,871
Closed

72
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:09,868
Leave in a cool and dark place for 6 hours

73
00:11:14,867 --> 00:11:21,899
AFTER 6 HOURS

74
00:11:37,896 --> 00:11:49,893
Add water to get 4 liters

75
00:11:56,892 --> 00:12:01,891
Now water the orchid with this water

76
00:12:01,891 --> 00:12:07,890
Red radish is rich in natural potassium,

77
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:16,888
so orchids are easier to absorb than chemical potassium and safe

78
00:12:16,888 --> 00:12:23,887
Potassium helps balance water and ions,

79
00:12:24,887 --> 00:12:33,885
Potassium also controls stomatal activity,

80
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:43,883
prevent excessive water loss in dry conditions,

81
00:12:43,883 --> 00:13:00,879
Therefore, potassium is one of the essential macronutrients provided to plants during the maturation and flowering stages,

82
00:13:05,878 --> 00:13:09,878
Same goes for orchids,

83
00:13:09,878 --> 00:13:20,875
So, if you want orchids to have flowers, pay attention to fertilizing with high potassium content,

84
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:29,874
Do this once a month for your orchid to bloom

85
00:13:29,874 --> 00:13:45,871
Note that you should not apply too much potassium because if you apply too much potassium, the orchid will have atrophy of its roots, small and bad leaves.

86
00:13:45,871 --> 00:13:56,868
Applying this fertilizer once a month is enough.

87
00:13:56,868 --> 00:13:59,868
STEP 2

88
00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:13,632
Use 1/3 teaspoon of baking soda

89
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,629
add 1 liter of water

90
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:31,628
use cotton balls

91
00:14:33,628 --> 00:14:57,623
Wipe the top and bottom of the orchid leaves with baking soda salt water,

92
00:14:57,623 --> 00:15:09,621
Baking soda is a very good disinfectant,

93
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:16,619
Please clean the orchid leaves once a month,

94
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:26,617
it helps to remove dirt on the leaves,

95
00:15:26,617 --> 00:15:34,616
and kill fungi and bacteria on orchids,

96
00:15:34,616 --> 00:15:42,614
and also kill insects such as aphids, aphids, mosquitoes... clinging to orchids,

97
00:15:42,614 --> 00:15:49,613
Helps protect orchid leaves always beautiful shine,

98
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:58,611
Orchid leaves photosynthesize better,

99
00:15:58,611 --> 00:16:06,609
When the orchid is healthy, it will always bloom with many beautiful and long-lasting flowers

100
00:16:06,609 --> 00:16:11,875
Thank you for watching the video. good luck and happy
