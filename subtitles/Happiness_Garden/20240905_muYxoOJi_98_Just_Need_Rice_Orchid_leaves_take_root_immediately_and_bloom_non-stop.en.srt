00:00:15,268 --> 00:00:18,897
Hello friends, today I share one way

2
00:00:18,897 --> 00:00:25,895
Restore orchids, when the leaves have turned yellow and dried like this

3
00:00:27,206 --> 00:00:33,894
with these orchids, when the leaves above are still green

4
00:00:33,894 --> 00:00:39,893
and be healthy, don't give up

5
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:47,891
and these roots were damaged

6
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:53,890
So the plant cannot metabolize

7
00:00:57,889 --> 00:01:02,888
Let's cut in here

8
00:01:07,187 --> 00:01:13,886
Remove these yellow and rotten leaves from the plant

9
00:01:55,878 --> 00:02:02,876
Cut more to remove crushed stems and prevent the orchid from rotting further

10
00:02:16,412 --> 00:02:23,872
and this part of the roots is completely damaged
so it cannot be restored

11
00:02:26,238 --> 00:02:32,870
Rinse thoroughly with water

12
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:39,869
This helps the tree recover faster

13
00:02:41,002 --> 00:02:47,867
helps orchids, even though they only have one leaf, can revive faster and easier

14
00:02:49,191 --> 00:02:55,899
Wipe this leaf again until it is completely dry

15
00:02:58,162 --> 00:03:04,897
And this method will remove dirt and insects still attached to this leaf

16
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:13,895
Just use 3 tablespoons of rice

17
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:17,895
Contains many B vitamins

18
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:25,893
Add 500ml of water and wait 30 minutes before using

19
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:35,891
After 30 minutes Take this rice water

20
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:45,889
Rice will be very good and help orchids grow very quickly

21
00:03:56,296 --> 00:04:00,886
Use soft cotton pads

22
00:04:00,886 --> 00:04:06,885
Wipe the leaves again and add nutrients through the leaves

23
00:04:06,885 --> 00:04:11,884
Helps orchid leaves recover

24
00:04:12,202 --> 00:04:18,883
Will not be infected by insects and fungus

25
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,879
put the leaf here and let's add this rice water

26
00:04:44,877 --> 00:04:52,876
Leave it for 30 minutes to help the plant regenerate its roots very quickly

27
00:04:56,875 --> 00:05:01,874
and use the remaining rice water

28
00:05:11,872 --> 00:05:16,871
Spray directly on orchids, it will help orchids

29
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:22,870
grows very quickly and remember to spray under the leaves

30
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:29,868
to prevent the growth of insects

31
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:36,867
You should apply this method every 2 weeks

32
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:45,899
Rice water helps beneficial microorganisms grow, stimulates root growth and protects roots

33
00:05:49,898 --> 00:05:56,896
Orchids will always be green and bloom many flowers

34
00:06:00,391 --> 00:06:06,894
Orchids will always be green and very healthy

35
00:06:06,894 --> 00:06:13,893
Orchids blooming on branches can last 6 months before fading

36
00:06:17,892 --> 00:06:22,891
After 30 minutes, take the leaves out and wipe off all the water

37
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:35,889
Use 1 clove of garlic, garlic has very good antibacterial and antiseptic properties

38
00:07:02,883 --> 00:07:05,883
Apply to this root

39
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:13,881
Helps this root part become antibacterial

40
00:07:22,261 --> 00:07:28,878
Place the leaf like this and leave it in a cool, dry place for 1 day

41
00:07:35,877 --> 00:07:42,875
After 1 day, the cut will dry and the orchid will recover quickly

42
00:07:48,874 --> 00:07:55,873
Take advantage of plastic boxes and create ventilation holes like this to grow orchids

43
00:08:24,867 --> 00:08:30,899
Take sterilized dry moss and soak it in water

44
00:08:40,336 --> 00:08:45,896
Then use this moss to grow orchids 

45
00:08:45,896 --> 00:08:52,895
Helps create appropriate humidity for flax plants to quickly root

46
00:08:58,244 --> 00:09:02,893
will put it here

47
00:09:10,242 --> 00:09:15,890
Then spray moisturizer with water every 3 days

48
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:37,886
Take advantage of plastic boxes and create ventilation holes

49
00:10:00,881 --> 00:10:07,880
Then cover and place the orchid pot in a cool and well-lit place

50
00:10:18,753 --> 00:10:22,877
1 Month later

51
00:10:24,262 --> 00:10:30,876
The orchids began to grow

52
00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:35,875
The roots were very healthy

53
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:41,873
With this method it is very easy to restore orchids

54
00:10:41,873 --> 00:10:45,873
Root development is faster

55
00:10:45,873 --> 00:10:50,872
to this stage when the tree is already there

56
00:10:50,872 --> 00:10:56,870
If you have strong roots, you will feel secure when replanting

57
00:10:58,432 --> 00:11:05,869
helps this orchid plant grow faster in the outside environment

58
00:11:10,868 --> 00:11:15,900
Use aquaponic plastic beads or pine bark placed underneath

59
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,899
Helps roots grow strongly and not rot 

60
00:11:24,144 --> 00:11:30,897
Spread a layer of moss on top to help retain moisture better

61
00:11:32,335 --> 00:11:39,895
Then plant the orchid and care for it until the roots attach to the substrate before fertilizing

62
00:11:42,895 --> 00:11:48,893
