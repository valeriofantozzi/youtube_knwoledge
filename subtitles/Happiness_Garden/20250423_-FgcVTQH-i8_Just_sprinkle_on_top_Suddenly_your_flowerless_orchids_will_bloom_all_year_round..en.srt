9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,320

[Music]

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,640

16
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:54,480
powder. Uh, it always has antibacterial

17
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,440

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,440
from rotting and

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,840

29
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,799
Contains a lot of minerals. Helps

30
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,910

39
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,879
Before fertilizing, water each orchid

40
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,440
pot. This method helps keep the

41
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,760
substrate and plant roots moist and also

42
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:14,599
a way to remove old fertilizer. Helps

43
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,599
new fertilizers be more easily absorbed.

Step

61
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,120
Use it to immediately care for these

62
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,520
leaves. Applying this method once a week

63
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,800
will add a lot of nutrients through the

64
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,800
leaves. Helps the leaves stay

65
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:39,039
greener.

66
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:55,520
Remember to wipe both sides of the leaf

67
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,080
evenly because insects often cling to

68
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:03,080
the surface of leaves. Helps remove dirt

69
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,080
and insects on orchids very effectively.

70
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,039
When you do this for orchids, it will

71
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,240
always work. Um, regain the green color

72
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,360
of leaves and promote plant

73
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,880
photosynthesis happens faster. Leaves

74
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,880
are always green and healthy.

75
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,080
If the leaves are yellow or infested

76
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,720
with insects, this is it. One of the

77
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,720
very effective ways

98
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,290

99
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:17,559

The ability to absorb is slow, but once

121
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,519
Orchids are tropical plants, so don't

122
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,680
let the growing medium get too dry. It

123
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,900

orchids in places with light during the
