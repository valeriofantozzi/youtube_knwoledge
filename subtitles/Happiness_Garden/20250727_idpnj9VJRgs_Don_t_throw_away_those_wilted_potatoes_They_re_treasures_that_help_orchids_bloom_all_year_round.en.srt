Welcome to my channel.

202
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:56,520
I am an orchid care specialist.

203
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,520
Do you have vitamin B1?

204
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,320
Subscribe to the channel and watch till

[Music]

207
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:23,630
Five tablets of vitamin B1.

208
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:23,630
[Music]

209
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,480
Mix in four cups of room temperature

210
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,480
water, about one liter.

211
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:44,009
[Music]

212
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:50,200
keep in a cool place away from direct

213
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,200
sunlight for 1 hour.

00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,900
[Music]

215
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,480
Then I took five eggshells

216
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,170
[Music]

217
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,919
Eggshells contain many nutrients needed

218
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,520
by plants, including calcium, potassium,

219
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:15,700
and trace elements such as iron,

220
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:22,739
magnesium, manganese, copper, and zinc.

00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:22,739
[Music]

222
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,130
Therefore, eggshells will help provide

223
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:33,380
necessary nutrients for orchids.

224
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:33,380
[Music]

225
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,280
Dry on low heat for 5 minutes.

226
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:47,640
This helps to eliminate fungal diseases

227
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,640
before using as fertilizer.

228
00:19:48,480 --> 00:20:02,080
[Music]

229
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,160
When using eggshells as fertilizer, it

230
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,190
also helps to increase the pH of the

231
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:20,000
soil, helping orchids grow better.

232
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:23,120
[Music]

233
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,280
In addition, I also use 100 g of organic

234
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,840
fertilizer from livestock waste pressed

235
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,840
into dry pellets.

236
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:43,960
[Music]

237
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,960
Then mix the two types together.

238
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:57,440
[Music]

239
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,490
With the orchids that have bloomed all

240
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:03,039
the last flowers,

241
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:03,039
[Music]

242
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:16,799
I apply about 1 oz, about 30 g per Hot

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:18,559
[Music]

244
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,400
orchid after full bloom is very

245
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,960
exhausted. So I need to apply this

246
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:31,760
fertilizer to quickly recover.

247
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:33,679
[Music]

248
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,700
Pay attention to fertilizing far from

249
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:39,519
the root.

250
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,519
[Music]

251
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,039
with orchids in full bloom.

252
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,679
This fertilizer also helps flowers bloom

253
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,679
for a long time.

254
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,679
If you apply this fertilizer every 2

255
00:21:53,280 --> 00:22:00,280
months, it is guaranteed that the orchid

256
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,280
will bloom for 6 months without wilting.

257
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:09,679
[Music]

258
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,600
With orchids with buds, I also apply

259
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,600
this fertilizer to help flower buds grow

260
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,600
faster.

262
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,120

Helps eliminate fungal diseases and

270
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,360
prevent parasitic insects on leaves.

271
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:28,440
At the same time, it supports the supply

272
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,440
of nutrients through orchid leaves.

273
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:35,240
Orchids are always green and growing.

275
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:46,360
Sprinkle the remaining water into the

278
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,640
Vitamin B1 helps strengthen the root

279
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,240
system and promote plant health while

280
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,240
improving the soil's ability to absorb

281
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,240
nutrients.

282
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,760
Vitamin B1 has the effect of protecting

283
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,240
plants from external agents such as

284
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:16,200
drought, sunburn, and cold, and enhances

285
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,200
resistance to plant diseases.

[Music]

287
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:29,400
You should fertilize B1 for orchids once

288
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,400
a month in the cool afternoon.

289
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,240
Results after 1 week.

290
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,400
You can see that after 15 days, the

291
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,760
flowers are still very fresh and more

292
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,760
fragrant than usual.

293
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:51,799
and flowers can bloom again and again

294
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,799
all year round in the garden.

And you can see that after just a week

301
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:12,760
of using, the orchid has grown a lot of

302
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,760

[Music]

304
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,280
So we can use these organic fertilizers

305
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:41,600
to take care of orchids very well.

307
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,640
However, keep in mind that an overdose

308
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,799
can also harm plants. Therefore, it is

309
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,960
advisable to adhere to the dosage that I

00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,960
