00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,120

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,039

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:29,199
a semihydroponic style right at home.

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,439
This method not only helps orchids grow

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,520
healthily, but also makes it easier for

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,000
you to control moisture and nutrients

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,000

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,840
who who love orchids and want to care

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,120

And now, let's explore this amazing

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,280
orchid growing method

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,280
together. This is an orchid I bought

28
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,470
from a local flower shop. And as you can

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,080
see, it has finished

[Music]

31
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,439
blooming. When orchids finish blooming,

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,040
the plant usually focuses all its

33
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,080
nutrients on maintaining and developing

34
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,439
the flowers. So, after the blooms fade,

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,439
the plant may enter a state of

36
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,439
depletion.

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,759
This is why the leaves at the base often

38
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,520
turn yellow and wilt. Don't worry, this

39
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,840
is a natural part of the plant's growth

40
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:36,080
process. Proper care will help the plant

41
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:39,170
recover and prepare for new blooms.

Um, with the semi-hydroponic method, we

45
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,720
need to remove the entire old growing

46
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:55,159

47
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,159

After removing the old growing medium,

51
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,330
you need to cut off any damaged, rotting

52
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:32,319
or diseased roots.

54

These roots not only reduce the plant's

ability to absorb nutrients but can also

56
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,959
spread diseases to the healthy

57
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,800

58
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,120
ensure you don't damage the remaining

The next step is to cut off the old

To make a recovery nutrient solution for

84
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,720
the orchid, you can mix one liter of

85
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:50,550
water with one teaspoon of honey and

86
00:04:46,720 --> 00:05:02,300

ingredients are completely

in this mixture for about 20 minutes.

97
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,720
Soaking the plant like this allows the

98
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,759
roots to directly absorb the recovery

99
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,520
nutrients and essential vitamins while

100
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,600
also boosting the plant's resistance

101
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,199
after the repotting and root treatment

102
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,600
process. In addition, honey also has

103
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,199
mild disinfectant properties, helping to

104
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,520
prevent bacteria and fungi from

105
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,840
attacking the cuts on the roots and stem

106
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,840
after treatment.

107
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,280
After soaking the orchid in the solution

108
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,840
for about 20 minutes, gently take the

109
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,840

110
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:52,560

111
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,280
excess water on the roots, leaves, and

112
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,960
stem. This drying process helps prevent

113
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,720
prolonged moisture which could create

114
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,720

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,720

127
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,680
The next step is to pour water into the

128
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,519
semihydroponic orchid pot. If you're

129
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,399
using tap water, remember to let it sit

130
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,000
overnight before using it for the

131
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,839
orchid. Uh this helps reduce chlorine

132
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,120
and impurities in the water that could

133
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,120
negatively affect the plant's

134
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,040
growth. Note, in a water-based growing

135
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,160
environment, not all the roots of the

136
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,680
orchid should be submerged in

137
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,839
water. Uh only the tips of the roots

138
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,600
need to be submerged in water. This

139
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,519
allows the orchid to absorb enough water

140
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,760
and nutrients without fully submerging

141
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,480
the roots, keeping them healthy and

142
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,839
preventing root

143
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,839
rot. The roots that are not in contact

144
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,399
with the water will be exposed to air,

145
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,120
ensuring gas exchange and providing the

146
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:25,480
necessary oxygen for the plant to thrive

147
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,480
in the semihydroponic environment.

148
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,440
After planting the orchid in the

149
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,000
semi-hydroponic system, you should wait

150
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,560
about 3 days for the roots to stabilize

151
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,279
and adapt to the new environment before

152
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,279
fertilizing the

153
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,040
orchid. To make fertilizer for the

154
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:49,160
orchid, you can mix 3 tesp of oatmeal

155
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,160
powder with one liter of water.

156
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,399
Oatmeal powder will provide nutrients

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,160
such as potassium, calcium, and trace

158
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,670

179
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,399
This helps remove dust, eliminate mold

180

181
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,320

to directly absorb the natural nutrients

00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:21,519

193
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,519
the semi-hydroponic orchid pot or change

roots in the natural fertilizer solution

198
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:42,200
for 20 minutes, take the orchid out and

199
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,200
plant it in the semihydroponic pot.

201
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,880
After planting, you need to top up the

202
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,000
water in the pot so that the roots have

203
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,279
enough moisture and

204
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,120
nutrients. Check the water level to

205
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,959
ensure that only the tips of the roots

206
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,320
are submerged while the rest of the

207
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,839
roots are exposed to air to prevent root

a spot with gentle sunlight as it will

211
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,460
help the plant uh photosynthesize well

212
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:28,130

And now let's take a look at the results

215
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,360
of my orchids grown using the

216
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,360
semihydroponic method.

217
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,440
Uh you can see that this orchid has

218
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,600
multiple flower stems growing from the

219
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,600
same

220
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,600
plant. Um having multiple flower stems

221
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,760
is a wonderful result of using the

222
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,519
semihydroponic method which helps the

223
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,519
plant grow strong and bloom

224
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,519

The healthy root system with many thick

227
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,760
and strong roots is a great sign that

228
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,440
the orchid is receiving enough nutrients

229
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,440

231
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,760
The large and strong roots help the

232
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,800
plant absorb water and nutrients

233
00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:00,839
effectively, supporting the vigorous

234
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,839
growth of the leaves and flowers.

root system is kept in a moist

239
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:27,650

The leaves have also become shiny and

250
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,600
receiving the right amount of nutrients

251
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:14,839

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,640
successfully apply the semihydroponic

271
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:52,120

Large flowers and thick petals are not
