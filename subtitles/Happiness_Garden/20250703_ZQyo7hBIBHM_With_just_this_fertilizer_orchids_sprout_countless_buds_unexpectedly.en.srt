Welcome to the happiness garden where we

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,320
beauty of nature.

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,800
I am your companion on the journey of

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,120
caring for orchids using natural, safe

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,120
and loving methods.

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,240
Today I will guide you on how to make

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,760
completely free organic fertilizer that

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,439
is incredibly effective for the growth

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,760
of orchids.

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,960
Helps orchids produce many flower buds

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,480
and bloom year round in the garden.

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,560
Uh, this fertilizer will help roots

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,800
develop exceptionally, creating a solid

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,079
foundation for orchids to grow fast,

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,840
healthy, and bloom again soon.

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,000
So, let's start exploring how to make

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,000
this wonderful organic fertilizer right

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
now.

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,120
Let's get started.

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,399
Right here, I'm holding a red beet, the

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,510
main ingredient for the natural

23
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:54,879

When you eat beetroot, don't be quick to

26
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,399
throw away the peel because it contains

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,719
many valuable nutrients such as

28
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,040
potassium, phosphorus, and organic

29
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,400
compounds, all of which are extremely

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,400
beneficial for the development of

31
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,400
orchids.

The next ingredient I need is a few

39
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,680
small cloves of garlic. As garlic has

40
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,280
natural antibacterial properties that

41
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,439
help protect orchids from fungal

42
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,530

52
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,959
