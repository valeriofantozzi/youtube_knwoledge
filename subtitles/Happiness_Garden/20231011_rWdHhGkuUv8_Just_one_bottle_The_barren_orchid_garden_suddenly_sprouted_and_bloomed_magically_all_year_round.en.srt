welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:12,898
Caring for orchids with organic fertilizer is always my choice.

3
00:00:15,897 --> 00:00:25,895
because it is very good and reduces environmental pollution from chemical fertilizers.

4
00:00:25,895 --> 00:00:36,893

5
00:00:40,892 --> 00:00:50,890
In this video, I will show you how to make organic fertilizer from tofu residue.

6
00:00:52,890 --> 00:01:02,888
I mixed 100 grams of tofu residue in 2 liters of warm water.

7
00:01:11,886 --> 00:01:21,884
Next add 3 spoons of sugar.

8
00:01:31,882 --> 00:01:46,879
And you add 3 tablespoons of microorganisms used to compost livestock manure.

9
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:16,873
Now I recycle plastic bottles to make this fertilizer.

10
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:46,867
Use cotton to cover this hole so insects don't get into the bottle.

11
00:02:52,900 --> 00:03:02,898
Then apply the tape and be careful not to completely seal it.

12
00:03:02,898 --> 00:03:15,895
This will prevent the jar from exploding when the solution ferments.

13
00:03:21,894 --> 00:03:29,892
Pour into bottle.

14
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:42,890
Note to leave space like this.

15
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:51,888
Then store in a cool place for 1 month

16
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,886
1 MONTH LATER

17
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:22,882
After incubation for 1 month, take 3 spoons of this liquid fertilizer solution.

18
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:45,877
Then mix with 5 liters of water.

19
00:04:47,401 --> 00:04:51,876
FIRST METHOD.

20
00:04:54,875 --> 00:05:04,873
Wipe the top and bottom of the leaves with this solution.

21
00:05:11,872 --> 00:05:21,870
This method helps kill harmful insects and fungi on leaves very effectively.

22
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:32,868
The leaf surface will always be clean.

23
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:51,897
Regularly performing this method will help keep the leaves clean and the orchid will photosynthesize better.

24
00:05:51,897 --> 00:05:59,790
The leaves will be strong and healthy.

25
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,894
SECOND METHOD

26
00:06:11,894 --> 00:06:21,892
Now take this liquid fertilizer mixture and water it on the orchid roots.

27
00:06:25,891 --> 00:06:36,889
Fertilizer from fermented tofu residue helps supplement nutrients and amino acids that are beneficial for orchid growth.

28
00:06:40,888 --> 00:06:50,886
Especially helps stimulate germination and rooting extremely quickly.

29
00:06:54,024 --> 00:07:04,883
The beneficial microorganisms in this fertilizer will effectively protect orchid roots from rotting.

30
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:20,880
THIRD METHOD.

31
00:07:28,898 --> 00:07:38,876
Spray this fertilizer on the entire orchid.

32
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:52,874
This method is similar to using foliar fertilizer.

33
00:07:58,872 --> 00:08:08,870
The nutrients and amino acids in this fertilizer stimulate orchids to develop comprehensively from roots, 

34
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:16,869
stems, leaves and flowers very effectively.

35
00:08:19,868 --> 00:08:29,900
Do all 3 of these methods once a month to supplement nutrition and increase the orchid's resistance.

36
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:34,899
RESULT.

37
00:08:37,898 --> 00:08:47,896
After a month of fertilizing, the orchid has developed many branch roots.

38
00:09:31,911 --> 00:09:41,885
Many buds develop.

39
00:09:48,884 --> 00:09:58,882
The flower color is more vibrant than usual.

40
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:24,877
