Welcome to the happiness garden. If you

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,359
want your orchid pots to always stay

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,679
green and bloom all year round, the

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,480
secret lies in how you nurture them each

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,960
week. Today, I will share with you a

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,680
very simple but surprisingly effective

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,760
natural fertilizer formula. It helps the

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,160
plant stay healthy from the roots with

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,560
lush green leaves and long-lasting

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,720
flowers.

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,960
The first ingredient and also the main

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,320
component in today's natural fertilizer

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,239
formula is bread. You may be surprised,

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,640
but bread contains many wonderful

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,480
nutrients for orchids, especially starch

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,399
and a small amount of natural yeast that

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,160
helps stimulate the growth of beneficial

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,160
microorganisms in the growing

19
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,160
environment.

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,079
You just need to take a piece of bread

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,480
and tear it into small pieces just like

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,559
I'm doing.

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,040
After tearing the bread into small

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,799
pieces, put them all into a clean jar.

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,520
It's important that the jar is

35
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,600
completely clean so the mixture won't

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,840
get contaminated during the fermentation

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,479
process.

38
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,159
Next, add about 600 ml of warm water

39
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,720
into the jar to start preparing the

40
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,720
fermentation process.

41
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,200
The next ingredient is dry yeast, the

42
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,560
kind we usually use for making bread.

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,640
Dry yeast helps speed up the

44
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,320
fermentation process and creates many

45
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,870
beneficial microorganisms for the

46
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,560
orchid.

[Music]

48
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,880
You only need one teaspoon of dry yeast.

49
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,280
This small amount will naturally

50
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,119
activate the fermentation process. Not

51
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,280
too strong, but enough to create an

52
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,280
ideal environment for microorganisms to

53
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,280
grow.

[Music]

55
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,959
And the final ingredient in today's

56
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,640
formula is molasses. it. It's an

57
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,319
excellent source of energy for the

58
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,800
fermentation process, helping

59
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:22,840
microorganisms work actively and break

60
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,840
down nutrients more quickly.

61
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,400
Thanks to the molasses, the fertilizer

62
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,040
mixture will become more nutrient-rich,

63
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:35,720
helping orchids grow strong roots, lush

64
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,720
green leaves, and long-lasting flowers.

After stirring all the ingredients well,

67
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,480
close the lid tightly and place the jar

68
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,519
in a cool, airy spot for about 1 week to

69
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,519
let the mixture ferment naturally.

70
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,280
Once a month, before applying this

71
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,880
natural fertilizer, water each orchid

72
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,720
pot.

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,159
Uh, moistening the growing medium

75
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,959
beforehand will help the orchid roots

76
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,959
absorb nutrients more effectively and

77
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,599
prevent fertilizer shock when the

78
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,280
solution is added afterward. It's just a

79
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,200
small step, but it makes a big

80
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,480
difference, keeping the plant healthy

81
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,480
and helping it bloom more consistently.

When the flower spike has finished

84
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,519
blooming, I cut off that part so the

85
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,239
plant can focus on nourishing its roots

86
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,840
and leaves. Pruning at the right time

87
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,159
helps prevent the plant from losing

88
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,640
energy and encourages new flower buds to

89
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,640
form more quickly.

When watering, pour as much water as

92
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,160
possible. This method helps wash away

93
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,720
excess fertilizer and residual mineral

94
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,240
salts in the growing medium, creating a

95
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,960
clean and safe environment for the

96
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,960

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,479
Watering before fertilizing not only

100
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,080
cleans the growing medium but also helps

101
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,000
the plant absorb nutrients more

102
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,160
effectively. When the medium is

103
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,639
sufficiently moist, orchid roots can

104
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,360
easily take up the fertilizer, avoiding

105
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,199
overdosing or shock to the roots. This

106
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,520
method allows the natural fertilizer to

107
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,280
work at its maximum, promoting strong

108
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,610
roots, lush green leaves, and

109
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:31,579

After watering, soak the entire orchid

113
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,800

115
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,870
washes away any remaining mineral salts

116
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:58,439

fertilizer.

121
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,479
This prevents the fertilizer from

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,960
becoming too diluted or washing away too

123
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,720
quickly while ensuring the orchid roots

124
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,720
absorb the nutrients as effectively as

possible.

126
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,280
This is the reason why orchids become

127
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,039
stunted and slow growing as their roots

128
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,560
are prone to rotting and fungal

129
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,639

mineral salts or old fertilizer that you

132
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,960
apply directly, the roots will be

133
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,360
damaged. The plant will absorb nutrients

134
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,600
poorly and its flowering ability will

135
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,600
also decrease.

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,040
leaves and longlasting flowers.

194
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,800
Finally, this watering also helps wash

195
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,279
away excess mineral salts, preventing

196
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,600
root rot and disease, creating a strong

197
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,600
foundation for orchids to bloom all year

198
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,600

200
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,120
Method two, you you can pour the diluted

201
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,040
fertilizer mixture into a spray bottle

202
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,680
and spray it directly onto the orchid's

203
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,680
base and roots.

204
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,040
This method is very convenient, allowing

205
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,600
the solution to penetrate the growing

206
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:42,680
medium evenly, and you can easily adjust

207
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,680
the amount of fertilizer for each pot.

208
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,480
This habit will help the plant absorb

209
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,880
nutrients effectively, develop strong

210
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,640
roots and lush green leaves, and prepare

211
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,640
for the upcoming vibrant flower

212
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,640
clusters.

213
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,760
Uh when you spray the fertilizer mixture

214
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,160
onto the base and roots, the plant

215
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:09,079
quickly absorbs the nutrients, promoting

216
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,079
strong and evenly growing roots.

217
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,839
The beneficial microorganisms in the

218
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,000
solution will enhance the vitality of

219
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,399
the growing medium, balance the

220
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,399
ecosystem in the pot, and prevent fungal

221
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,399
diseases.

222
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,839
Spraying fertilizer evenly around the

223
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,000
roots also stimulates the growth of new

224
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,760
roots faster, creating a strong

225
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,270
foundation for the plant to anchor

226
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:51,549
firmly and absorb nutrients efficiently.

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,480
Additionally, spraying directly provides

230
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,800
nutrients to the leaves and base of the

231
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,760
plant, helping the leaves stay lush and

232
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:13,480
healthy while reducing burn spots caused

233
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,480
by nutrient deficiencies.

235
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,720
Spraying once a month will increase the

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,040
plant's resistance to diseases and

237
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,720
environmental stress, helping it grow

238
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:37,720
steadily and produce beautiful,

239
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,720
long-lasting blooms all year round.

About 15 minutes after spraying, if you

242
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,160
notice the leaves are still wet from

243
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,820
water droplets, use a soft cloth to

244
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:56,119
gently dry them.

diseases while keeping the leaves clean

249
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,720

Small actions like these contribute to

253
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,000
helping the orchid grow healthily and

254
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,959
produce beautiful, long-lasting blooms

255
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,959
all year round.

[Music]

257
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,320
After drying the leaves, place the

258
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,959
orchid pot in a spot with gentle

259
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,440
sunlight so the plant can perform

260
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,440
photosynthesis effectively. No matter

261
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,160
how good the fertilizer is, if the plant

262
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,639
lacks light, flowering will be affected.

263
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,519
So remember the saying, enough sunlight,

264
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,360
flowers will bloom because light is a

265
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:08,199
crucial factor for orchids to grow

266
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,199
healthily and produce vibrant blooms.

267
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,600
In summary, to keep your orchids healthy

268
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,600
and blooming all year round, you need to

269
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,600
follow all the steps. Prepare the

270
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,600
natural fertilizer. Water before

271
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,240
fertilizing. Apply the fertilizer

272
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,480
directly or spray the mixture. Dry the

273
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,320
leaves if water remains. And finally,

274
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,320
place the pot in a spot with gentle

275
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:34,480
light for the plant to photosynthesize.

276
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,880
When practiced consistently, the orchid

277
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,199
roots will be strong, the leaves lush

278
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,320
and green, and the buds and flowers will

279
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,920
develop evenly and last long.

280
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,440
Care for your plants with all your love

281
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,440
and patience, and you will see your

282
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,839
orchid pots bloom like gifts from

283
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:53,320
