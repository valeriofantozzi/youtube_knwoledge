00:00:27,475 --> 00:00:29,475
welcome to my channel

2
00:00:29,475 --> 00:00:36,365
Rice is a popular and very effective source of organic fertilizer for crops,

3
00:00:36,365 --> 00:00:45,964
and now I will show you 02 ways to make orchid fertilizer from rice.

4
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:48,471
FIRST WAY

5
00:00:50,168 --> 00:01:02,978
Use 3 spoons to eat rice

6
00:01:02,978 --> 00:01:20,830
puree

7
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:52,772
add 1 liter of boiled water

8
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:15,515
Close the lid and wait for it to cool

9
00:02:43,453 --> 00:02:49,740
filter out residue

10
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:59,201
add 2 liters of water

11
00:03:01,035 --> 00:03:05,417
Now use this water to water the orchid

12
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:15,860
Rice contains many nutrients such as potassium, fosfor, and protein, which are essential nutrients for the growth of orchids.

13
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:29,465
Using rice as fertilizer helps provide these nutrients for your orchid garden, helps plants grow healthy, enhances resistance to pests and diseases.

14
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,382
Rice is a food source for beneficial bacteria and microorganisms in orchid growing media

15
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:46,287
Using rice as fertilizer enhances the activity of this microflora in the orchid growing medium, thereby helping the orchid absorb nutrients better.

16
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:52,487
do this once a month

17
00:03:53,459 --> 00:04:00,000
Will help orchids grow healthy

18
00:04:01,388 --> 00:04:13,963
And of course it also blooms a lot

19
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:20,989
The microflora in the orchid growing medium helps to protect the roots from rot

20
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:26,829
When roots grow, they will absorb nutrients to make flowers more beautiful

21
00:04:26,829 --> 00:04:32,087
so flowers bloom long

22
00:04:37,715 --> 00:04:46,524
regular care in this way,

23
00:04:46,524 --> 00:05:17,476
The leaves are also provided with enough nutrients, so they grow very green

24
00:05:22,547 --> 00:05:24,547
SECOND WAY

25
00:05:25,454 --> 00:05:32,885
When we cook, we usually wash the rice

26
00:05:32,885 --> 00:05:36,479
And every time you cook rice, don't rush to throw away this rice water,

27
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:46,616
Please filter this rice water

28
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,593
wait for it to settle down

29
00:05:57,856 --> 00:06:11,480
After settling, we filter 100ml of clear water above

30
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:16,705
add 200ml plain water

31
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:31,049
Put this rice water in a spray bottle

32
00:06:34,315 --> 00:06:42,127
Use this water to spray evenly on the surface of the orchid leaves

33
00:06:42,984 --> 00:06:57,074
Vitamin B1 in rice water helps stimulate the conversion of nutrients, especially harmful substances such as manganese, iron and copper into a more easily absorbed form.

34
00:06:57,932 --> 00:07:05,272
Vitamin B1 helps strengthen the immune system of orchids

35
00:07:06,702 --> 00:07:14,683
Helps plants resist attack by pests and other environmental agents

36
00:07:15,492 --> 00:07:22,732
For the rice water that settles below

37
00:07:24,525 --> 00:07:26,525
I filter out the scum

38
00:07:27,296 --> 00:07:34,060
then add 2 liters of water

39
00:07:36,217 --> 00:07:43,743
And I use this water to water my orchids

40
00:07:43,743 --> 00:07:50,241
we also do this once a month like the first way i shared at the beginning of the video

41
00:07:52,241 --> 00:08:00,172
In addition, you need to combine the use of other organic fertilizers to help the orchid receive full nutrients.

42
00:08:00,876 --> 00:08:06,871
After using this fertilizer for 1 month, the orchid will produce many new roots

43
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:16,869
This helps orchids absorb the most nutrients through the roots

44
00:08:31,825 --> 00:08:39,898
When absorbing enough nutrients and enough light, orchids will bloom many flowers

45
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:48,330
Flower colors are vibrant and long lasting

46
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:56,795
If you like what type of orchid you like, please comment the name of that orchid species below the video comment

47
00:09:00,027 --> 00:09:19,890
Thank you for watching the video. Wishing you all the best of luck and success.
