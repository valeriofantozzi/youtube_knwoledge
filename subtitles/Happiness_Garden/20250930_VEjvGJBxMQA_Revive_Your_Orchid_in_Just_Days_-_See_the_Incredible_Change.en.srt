00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,680
fertilizer that anyone can create.

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:40,200
To create natural fertilizer for

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,200

[Music]

17
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,680
Bananas are rich in potassium, an

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
essential mineral that improves plant

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,560

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,560

[Music]

22
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,560
When bananas decompose, they provide

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,920
easily absorbable nutrients for plants,

24
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,920

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,799
Bananas provide food for beneficial

28
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,370

magnesium and phosphorus which are

52
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,129

Uh, in this video I will share with you

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,720
year round.

207
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,240
Let's get started

208
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,240
to make this magical fertilizer. First,

209
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:58,800
prepare 3 L of clean water in a clean

210
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:01,519
container, ready for the next steps.

211
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,600
Please comment and let me know which

212
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,480

216
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,480
Next, you can use expired milk or

217
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,560
leftover milk from the fridge. A great

218
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,560
way to avoid waste and help your orchids

219
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,560
grow.

220
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:27,199
Just about 1 tsp of milk, equivalent to

221
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:29,360
around 15 ml, is enough for this recipe.

222
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,959
Next, simply stir the milk into the

223
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,959
water until the mixture is fully

224
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,959
blended.

225
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:41,079
Next, we will add a little lemon juice

226
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,079
to the mixture.

227
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,800
You can choose either a yellow lemon or

228
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,010
a green lime. Both provide excellent

229
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:54,720
results.

juice for the mixture to be perfectly

233
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,880

to soak up the mixture and gently wipe

245
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,039
both the top and underside of the leaves

246

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,600
can absorb the nutrients optimally.

287
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:23,520
This spraying method also helps clean

288
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,520
dust and remove insects on the leaves,

289
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,840
especially on the underside where pests

290
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,840
often hide.

291
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,159
Additionally, spraying the mixture on

292
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,480

293
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,880
