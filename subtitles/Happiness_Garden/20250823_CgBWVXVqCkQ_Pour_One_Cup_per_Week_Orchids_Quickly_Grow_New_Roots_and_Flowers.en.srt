Welcome to my happiness garden.

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,320
Today I'm going to continue sharing with

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,480
you a special way to make natural

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,719
fertilizer that helps care for orchids

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,719
at home.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,600
By following some simple steps, you'll

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,840
see your orchids thrive and bloom all

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,840
year round.

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,359
Let's get started.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,920
To make this fertilizer, I need coffee

11
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,920
or you can also use coffee grounds.

12
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,889
[Music]

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,920
Take one teaspoon of coffee powder into

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,920
the pot and add one liter of hot water.

15
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,369

[Music]

19
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,850
Uh, incubate and wait for the water to

20
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,590
cool.

30
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,929
Step one,

31
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,929
[Music]

32
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,120
use a soft cloth soaked in coffee water

33
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,519
to gently wipe the top and bottom of the

34
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,519
leaves thoroughly.

35
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,640
Wiping the leaves helps remove dust and

36
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,760
impurities, allowing the plant to

37
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,760
photosynthesize more effectively.

38
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,720
Coffee can also help increase humidity

39
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,440
for the leaves which is beneficial for

40
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,440
the development of orchids.

41
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,040
Coffee contains many nutrients such as

42
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,040
nitrogen which helps promote plant

43
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,040
growth.

44
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,600
[Music]

45
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,320
The compounds in coffee can enhance the

46
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,320
plant's ability to resist diseases.

47
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,919
Coffee can provide a pleasant aroma to

48
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,919
the surrounding space.

49
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:52,759
These combined benefits help your

50
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,759
orchids stay healthy and thrive better.

51
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,639
Do this step one to two times a month.

52
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,199
Step two,

53
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,280
put the ground coffee solution into a

54
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,280
spray bottle.

55
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,240
And then you spray your entire orchid.

56
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,919
The coffee solution contains nitrogen

57
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,919
and other minerals promoting plant

58
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,919
growth.

59
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,440
Nitrogen is crucial for protein

60
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,080
synthesis and chlorophyll production

61
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,080
necessary for photosynthesis.

62
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,199
Compounds in coffee can help orchids

63
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,720
resist certain diseases and pests,

64
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,120
potentially reducing the need for

65
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,120
chemical pesticides.

66
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,720
Uh spraying coffee solution increases

67
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,840
humidity for the leaves and the

68
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,840
surrounding environment.

69
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,880
After spraying, wiping off the excess

70
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,880
water on orchid leaves is crucial for

71
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,960
several reasons.

72
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,560
Um, water accumulation on leaves can

73
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,440
create a favorable environment for the

74
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,440
growth of fungi and bacteria.

75
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,880
If water is not dried off, the plant is

76
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,440
more susceptible to diseases like leaf

77
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,440
rot or mold.

78
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,720
When water sits on the leaves, sunlight

79
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,199
may be reflected, reducing the plant's

80
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,199
ability to photosynthesize.

81
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,360
Wiping the leaves dry optimizes the

82
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,360
photosynthesis process.

83
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,280
Step three.

84
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,680
When orchid roots appear silvery white

85
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,000
and the growing medium is dry, this

86
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,399
usually indicates that the plant is

87
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,399
lacking water and needs to be watered

88
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,399

After 10 days, new roots also begin to

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,520
New roots help the plant absorb water

391
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,279
and nutrients from the growing medium,

392
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,279
providing the necessary energy for

393
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,279
growth.

394
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,960
Healthy new roots help the plant grow

395
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:41,000
faster, produce more flowers, and

396
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,000
develop shiny green leaves.

398
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,320
