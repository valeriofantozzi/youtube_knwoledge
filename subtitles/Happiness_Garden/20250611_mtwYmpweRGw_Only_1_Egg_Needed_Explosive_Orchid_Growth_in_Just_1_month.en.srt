Welcome to Happiness Garden, where we

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,080
together explore the gentle beauty of

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,440
nature and the love for orchid petals.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,120
Today I want to share with you how to

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,400
care for orchids using natural

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,480
fertilizer, a simple yet effective

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,439
method that helps orchids bloom multiple

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,960
times a year. As a result, your home

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,080
will always be filled with the colors

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,080
and gentle fragrance of nature.

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,760
Uh, the orchid petals after falling

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,600
leave a quiet emptiness on the branch,

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,320
marking the time when the orchid begins

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,239
to weaken. During the blooming period,

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,840
the plant puts all its strength into

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,079
nurturing each petal, gradually

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,600
depleting the energy stored in its stem,

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,840
roots, and leaves.

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,559
We need to cut off the entire old orchid

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,399
branch. This helps the plant focus its

21
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,640
nutrients on nurturing healthy new

22
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,800
shoots while also stimulating the growth

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,160
of new roots, preparing for a more

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:06,240

[Music]

37
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,240
To make natural fertilizer, the first

38
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,240
ingredient I use is eggshells. Eggshells

39
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,560
are rich in calcium, which helps orchid

40
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,799
roots grow strong and also improves soil

41
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,799
quality, creating favorable conditions

42
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,799
for the plant to absorb nutrients more

43
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,799
effectively.

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,160
Take two cleaned eggshells. Then crush

45
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,320
them by hand and put them into a small

46
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:30,959
jar.

[Music]

48
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,440
The next ingredient I use is rice

49
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,160
because rice contains vitamins,

50
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,920
minerals, and a small amount of starch,

51
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,239
all of which are beneficial for orchid

52
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,239
root development.

53
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,480
Take three tablespoons of rice and add

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,240
them to the prepared eggshells. Then

55
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:55,349
pour in about.5 L of boiling water.

[Music]

57
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,360
Um, the high temperature will help

58
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,000
release nutrients from the rice and

59
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,360
eggshells, creating a nutrient-rich brew

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,760
for the orchid.

61
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,080
Close the jar and let the solution cool

62
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,599
naturally. This process helps the

63
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,760
nutrients fully dissolve, ready to

64
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:31,120
nourish your orchid.

well so that the nutrients blend

68
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,599
completely, ensuring the natural

69
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,700
fertilizer works at its best when used

70
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:50,520
for the orchid.

72
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,519
Then we proceed to filter out the

73
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,159
sediment. This helps make the fertilizer

74
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,840
solution clear and easier to absorb into

75
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:06,289

77
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,040
Next, dilute the solution with water at

78
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,360
a ratio of one part solution to one part

79
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,439
water. This helps make the fertilizer

80
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,820
not too concentrated, safe, and easier

81
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:30,269
for the orchid to absorb.

Step one, use a soft cloth to soak up

the fertilizer mixture. Then, gently

85
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,000
wipe both the top and bottom surfaces of

insects and fungal diseases attached to

Note to wipe thoroughly the underside of

105
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,280
the leaves because this is where many

106
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,759
stamata concentrate, helping the leaves

107
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,759
exchange gases and absorb nutrients most

109
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,800
Um the underside of the leaves does not

110
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,440
directly receive sunlight. So it is

111
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,080
often where insects and fungal diseases

112
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,000
tend to gather. Therefore thoroughly

113
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,260
wiping this part is very important to

When you water this mixture onto the

especially the underside of the leaves,

150
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:22,280

154
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,320
vitamins from the eggshells and rice are

nutrients.

193
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,839
As a result, the orchid can fully

194
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,839
benefit from the natural fertilizer

195
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,839
mixture.

196
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,560
After finishing the care routine,

197
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,399
remember to place the orchid pot in a

198
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,120
spot with gentle sunlight and good

199
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,519
ventilation. Light is an essential

200
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,920
factor for photosynthesis, which allows

201
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,079
the orchid to absorb and fully convert

202
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,920
nutrients from the fertilizer, helping

203
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:43,640
the plant recover quickly and grow

204
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,640
stronger each day.

205
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,240
And here is the result after 6 weeks.

206
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,560
You can see the orchid has recovered

207
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,200
strongly with roots developing well.

208
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,959
that

209
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,880
the orchid continues to develop new

210
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:04,519
flower spikes, promising a brilliant

211
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,519
blooming season ahead.

212
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,959
These new roots will help the orchid

213
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,440
absorb more nutrients, enhancing

214
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,650
stability and vitality throughout its

215
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:38,160
growth process.

[Music]

217
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,480
You can also see orchid leaves become

218
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,350
greener and sturdier, proving the

219
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:49,880
plant's improving health.

[Music]

221
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,839
Uh, this orchid pot is the same. Many

222
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,839
new roots have grown and new flower buds

223
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,200
are developing strongly, signaling a

224
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,700
beautiful blooming season is

225
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:14,160
approaching.

[Music]

227
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,079
Um, the calcium in the eggshells along

228
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,639
with the minerals in the rice water help

229
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,399
stimulate the growth of many new roots,

230
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,340
proving that the natural fertilizer

231
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:33,360
mixture is very effective.

[Music]

233
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,120
Uh, rice water also helps improve the

234
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,600
plant's health by providing natural

235
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,940
vitamins and enzymes, supporting growth

236
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:48,079
and fighting pests.

238
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,760

243
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,880
Uh, how do you find my method of

244
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,720
restoring the orchid after the petals

245
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,440
