00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:14,231
To help you have many options when caring for orchids at home with organic fertilizer.

3
00:00:16,897 --> 00:00:26,895
Helps develop new shoots. Flowers bloom profusely and last long.

4
00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:32,894
In this video, I continue to share new methods.

5
00:00:36,227 --> 00:00:46,891
To make this fertilizer, I reuse rice water when cooking rice.

6
00:00:50,890 --> 00:01:00,888
You can use 200 grams of rice like me or more which is also very good.

7
00:01:16,885 --> 00:01:26,883
After washing the rice, cover tightly and leave in a cool place for 24 hours.

8
00:01:35,882 --> 00:01:45,880
Next I used about 10 grams of fresh ginger.

9
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:58,877
Ginger has the ability to stimulate plant growth, helping orchids grow strongly and produce more leaves and flowers.

10
00:02:20,873 --> 00:02:30,871
After mincing, soak in 1 liter of boiled water.

11
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:39,869
and place in a cool place for 24 hours.

12
00:02:52,246 --> 00:02:56,899
24 HOURS LATER.

13
00:03:02,898 --> 00:03:12,896
Only decant the clear water above.

14
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:23,893
I do not use this cloudy water.

15
00:03:48,893 --> 00:03:52,888
FIRST METHOD.

16
00:03:52,889 --> 00:04:02,886
Clean the leaf surface with this liquid fertilizer.

17
00:04:06,305 --> 00:04:14,883
The leaf surface will always be clean and the stomata will be clear.

18
00:04:15,883 --> 00:04:21,882
Orchids will photosynthesize better.

19
00:04:22,882 --> 00:04:29,880
If applied regularly, you will not encounter this problem.

20
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:41,878
Leaves will always be green.

21
00:04:46,877 --> 00:04:50,876
SECOND METHOD.

22
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:58,875
Spray this fertilizer on the entire orchid.

23
00:05:00,874 --> 00:05:10,872
Minerals contained in ginger and fermented rice water will help stimulate rooting and shoot growth very well.

24
00:05:12,672 --> 00:05:20,870
Do this once a month to supplement nutrition and increase the orchid's resistance.

25
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:25,869
THIRD METHOD.

26
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:34,868
Now take this liquid fertilizer mixture and water it on the orchid roots.

27
00:05:39,388 --> 00:05:48,898
Fertilizer from ginger and naturally fermented rice water helps supplement nutrients

28
00:05:48,898 --> 00:05:58,896
and amino acids that are beneficial for orchid growth.

29
00:06:01,857 --> 00:06:11,894
Especially helps stimulate germination and rooting extremely quickly.

30
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,892
ONE MONTH LATER.

31
00:06:23,237 --> 00:06:31,890
Roots begin to sprout.

32
00:06:52,885 --> 00:06:55,885
AFTER 2 MONTH.

33
00:06:58,884 --> 00:07:08,882
The roots grow very healthily, helping the orchid absorb the most nutrients.

34
00:07:21,435 --> 00:07:25,879
AFTER THE NEXT 2 MONTHS.

35
00:07:30,878 --> 00:07:42,875
Many buds develop.

36
00:07:49,615 --> 00:07:59,872
New sprouts grow very strong and grow quickly.

37
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:16,869
AFTER THE NEXT 3 MONTHS.

38
00:08:19,712 --> 00:08:26,900
bloom many flowers.

39
00:08:30,903 --> 00:08:38,898
The flower color is more vibrant than usual.

40
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:53,895
The flowers stay on the branches for a long time before fading.

41
00:08:56,894 --> 00:09:06,892
