Welcome to the Happiness Garden channel.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,279
Are you worried because your orchid

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:11,200
looks wilted? Its leaves are wrinkled

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:13,040
and lifeless? Don't give up just yet.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,599
In this video, I will show you how to

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,440
revive your orchid right at home with

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,880
just a few simple steps and natural

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,880
ingredients available in your kitchen.

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,760
No need for chemicals, no need for

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,359
expensive products. Just a little

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,039
patience and love for your plant and

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,039
you'll see the magic happen.

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,760
In the summer when the weather becomes

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,040
hot and the humidity in the air rises,

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,120
orchids become very vulnerable.

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,600
This is the time when fungal diseases

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,160
become active and your orchid is at risk

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,719
of root rot or leaf rot if not cared for

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,960
properly.

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,559
Uh if you encounter this situation,

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,920
quickly remove the damaged leaves to

22
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,359
prevent the disease from spreading to

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,280
the rest of the plant.

24
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:07,320
Timely action will give your orchid a

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,320
better chance to recover faster.

26
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,439
Waterlogged roots are also one of the

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,119
main causes of rot in orchids.

28
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,520
When the roots can't drain properly,

29
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,080
they become soft, darkened, and easily

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,600
attacked by bacteria and fungi.

31
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,840
Therefore, we need to check the root

32
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,600
system regularly, especially after heavy

33
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,200
watering or prolonged rainy weather.

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,670
Protecting healthy roots is the best way

35
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:46,649
to keep your orchid thriving.

[Music]

37
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,439
You can see the entire root system has

38
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,000
become hollow inside. This indicates the

39
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,719
roots are dead and can no longer absorb

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,320
water or nutrients.

41
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,759
Therefore, I will cut across the orchid

42
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,520
stem and remove all the damaged roots.

43
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,920
The goal is to keep the upper part of

44
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,720
the stem where one green leaf still

45
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,720
remains at the top.

recover and start a new journey.

63
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:28,360
After that, I gently rinse the remaining

stem and leaf with clean water.

65
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,799
This step helps remove bacteria and

fungal spores still clinging to the

67
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,550

To make fertilizer that helps revive the

orchid, the first ingredient I use is an

72
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,840
onion.

73
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,920
Onions have natural antibacterial

74
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,840
properties which help prevent fungal

75
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,840
diseases and stimulate the growth of new

76
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,840
roots.

84
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,639
I make use of onion peels by placing

85
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,840
them in a jar to create a recovery

86
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,680
fertilizer for the orchid.

87
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,000
Because onion peels contain many

88
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,120
nutrients, especially antioxidants and

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,360
natural sulfur, they help fight bacteria

90
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,360

91
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,960
simple, effective, and very economical

92
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,720
method.

93
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,400
After that, I add the onion peels to

94
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,000
about one liter of boiling water.

95
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,919
The high temperature helps extract the

96
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,840
nutrients from the onion peels, creating

97
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:17,800
a natural solution that helps the orchid

98
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,800
recover quickly and safely.

99
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,280
Then I cover the lid and let the water

100
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,880
cool completely.

101
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,720
This allows the essence from the onion

102
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,400
peels to infuse into the water, creating

103
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,400

Rice is rich in B vitamins and natural

Rice water contains B vitamins and

196
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,360
minerals that help the leaves become

197
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,360
smoother, thicker, and shinier over

199
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,000
When the roots and leaves are healthy,

200
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,320
the orchid will accumulate enough

201
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,839

203
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,839
You can apply this method to your orchid

204
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,839
twice a month,

205
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,040

entire leaf surface, especially on the

211
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,880
underside of the leaves where pests

212
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,880
often reside.

213
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,880
Avoid spraying too much water to prevent

214
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,120
water logging and creating an

215
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,200
environment for fungi to grow. Repeat

216
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,839
spraying regularly every 2 weeks or as

217
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,839
needed by the plant.

218
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,240
When the leaves are evenly misted, they

219
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,800
absorb nutrients faster, helping the

220
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,880

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,160
the leaves clean and healthy.

225
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,839
After spraying, it's best to gently dab

226
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,680
the water droplets on the leaves with a

227
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,080

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,079

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,639
You need to prepare a clean support

Gently tie the orchid stem to the

382
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,340
support stick placed in the pot to keep

383
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:50,559
the plant stable.

After repotting, take care of your

386
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,320
orchid consistently by misting the

387
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,960
medium and leaves to maintain moisture.

388
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,039
Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.

389
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,400
After about 1 to two weeks, once the

390
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,640
plant has adapted, you can start

391
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,880
applying a mild fertilizer to encourage

392
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:10,159
healthy root and leaf growth.
