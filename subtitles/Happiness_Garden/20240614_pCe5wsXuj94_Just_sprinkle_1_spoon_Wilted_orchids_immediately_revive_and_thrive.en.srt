00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,151
Welcome to Happiness Garden channel

2
00:00:03,151 --> 00:00:09,865
In this video, I share how to grow it to grow fast

3
00:00:10,935 --> 00:00:15,931
When I just bought orchids,

4
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:21,130
We remove all this moss,

5
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:28,128
Because these orchid pots are grown in an industrial environment,

6
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:36,127
controlled by temperature, humidity, and light Ideal for orchids.

7
00:00:36,128 --> 00:00:43,718
but when brought back, the environment has been changed, making these roots easy to rot

8
00:00:44,893 --> 00:00:51,309
You should cut off the damaged roots.

9
00:00:52,130 --> 00:01:00,075
Then wash the roots.

10
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:10,303
Use used plastic bottles

11
00:01:11,286 --> 00:01:19,052
I recycle to grow semi-hydroponic orchids

12
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:26,650
This way of growing will not need watering

13
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:34,721
but still help the orchid grow very strong,

14
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:45,725
the flowers are more beautiful and brilliant, invite you to watch.

15
00:02:19,582 --> 00:02:30,308
I need to wash the plastic bottle to make sure it's clean from fungi,

16
00:02:30,308 --> 00:02:39,636
and bacteria that are harmful to the orchid.

17
00:03:16,337 --> 00:03:28,574
Using the drill bit will cut out the positions here

18
00:03:49,634 --> 00:03:56,854
This part will be used as an orchid pot

19
00:03:56,854 --> 00:04:04,123
The rest is for water storage

20
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:16,067
Using a glass jar on the bottom will help the roots not absorb too much water.

21
00:04:31,859 --> 00:04:36,208
Put the orchid in

22
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:46,110
 Put terracotta seeds around the pot

23
00:04:46,898 --> 00:04:55,109
grown in a semi-hydroponic environment, often in contact with water

24
00:04:55,109 --> 00:05:02,983
so we use breathable terracotta beads is the best

25
00:05:03,974 --> 00:05:10,813
If it's breathable, it's very rarely rotten

26
00:05:11,735 --> 00:05:18,769
And after planting, the roots will grow very fast

27
00:05:20,713 --> 00:05:27,412
I finished planting

28
00:05:33,621 --> 00:05:38,642
you water the potted plants,

29
00:05:38,642 --> 00:05:46,560
We only water once, next time you don't need to water anymore

30
00:05:47,532 --> 00:05:55,153
With this simple planting method, you save a lot of time to take care of

31
00:05:56,804 --> 00:06:06,859
With this planting method, you will let the water level cover part of the bottom of the pot

32
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:15,126
The water will absorb itself, helping to maintain the moisture in the growing medium,

33
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:20,525
 we will not need to water anymore.

34
00:06:20,525 --> 00:06:29,700
When the water in the container is empty, remember to add more water to keep the growing medium in a moist state

35
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:39,194
This is an orchid, I planted it according to this method, it is growing very fast now

36
00:06:39,194 --> 00:06:49,886
The flowers are long-lasting and have many branches on the same branch.

37
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:02,452
This orchid I grow semi-hydroponic with pine bark

38
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:12,881
Flowers bloom brilliantly, boldly, and last longer

39
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:24,879
growing semi-hydroponic orchids, the moisture is always well maintained,

40
00:07:24,371 --> 00:07:29,878
the roots will grow very quickly

41
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:37,876
It will help plants perform metabolism, absorb organic fertilizer and water very well.

42
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:48,874
 With this simple planting method, we will get orchids that grow faster.

43
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:54,873
Hope the video will help you a lot.

44
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:12,870
Next, I share an organic fertilizer that every home has to restore wilted and weak orchids.

45
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:22,868
Subscribe to the channel so you don't miss any orchid care tips on my channel.

46
00:08:39,564 --> 00:08:49,896
If not restored, the orchid will die or will never bloom.

47
00:08:57,894 --> 00:09:07,892
First you need to cut off all damaged roots.

48
00:09:34,887 --> 00:09:41,885
and cut dried flower stems.

49
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:59,882
Fix the orchid so that it will not damage the roots when it roots later.

50
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:20,878
Then take 5 spoons of rice.

51
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:40,874
Add 2 liters of water at room temperature.

52
00:10:43,873 --> 00:10:50,872
Wait 30 minutes before using.

53
00:11:03,869 --> 00:11:09,868
then take 2 spoons of milk.

54
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:28,897
Add 1 liter of water at room temperature.

55
00:11:45,894 --> 00:11:55,892
Then thoroughly wipe the top and bottom of the leaf.

56
00:11:55,892 --> 00:12:06,890
This helps remove dirt, fungus and disease-causing bacteria on orchids.

57
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:18,887
At the same time, adding nutrients through the leaves helps the orchid recover quickly

58
00:12:25,886 --> 00:12:28,886
after 30 minutes.

59
00:12:53,881 --> 00:13:03,879
Mix milk solution with rice water as fertilizer.

60
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:22,875
Adding moss helps retain moisture better.

61
00:13:35,872 --> 00:13:45,870
From now on, water your orchids with this liquid fertilizer once a week.

62
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:55,868
Should be done in the morning before the sun is hot.

63
00:13:59,867 --> 00:14:09,899
On normal days, the substrate is dry, just watering to keep it moist is enough.

64
00:14:17,897 --> 00:14:26,895
Place the orchid pot in a cool, well-lit place and the plant will recover faster and the plant will be healthy.

65
00:14:28,895 --> 00:14:32,894
1 Month Later

66
00:14:37,893 --> 00:14:46,892
The orchid has developed many new roots.

67
00:14:54,890 --> 00:15:03,888
Many branched roots develop to help absorb nutrients and water better.

68
00:15:21,885 --> 00:15:30,883
Hopefully the video will help you a lot in taking better care of orchids at home.

69
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:59,877
Thank you for watching the video. Good luck and see you in the next videos.
