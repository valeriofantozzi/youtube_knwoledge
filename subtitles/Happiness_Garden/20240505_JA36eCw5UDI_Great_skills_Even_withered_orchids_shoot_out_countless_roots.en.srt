Welcome to my Happiness Garden channel.

2
00:00:34,945 --> 00:00:44,925
If you plant a lot of orchids, the spread of rotten orchids due to bacteria or fungi is unavoidable.

3
00:00:47,846 --> 00:00:57,822
In this video I show you how to get your rotten orchid to recover and grow quickly.

4
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:11,753
First, check if the roots are healthy.

5
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:52,571
This orchid of mine has all roots damaged.

6
00:01:52,571 --> 00:02:03,213
so I will cut all the rotten part from the orchid.

7
00:02:10,773 --> 00:02:22,739
Then rinse with water.

8
00:02:45,556 --> 00:02:57,565
then wipe dry.

9
00:03:17,607 --> 00:03:32,837
Apply toothpaste on the cut.

10
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:48,189
This helps the cut heal faster and protects the orchid from rot.

11
00:03:55,923 --> 00:04:03,919
Take 1 aloe leaf.

12
00:04:14,317 --> 00:04:24,315
sliced.

13
00:04:52,333 --> 00:05:02,307
Add 1 teaspoon of honey.

14
00:05:11,827 --> 00:05:20,383
Add 500ml of water at room temperature.

15
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:31,527
Stir well so that the nutrients from the aloe vera gel and honey dissolve into the water.

16
00:05:50,831 --> 00:06:01,262
Soak orchid branches in this water for 30 minutes.

17
00:06:21,496 --> 00:06:29,832
Put 500ml of warm water in the bottle.

18
00:06:30,272 --> 00:06:40,860
add 1 teaspoon of cinnamon powder.

19
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:07,591
Allow 30 minutes for the drug to dissolve in water to be used.

20
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:40,637
After 30 minutes of soaking, filter out the residue.

21
00:07:54,876 --> 00:08:15,261
Soak moss in cinnamon water for 30 minutes.

22
00:08:50,186 --> 00:09:00,160
Put the orchid in a bottle and mist it to keep it moist every 5 days.

23
00:09:11,561 --> 00:09:18,097
Put in a cool place to wait for the orchid to take root.

24
00:09:26,143 --> 00:09:32,278
1 MONTH LATER.

25
00:09:35,546 --> 00:09:45,518
With this simple way, after 1 month the orchid has taken root

26
00:09:51,812 --> 00:09:59,782
Roots grow very healthy.

27
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:19,644
If you find it interesting, remember to subscribe to my support channel.

28
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:34,142
Now I will plant it in a pot so that the orchid can grow in the outside environment.

29
00:10:46,795 --> 00:10:52,986
Plastic seeds for growing hydroponic vegetables are placed at the bottom of the pot.

30
00:10:54,971 --> 00:11:04,886
On the face is moss to help retain moisture better.

31
00:11:24,396 --> 00:11:34,363
After planting, water and care like other normal plants.

32
00:11:35,422 --> 00:11:44,394
Hope the video will help you a lot.

33
00:11:45,515 --> 00:11:54,492
Wish you success and always happy in life.

34
00:11:54,492 --> 00:11:59,034
Goodbye and see you in the next videos.
