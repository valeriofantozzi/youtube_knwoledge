Nice to meet you on my channel.

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,200
You see here a withered orchid. Maybe

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,559
it's because you didn't water it or due

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,559
to direct sunlight shining on the

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,559
orchid.

Leave a comment to let me know which

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,400
country you are watching from. It's

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:29,160
truly wonderful that we can connect and

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,160

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,600
with you.

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,559
You need one aloe vera leaf.

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,720
This aloe vera gel is great for reviving

31
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,320
In addition, aloe vera also contains

32
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,520
vitamins A, B, and C and minerals such

33
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,520

38
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,599
Next, take one liter of warm water and

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,599
put it in the bottle.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,680
Then take one spoon of rice and soak it

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,440
in this water for about 30 minutes. Let

43
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,319

46
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,680

49
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,720

[Music]

51
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,250
Filter out residue. Then add 2 L of

52
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:42,560

54
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,960

59
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,680
So I ended up with about 3 L of this

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:59,680
wonderful liquid manure solution.

00:05:25,680 --> 00:06:01,440
[Music]

62
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,250
Cover the pot with moss to retain

63
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:16,489
moisture better.

[Music]

65
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,440
Now you use the solution to water the

66
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:44,580
orchid every 5 days.

71
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,160

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,020
lift the orchid pot and place it in a

73
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:21,060

75
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,000

80
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,319
New roots develop very well.

83
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:11,639
New roots will help transport water and

84
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,639
nutrients from the roots to the stem.

85
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,440
If the leaves are provided with enough

86
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:24,000
water and nutrients from the roots, the

87
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,000
leaves will gradually become lush again.

88
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,640
One month later,

89
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,279
you see the leaves are very fresh.

90
00:08:51,050 --> 00:09:11,929

91
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,920
And the orchid grows a new leaf.

92
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,600
After the next two months,

93
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,839
the orchid has grown two branches, two

94
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,839
buds,

95
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,720
but the leaves at the base have turned

96
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,970
yellow. So I will cut off these yellow

97
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:07,519
leaves.

99
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,880
Uh instinctively when an orchid buds, if

100
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,800
the plant lacks nutrients, the the base

101
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,320
leaves will turn yellow and fall off to

102
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,320
provide nutrients for the buds to

103
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,320
develop.

00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:33,040
[Music]

105
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,120
Now I need to supplement the orchid's

106
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,950
nutrition by taking three spoons of

107
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:46,480

109
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,760

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,810
completely dissolve in water before

114
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,519

116
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:13,580

118
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,600

Rice water and milk are excellent

121
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,420
sources of nutrients for orchids to

122
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,620

Now you water the orchid with this

126
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,640
solution once a week to help the orchid

127
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,640
recover quickly.

128
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,880

the next one month,

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,880
you may notice that after about 3 to

132
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,040
four applications of liquid fertilizer,

133
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,639
made from milk and rice water, the

134
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,000
orchid has already started to sprout

135
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,760
many new roots.

136
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,760
And when the root system develops

137
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,320
strongly, the plant will absorb enough

138
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,160
water and essential nutrients. As a

139
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,639

140
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,639

141
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,360
And this is the result after the

142
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,440
following month. You can easily notice

143
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,519
that the orchid has started to grow new

recovering, the orchid unexpectedly grew

158
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:45,279
two new flower spikes. Both are
