The first mistake is watering too much.

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,960
When the roots are submerged in water

33
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,720
for a long time, they will become water

34
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,250
logged and rot quickly, causing the

35
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:47,439
plant to weaken.

pot after watering without noticing.

39
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,040
This is the main cause of root rot.

40
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,320
Another mistake is watering at night. At

41
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,600
that time, high humidity and low

42
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,319

43
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,080
susceptible to fungal diseases. Water in

44
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:13,760

45
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:20,640

schedule without paying attention to the

49

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,440
medium is already moist but more water

51
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,959

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,720

60
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,879

The solution is very simple. Only water

when the roots start turning silvery

68
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:43,239

69
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,239
thirsty and ready to absorb water.

70
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,000
Check the growing medium regularly. If

71
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,519
you see that it has dried out like this,

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,519
that's the right time to water the

73
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,519

Watering in the morning is best as it

gives the plant time to dry out during

192
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,920

195
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,440
Mistake three, placing in the wrong

196
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,360
location. When you place the orchid pot

197
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,240
under strong sunlight, the leaves can

198
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:26,320
get sunburned, turn yellow, and wilt,

199
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,399
causing the plant to lose vitality.

200
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,079
These are sunburned orchid leaves, a

201
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,959
sign that the plant has been exposed to

202
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,959
too much strong light.

203
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,399
[Music]

204
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,839
And here is an orchid pot placed under

205
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,880
strong sunlight, causing the plant to be

206
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,880
stressed and the leaves to wilt.

207
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:02,579
[Music]

208
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,360
And this causes many leaves at the base

209
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,360
of the plant to turn yellow.

210
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:15,190

[Music]

212
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,640
And you can see the roots also become

213
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:48,149
dried out due to the intense sunlight.

214
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:48,149
[Music]

215
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,199
But when the orchid is placed in low

216
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,279
light conditions, such as indoors or in

217
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:03,480
an office, the leaves become dull and

218
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,480
pale and the plant grows poorly.

219
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,800
Lack of light makes the orchid leaves

220
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,560
pale instead of deep green, causing the

221
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,560
plant to weaken and have difficulty

222
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,560
blooming.

223
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,880
Orchids grown in the shade for too long

224
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,079
will develop dull and soft leaves

225
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,440
lacking vitality.

226
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,360
Insufficient light reduces the

227
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,120
photosynthesis process causing the

228
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,360
orchid leaves to fade and the plant to

229
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,360
grow slowly.

230
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:41,920
Correct placement. Vibrant orchids.

231
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,440
Preferably place the orchid pot on a

232
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,440
window sill where there is gentle

233
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,560
sunlight and moderate air flow which is

234
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,560
ideal for healthy plant growth.

235
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,040
The best sunlight for orchids is morning

236
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,880
sun or late afternoon sun, helping the

237
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,880
plant grow healthily without burning the

238
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,880
leaves.

239
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,720
When the plant receives enough light,

240
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:09,320
the leaves become glossy and firm,

241
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,320
showing the orchid's strong vitality.

242
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,720
When the leaves are green and firm, it

243
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,560
helps the orchid grow healthy, absorb

244
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,360
nutrients well, and prepare to bloom

245
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,199
beautifully.

246
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,519
When you place the orchid pot in the

247
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,680
right location, the roots will also grow

248
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,680
strong and healthy, absorbing nutrients

249
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,680
efficiently.

250
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,480
The fourth mistake is overfertilizing.

252
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,839
When you sprinkle too much chemical

253
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,839
fertilizer on each orchid pot, the roots

254
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,920
will burn, causing the plant to weaken,

255
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,959
the leaves to yellow, and making it

256
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,959
difficult to bloom.

[Music]

259
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,199
This orchid has been overfertilized with

260
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,759
inorganic fertilizer causing the roots

261
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:07,079
to burn and affecting the overall health

262
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,079
of the plant.

263
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,519
When the roots are burned, they can no

264
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,440
longer absorb water and nutrients and

265
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:23,240
gradually the leaves will turn yellow

266
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,240
and the plant will weaken.

267
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,440
The leaves near the base will turn

268
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,920
yellow first and then the yellow

269
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,480
gradually spreads to to the leaves at

270
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,480
the top of the plant.

272

And if you use natural fertilizers,

273
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,320
remember to dilute them before watering

274
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,639
so the roots don't burn and the plant

275
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,639
grows healthy.

276
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,559
Moderate fertilizing equals healthy

277
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,160
roots.

278
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,480
Solution. When using chemical

279
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,400
fertilizers, it's best to dilute about/4

280
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,400
to half of the recommended dose and

281
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,400
apply to the plant about once every 2

282
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,400
weeks.

in previous videos on the channel.

287
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,280
If this is your first time using

288
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,039
fertilizer, start with a very light dose

289
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:45,000
so the plant can gradually get used to

290
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,000
it and avoid shocking the roots.
