Hi everybody

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:10,298
In this video, I continue to share a new method to help revive orchids with yellow leaves

3
00:00:25,546 --> 00:00:32,894
If you have an orchid like this, remove all the leaves and cut off any damaged roots

4
00:00:42,047 --> 00:00:48,891
Where are you from?

5
00:00:48,891 --> 00:00:55,037

9
00:01:43,101 --> 00:01:49,879
Then rinse with water

10
00:02:07,825 --> 00:02:12,874
Take 500ml of water

11
00:02:15,692 --> 00:02:22,872
This is hydrogen peroxide

12
00:02:37,546 --> 00:02:45,868
Take 50ml of hydrogen peroxide and mix it well in water

13
00:02:52,163 --> 00:03:00,131
Soaking orchid branches in this water for 10 minutes helps eliminate fungal diseases that damage orchids

14
00:03:02,197 --> 00:03:10,896
10 minutes later, take the dry moss and plant the orchid in a pot

15
00:03:53,745 --> 00:04:00,886
Place in a cool place for 1 week and do not water to avoid further rot

16
00:04:05,924 --> 00:04:11,884
after 1 week later

17
00:04:12,026 --> 00:04:20,882
Continue to soak 5 spoons of rice in 1 liter of water

18
00:04:43,504 --> 00:04:50,876
Then every 10 days, water the orchid with this rice water to help retain moisture

19
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:58,874
At the same time, this type of water also stimulates germination and rooting very quickly.

20
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:26,369
Soak the orchid pot in this water for 10 minutes

21
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:42,899
Then take out the orchid pot and place it in a cool place with enough light for the orchid to revive

22
00:05:49,438 --> 00:05:52,897
1 Month Later

23
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:05,728
After 1 month, the orchid branch was revived and gave birth to a baby orchid

24
00:06:56,069 --> 00:07:05,883
Continue to water the orchid with rice water every 10 days

25
00:07:24,227 --> 00:07:30,878
Soak the orchid pot in this water for 10 minutes

26
00:07:38,785 --> 00:07:46,874
Then take the orchid pot and place it in a cool place with enough light for the orchid to grow

27
00:07:52,119 --> 00:08:00,872
After 2 months, the orchid was revived and growing very healthily

28
00:08:17,633 --> 00:08:25,633
I have created many subtitles for my videos in many different languages ​​for you to choose from
