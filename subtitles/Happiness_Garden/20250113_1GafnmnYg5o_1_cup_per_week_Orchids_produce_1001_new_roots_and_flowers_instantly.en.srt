Greener remember to wipe both sides of

65
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,039
the leaf evenly because insects often

66
00:06:54,919 --> 00:07:02,000
cling to the surface of leaves helps

67
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,000

72
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,160
happens faster leaves are always green

73
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,160
and

74
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,879
healthy if the leaves are yellow or

75
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,680

don't let the growing medium get too dry

120
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:50,900
