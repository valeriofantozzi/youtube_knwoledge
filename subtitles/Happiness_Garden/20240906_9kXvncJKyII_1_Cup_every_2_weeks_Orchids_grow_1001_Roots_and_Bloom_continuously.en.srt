7
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:57,889
Cut off wilted flowers and buds as soon as you see them

8
00:01:40,792 --> 00:01:46,879
Remove yellow and rotten leaves from orchids

9
00:02:13,377 --> 00:02:19,873
Prune damaged roots

10
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:34,870
After pruning and cleaning the orchids, we proceed to make natural fertilizer to care for the orchids.

11
00:02:35,985 --> 00:02:41,968
To make this type of fertilizer, I use 

12
00:02:46,911 --> 00:02:52,900
Take 2 teaspoons

13
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:12,896
Add 500ml boiled water

14
00:03:35,202 --> 00:03:40,890
Wait 2 hours before using

15
00:03:42,559 --> 00:03:48,888
Then take 2 tablespoons of dry yeast

16
00:04:04,857 --> 00:04:10,884
Add 500ml warm water

17
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:25,881
Wait 2 hours before using

18
00:04:31,347 --> 00:04:35,879
After 2 hours

19
00:04:58,888 --> 00:05:03,874
filter the coffee water

20
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:38,900
Then use the coffee solution to wipe the orchid's leaves.

21
00:05:43,428 --> 00:05:48,898
Helps remove dirt, mold and harmful insects

22
00:05:52,068 --> 00:05:59,063
This fertilizer contains compounds that help prevent the growth of certain types of bacteria

23
00:05:59,063 --> 00:06:05,561
and some fungi that cause diseases on orchids.

24
00:06:05,561 --> 00:06:12,893
This helps reduce the risk of disease for orchids.

25
00:06:12,893 --> 00:06:18,892
Protected orchids will always be green.

26
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:22,879
Thoroughly wipe the underside of the leaf

27
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:30,878
because fungi, bacteria and insects often concentrate and thrive on the underside of leaves

28
00:07:30,878 --> 00:07:36,877
before damaging the upper surface of the leaves

29
00:07:56,873 --> 00:08:03,871
This is where insects, fungi and bacteria wreak havoc on the underside of leaves

30
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:20,217
Wipe as soon as the leaves are still healthy so the orchid is protected

31
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:33,899
Mix the coffee solution with the yeast solution

32
00:08:50,536 --> 00:08:56,894
Add 1 liter of water at room temperature

33
00:09:20,707 --> 00:09:22,889
Method 1

34
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:28,888
You use a spray bottle containing this type of fertilizer

35
00:09:33,887 --> 00:09:39,885
and mist irrigation for all orchids.

36
00:09:44,803 --> 00:09:51,883
It has the same effect as foliar fertilization for orchids.

37
00:09:56,378 --> 00:10:02,881
Fertilize every 2 weeks to supplement nutrition for orchids

38
00:10:46,698 --> 00:10:49,872
Method 2

39
00:10:52,668 --> 00:10:59,870
You water each orchid with this liquid fertilizer.

40
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:07,935
This type of fertilizer contains many minerals such as Nitrogen, 

41
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:13,967
Phosphorus, potassium, carbohydrates, calcium, iron, magnesium,Vitamin C, E, vitamin B,...

42
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:19,966
are important nutrients for orchid growth.

43
00:11:20,682 --> 00:11:27,460
It helps retain water in the orchid growing medium

44
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:34,459
Helps maintain stable soil moisture, especially in dry weather.

45
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:41,895
You can soak your orchid pots in this fertilizer for about 20-30 minutes and it will be very effective

46
00:11:44,014 --> 00:11:50,993
After 30 minutes, take the orchid pot out and place it in a cool, well-lit place

47
00:11:54,319 --> 00:12:00,891
You should fertilize orchids 1-2 times/month for best growth

48
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:10,289
Results after 3 weeks

49
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:20,887
Many new roots grow

50
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:36,017
Leaves are green and sturdy, healthier

51
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:56,113
Thick and strong roots will help the orchid absorb the most nutrients through the roots

52
00:12:59,093 --> 00:13:06,078
The flowers stay on the branches for a long time and grow many new buds

53
00:13:13,914 --> 00:13:20,908
The root system is important for the growth of orchids

54
00:13:34,622 --> 00:13:40,871
The health of orchids depends greatly on the root system

55
00:13:46,024 --> 00:13:53,008
When the orchid absorbs enough nutrients, the flower branches continuously produce new buds

56
00:13:54,861 --> 00:14:00,900
Other types of orchids are treated with coffee-based fertilizers and baking powder

57
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,899
Their roots also grow healthily

58
00:14:35,893 --> 00:14:40,892
Hope you will like this fertilizer.

59
00:15:02,288 --> 00:15:10,886
