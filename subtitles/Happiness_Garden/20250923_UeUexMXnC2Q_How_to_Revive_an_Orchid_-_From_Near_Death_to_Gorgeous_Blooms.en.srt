And have you ever faced a situation

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,679
where your orchid has lost all its

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,840
leaves while the flowers remain fresh

11
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,360
and vibrant?

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,440
It's really hard to decide because if

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,390
you cut off the blooming flowers, it

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,879
feels like such a waste.

[Music]

16
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,879
But if we keep them, we also need to

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,120
know how to care for the plant so it

18
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,600
doesn't become exhausted and can still

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,039
recover from the roots. Um, in this

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,120
video I will share how to keep the

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,550
flowers fresh for longer while helping

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,520
the orchid regain strong vitality.

[Music]

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,079
First, you need to remove the old pot if

25
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,119
it no longer provides enough space for

26
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,680
the roots to grow.

27
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,000
As you can see, the cramped pot space

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,920
combined with an overly wet environment

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,840
has caused many of the orchids roots to

30
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:18,240
develop dark brown rot spots.

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,880
uh these roots are not only ineffective

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,520
at absorbing nutrients but can also

33
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,600
spread disease to the healthy roots.

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,680
Therefore, treating the rotten roots and

35
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,840
creating a well ventilated environment

36
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,920
for the plant is an important step for

37
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,400
the orchid to recover and grow strong

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:40,400
again.

39
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:42,479
[Music]

40
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,119
Therefore, we need to quickly remove the

41
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,439
damaged roots to prevent the spread of

42
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,840
disease and help the plant focus its

43
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,680
nutrients on the healthy roots. This

44
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,399
will create the right conditions for new

45
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,799
roots to grow strongly while also

46
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,520
enhancing the orchid's ability to absorb

47
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,759
water and nutrients. Once the roots are

48
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,320
healthy again, the orchid will have a

49
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,870
solid foundation for lush green leaves

50
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:15,419
and more vibrant blooms.

52
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,840
After removing the damaged roots, we

53
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,720
should only discard about half of the

54
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,480
old growing medium, not all of it.

55
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,800
Keeping some of the medium helps retain

56
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,120
beneficial microorganisms and supports

57
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,920
the new roots to anchor firmly and grow

58
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,239
well. This also reduces transplant

59
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,400
shock, creating a stable environment for

60
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:42,280
the orchid to gradually recover and

61
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,280
continue blooming beautifully.

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,160
on the stem to prevent it from spreading

65
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,000
to the healthy parts. This creates

66
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,959
favorable conditions for the orchid to

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,800

develop strongly.

70
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,640
When both the stem and roots are

71
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,640
healthy, the orchid will recover

72
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,640

Next, remove the flowers that are about

76
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,480
to wither, which helps the plant focus

its energy on developing new roots and

78
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,360

79
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,840
the orchid no longer has to distribute

80
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,519
nutrients to the flowers, allowing the

81
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,300
roots and leaves to recover more

91
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,639

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,160

101
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,280
Then gently pour this mixture over the

Next, the growing medium used for

142
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,599

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,200
it will become a safe environment,

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,640
help the orchid recover quickly after

157
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,720
replanting. This is an important step to

Banana GE is very rich in potassium and

phosphorus, which help stimulate root

174
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,920

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,560
Then gently take the orchid out as well

196
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,720
and let the remaining old medium on the

197
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,320
roots drain. This helps prevent the

198
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,320
plant from being too wet when

199
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,090

When the growing medium is dry enough,

203
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,519
we proceed to replant the orchid so that

204
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,680
the roots can easily anchor and absorb

205
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,959
nutrients, helping the plant recover

206
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,959
quickly and grow strong.

207
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,600
At the bottom of the pot, I place a few

208
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,160
pieces of foam to create ventilation,

209
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,640
keeping the roots airrated and reducing

210
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,399
water logging.

212
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,320
At the same time, I use these foam

213
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,320
pieces to secure the support stick,

214
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,079

216
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,680
This way, the orchid stands firm. The

217
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,000
roots can easily attach to the new

218
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,079
medium and grow more evenly, allowing

219
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,320
the plant to recover quickly and bloom

220
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,320

Then gently fill the growing medium

223
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,639
around the base of the plant. When

224
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,800
filling, be careful not to pack it too

225
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,360
tightly so the roots still have space to

226
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,120
breathe and grow freely.

227
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,120
At the same time, avoid leaving the

228
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,519
medium too loose as the plant won't

229
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,560
stand firmly and may wobble, causing

230
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:37,200
damage to the young roots. A moderate

231
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,800
firmness will keep the plant stable,

232
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,320
creating a well ventilated environment

in a cool, well ventilated area and

237
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,639
avoid direct sunlight for about 1 day.

Remember, no matter how good the
