00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:05,033 --> 00:00:12,898
If you want orchids to bloom a lot.

3
00:00:15,164 --> 00:00:22,896
Orchids always grow healthily.

4
00:00:25,427 --> 00:00:32,894
The flowers stay on the branches for a long time before fading.

5
00:00:36,256 --> 00:00:43,892
So let's explore organic fertilizers with me in this video.

6
00:00:46,141 --> 00:00:55,889
To make safe and effective compost I will use tomatoes.

7
00:01:07,996 --> 00:01:17,885
I used about 50 grams of tomatoes.

8
00:01:28,592 --> 00:01:38,881
Then puree with 500ml of water.

9
00:01:48,946 --> 00:01:58,877
Filter out residue.

10
00:02:06,276 --> 00:02:16,873
Then add water to get 5 liters of liquid fertilizer.

11
00:02:22,984 --> 00:02:32,870
METHOD 1: Fertilize orchid roots.

12
00:02:35,741 --> 00:02:46,867
This type of fertilizer contains nutrients necessary for plant growth,

13
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:56,899
includes nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), as well as minerals

14
00:03:01,149 --> 00:03:10,896
and trace elements such as magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn) and manganese. (Mn).

15
00:03:10,896 --> 00:03:20,894
These substances help orchids grow healthily, flower and promote photosynthesis.

16
00:03:26,893 --> 00:03:32,892
Method 2: Clean the leaves.

17
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:46,889
Clean the top and bottom of the leaves with this water.

18
00:03:54,814 --> 00:04:04,885
Helps kill fungi, insects, and harmful bacteria very effectively.

19
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:47,877
If you do this once a month, the leaves will stay green and disease-free.
 

20
00:05:04,873 --> 00:05:08,873
THIRD METHOD.

21
00:05:17,044 --> 00:05:28,935
You can also spray this fertilizer on the entire orchid plant.

22
00:05:28,935 --> 00:05:37,887
Like foliar fertilization for orchids.

23
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:52,897
This type of fertilizer also helps orchids grow healthily, flower and promote photosynthesis.

24
00:05:54,530 --> 00:06:02,895
Apply foliar fertilization 1-2 times a month to help increase flower production on orchids, 

25
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:09,894
causing the plant to bloom more and prolong blooming time.

26
00:06:11,096 --> 00:06:15,893
RESULT.

27
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:28,890
After 3 weeks new roots begin to grow.

28
00:06:48,354 --> 00:06:56,885
After 5 weeks, the roots developed a lot.

29
00:06:58,884 --> 00:07:11,882
This helps the plant roots absorb the most nutrients through the roots.

30
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:25,879
Sprouts also reproduce quickly.

31
00:07:30,078 --> 00:07:40,876
Each pot will grow more sprouts.

32
00:08:08,973 --> 00:08:18,868
Each orchid grows many buds.

33
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:36,898
Flowers bloom with more vibrant colors.

34
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:54,895
Flowers bloom for a long time.

35
00:08:56,616 --> 00:09:06,892

00:09:08,432 --> 00:09:17,890
