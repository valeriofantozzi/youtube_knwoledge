00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,233
Hello friends.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,899
Nice to meet you on my channel.

3
00:00:08,899 --> 00:00:15,897
You see here a withered orchid.

4
00:00:15,897 --> 00:00:22,896
Maybe it's because you didn't water it.

5
00:00:22,896 --> 00:00:31,894
or due to direct sunlight shining on the orchid.

6
00:00:31,894 --> 00:00:40,892
If you want orchids to be nourished and grow quickly.

7
00:00:40,892 --> 00:00:47,891
Please watch this video carefully.

8
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:55,490
Now I will share this amazing trick with you.

9
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:14,886
You need 1 aloe vera leaf.

10
00:01:14,886 --> 00:01:28,883
This aloe vera gel is great for reviving orchids.

11
00:01:28,883 --> 00:01:43,880
Now apply aloe vera gel on the top and bottom of the leaf.

12
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:54,878
Aloe vera gel has a very good moisturizing effect.

13
00:01:54,878 --> 00:02:06,875
In addition, aloe vera also contains vitamins A, B, and C

14
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:18,873
and minerals such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.

15
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:30,871
Do this every 5 days and leave the orchid pot in a cool place for 3 weeks.

16
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:43,868
Next, take 1 liter of warm water and put it in the bottle.

17
00:02:43,868 --> 00:03:00,898
Then take 1 spoon of rice and soak it in this water for about 30 minutes.

18
00:03:00,898 --> 00:03:11,896
Let the nutrients in the rice completely dissolve into the water.

19
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:21,894
Chop the remaining aloe vera leaves into small pieces.

20
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:50,888
Then puree with 300ml of water.

21
00:04:06,885 --> 00:04:18,883
Filter out residue half past four Add 2 liters of water at room temperature.

22
00:04:42,956 --> 00:04:54,942
After soaking for 30 minutes, filter this rice water.

23
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:16,871
Mix rice water with aloe vera juice.

24
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:29,868
So I ended up with about 3 liters of this wonderful liquid manure solution.

25
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:09,894
Cover the pot with moss to retain moisture better.

26
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:32,889
Now you use this solution to water the orchid every 5 days.

27
00:06:47,886 --> 00:06:57,884
Soak the orchid pot in this water for 2 hours.

28
00:07:02,981 --> 00:07:12,948
After soaking for 2 hours, remember to lift the orchid pot and place it in a cool place to let the orchid recover.

29
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,879
2 WEEKS LATER.

30
00:07:29,878 --> 00:07:36,877
Fertilize after 2 weeks for fresher orchid leaves.

31
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:46,875
New roots develop very well.

32
00:07:50,874 --> 00:07:59,872
Many new roots are growing.

33
00:08:04,871 --> 00:08:14,869
New roots will help transport water and nutrients from the roots to the stem.

34
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:24,867
If the leaves are provided with enough water and nutrients from the roots,

35
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:32,899
The leaves will gradually become lush again.

36
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:42,897
1 MONTH LATER.

37
00:08:45,896 --> 00:08:55,894
You see the leaves are very fresh.

38
00:09:14,891 --> 00:09:24,889
and the orchid grows a new leaf.

39
00:09:34,887 --> 00:09:38,886
after the next 2 months

40
00:09:39,886 --> 00:09:50,883
The orchid has grown two branches (two buds).

41
00:09:52,883 --> 00:10:02,881
But the leaves at the base have turned yellow so I will cut off these yellow leaves.

42
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:16,878
Instinctively, when an orchid buds, if the plant lacks nutrients,

43
00:10:16,878 --> 00:10:26,876
the base leaves will turn yellow and fall off to provide nutrients for the buds to develop.

44
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:42,873
Now I need to supplement the orchid's nutrition by taking 3 spoons of rice.

45
00:10:47,872 --> 00:10:56,870
Then soak in 2 liters of water at room temperature

46
00:10:58,026 --> 00:11:06,868
and wait 30 minutes for the nutrients to completely dissolve in water before using.

47
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:12,734
30 Minutes Later

48
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:26,898
Add 3 tablespoons of milk

49
00:11:33,896 --> 00:11:43,894
Rice water and milk are excellent sources of nutrients for orchids to grow

50
00:11:50,893 --> 00:12:00,891
Now you water the orchid with this solution once a week to help the orchid recover quickly.

51
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:22,887
After the next 1 month.

52
00:12:23,886 --> 00:12:31,885
After 3-4 times of applying liquid fertilizer from milk and rice water, the orchid had many roots.

53
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:40,350
When the roots grow, they will absorb enough water and nutrients

54
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:46,882
and the leaves will turn green again very quickly.

55
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:54,880
After the next 1 month.

56
00:12:56,188 --> 00:13:04,878
The orchid grew more leaves and the withered leaves were completely recovered.

57
00:13:06,324 --> 00:13:16,876
Roots grow very healthily.

58
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:36,872
The leaves have completely recovered so they are very sturdy and green.

59
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:46,870
Many buds develop.

60
00:14:18,294 --> 00:14:28,895
The flowers have bright colors and hang on the branches for a long time before fading.

61
00:14:36,264 --> 00:14:42,892
Hope the video will help you a lot.

62
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:56,690
Hello friends.

63
00:14:59,449 --> 00:15:10,000
This orchid has yellow leaf disease.

64
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:21,751
The cause is due to insects sucking tree sap and then being infected with fungi and bacteria through insect bites.

65
00:15:24,751 --> 00:15:34,749
This disease leaves the leaves still succulent but falls off very quickly.

66
00:15:39,748 --> 00:15:49,593
Only one healthy leaf remains. The rest are infected.

67
00:15:49,593 --> 00:15:59,591
I cut here to check for disease inside the stem.

68
00:16:07,863 --> 00:16:17,840
All infected leaves need to be removed.

69
00:16:29,838 --> 00:16:39,336
Black spots are where the disease resides so they need to be removed.

70
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:19,895
then take 5 spoons of cement.

71
00:17:31,907 --> 00:17:41,890
Mix 5 liters of water.

72
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:59,887
Then wait for the sediment to settle.

73
00:18:12,056 --> 00:18:20,049
10 Minutes later.

74
00:18:23,747 --> 00:18:33,713
Take only the clear water at the top.

75
00:18:52,226 --> 00:19:02,208
Clean orchid branches with cement water.

76
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:10,011
Soak the orchid pot in cement water for 10 minutes

77
00:20:14,941 --> 00:20:24,925
Soak the moss in cement water for 10 minutes.

78
00:20:45,473 --> 00:20:55,452
Soak 10 eggshells in 2 liters of boiled water.

79
00:20:59,727 --> 00:21:06,716
Wait for the water to cool.

80
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:20,580
In the meantime, I recycle plastic bottles into orchid nursery equipment.

81
00:22:03,294 --> 00:22:13,270
Take 3 more Vitamin B1 tablets and mix them into eggshell water.

82
00:22:33,349 --> 00:22:43,328
Soak the orchid branches in this water for 20 minutes.

83
00:22:48,616 --> 00:22:52,595
20 minutes later.

84
00:23:00,657 --> 00:23:10,625
Sprinkle cement powder on the cut.

85
00:23:54,431 --> 00:24:04,414
Place the orchid branch in.

86
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:10,032
Pour some water into the plate.

87
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:23,644
Place in a cool place, avoid direct sunlight.

88
00:24:25,681 --> 00:24:35,675
After 1 week, spray water every 5 days.

89
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:51,805
Water from eggshells and B1.

90
00:24:53,763 --> 00:24:58,737
Pour some water into the bowl.

91
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:22,543
Leave in a cool place, after 1 week spray water every 5 days.

92
00:25:38,025 --> 00:25:40,995
1 MONTH LATER.

93
00:25:44,441 --> 00:25:52,426
Roots grow very strongly.

94
00:25:54,009 --> 00:26:03,991
Now plant it in a pot so it can grow outside

95
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:20,754
Under the orchid tree, two more small orchids have grown.

96
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:30,585
Hope the video will help you a lot.

 Hello friends.

99
00:26:50,612 --> 00:26:56,580
Orchid is a tropical plant with very strong vitality

100
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:05,878
With an orchid like this, many people probably throw it away because they think it's dead

101
00:27:05,878 --> 00:27:12,877
When you see this orchid, don't rush to throw it away

102
00:27:12,877 --> 00:27:20,309
Today I will show you how to revive orchids like this quickly

103
00:27:21,996 --> 00:27:31,973
First, cut off all damaged roots

104
00:27:36,081 --> 00:27:46,071
Remember to subscribe to the channel so you don't miss any videos

105
00:28:03,169 --> 00:28:16,165
Rinse with water.

106
00:28:21,882 --> 00:28:31,861
Dry the cut

107
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:52,224
Drop the molten candle solution on the freshly cut wound

108
00:28:52,224 --> 00:29:02,222
Will help orchids not lose water and also work against fungal diseases

109
00:29:18,078 --> 00:29:26,051
Use 1 teaspoon of cinnamon powder

110
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:35,493
1 Liter of boiled water

111
00:29:39,885 --> 00:29:43,881
Close the lid and wait for the water to cool

112
00:29:49,592 --> 00:29:55,578
Now the water has cooled

113
00:30:00,001 --> 00:30:08,976
Filter out the residue

114
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:30,138
Soak orchids in cinnamon water for 30 minutes

115
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:45,068
Water the cinnamon evenly on the top and bottom of the leaves

116
00:30:45,068 --> 00:30:55,766
Cinnamon has antiseptic properties, so it helps to eliminate fungi and insects that are harmful to orchids very well

117
00:30:55,766 --> 00:31:07,455
Cinnamon also contains many minerals, vitamins and amino acids that are very beneficial for the revival of orchids

118
00:31:07,455 --> 00:31:14,201
Do this once a month to keep your orchid protected and healthy

119
00:31:15,142 --> 00:31:21,728
30 minutes after soaking in cinnamon water

120
00:31:27,105 --> 00:31:36,092
Use dry pine bark to grow orchids

121
00:31:45,161 --> 00:31:52,155
Spread 1 turn of dry moss on top of the pot

122
00:32:10,118 --> 00:32:20,116
Leave in a cool place and do not water for 1 week so that the fungus does not grow harmful

123
00:32:24,612 --> 00:32:34,580
1 week later, start watering to keep the orchid moist

124
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:47,444
Pour water into the dish at the bottom of the pot to create the right humidity for the orchid to revive quickly

125
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:59,542
Recycling plastic bottles into miniature greenhouses makes it easier for orchids to revive

126
00:33:05,181 --> 00:33:10,173
1 Month Later

127
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:28,036
Since the tree has grown roots, I use organic fertilizer made from fish waste to fertilize the orchid

128
00:33:42,664 --> 00:33:52,631
The baby orchid is still very small, so I only apply it on the outside edge of the pot to avoid causing the baby orchid to be shocked with feces

129
00:34:10,874 --> 00:34:20,859
Watering and moisturizing once a week

130
00:34:32,732 --> 00:34:36,723
2 Months Later

131
00:35:10,711 --> 00:35:15,681
From now on take care like other mature orchids

132
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:22,680
