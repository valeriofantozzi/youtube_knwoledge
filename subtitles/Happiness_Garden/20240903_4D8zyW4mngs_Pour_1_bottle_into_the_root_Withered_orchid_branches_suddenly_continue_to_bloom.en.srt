share so more people know this tip for growing orchids.

5
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:50,890
These are the branches after the flowers have faded.

6
00:00:52,010 --> 00:01:05,887
But these buttons can continue to bloom if you know how to care for them.

7
00:01:07,282 --> 00:01:28,883
This node has bloomed so it should be cut off.

8
00:02:05,801 --> 00:02:15,874
Then sprinkle cinnamon powder on the cut to help it dry quickly and prevent disease.

9
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:36,869
Then leave it for 1 day without watering until the cut is dry.

10
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:56,899
Take 1 onion and cut it into thin slices.

11
00:03:22,894 --> 00:03:32,892
Take 2 eggshells and crush them.

12
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:48,888
Egg shells contain a lot of calcium and minerals that are very beneficial for flower growth.

13
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:22,882
Add 2 liters of water and bring to a boil.

14
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:36,879
Incubate until the water cools.

15
00:04:46,877 --> 00:04:56,875
After the water cools, filter to remove residue.

16
00:05:07,895 --> 00:05:10,872
First step.

17
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:23,870
Water the orchid roots with onion and eggshell soaking water once a week.

18
00:05:30,868 --> 00:05:38,900
Helps orchids develop roots and germinate quickly.

19
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:45,899
Step 2.

20
00:05:46,898 --> 00:05:56,896
Spray this water on the leaves once a week.

21
00:05:59,998 --> 00:06:09,894
Helps supplement nutrients through leaves, helping leaves stay green.

22
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:25,891
At the same time, it repels harmful insects and increases pest resistance.

23
00:06:27,183 --> 00:06:30,890
STep 3.

24
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:46,887
Roll cotton onto the button to stimulate flowers.

25
00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:55,873
Then spray the water soaked in onions and eggshells onto this cotton pad.

26
00:07:55,873 --> 00:08:05,871
This water will help stimulate flowering very quickly.

27
00:08:06,871 --> 00:08:16,869
Do it once a week.

28
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:30,899
After incubating the cotton for about 30 minutes, we take the cotton out.

29
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:50,895
Then take the orchid pot out of this water and remember to spray water on weekdays to keep the orchid pot moist.

30
00:08:56,894 --> 00:08:59,894
1 MONTH LATER.

31
00:09:03,405 --> 00:09:13,891
Old orchid branches continue to grow new shoots.

32
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:28,888
This helps orchids bloom many times a year.

33
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:46,884
Each batch blooms many beautiful, colorful flowers

34
00:09:52,404 --> 00:09:59,882
Hope the video helps you a lot.

35
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,880

36
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:26,876
