Hello everyone. Welcome to the Happiness

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,560
Garden channel.

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,400
Today I will share a great tip for

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,800
taking care of orchids after the flowers

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,800
have faded.

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,960
This method is especially effective in

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,600
helping wilted or weak orchids recover

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,279
and grow quickly.

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,840
This Phelinopsis orchid has finished

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,400
blooming but became wilted and stunted,

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,240
so it was removed.

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,760
I picked it up with the hope of reviving

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,760
it and helping it grow strong again.

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,719
And now I will show you how to revive

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,640
it.

22
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,559
Thank you so much for watching and

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,559
sharing this passion with me.

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,600
First, we need to remove the yellowing

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,680
and damaged leaves from the orchid. Um,

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,520
this helps the plant focus its energy on

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,879
healthier parts and prevents diseases

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,879
from spreading through the damaged

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,879
leaves.

[Music]

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,960
Then, we need to check the roots and the

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,119
orchid's growing medium as after the

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,159
flowers fade, the plant often goes

34
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,130
through a resting phase or prepares for

35
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,159
a new growth cycle.

36
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,720
[Music]

37
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,040
Due to the growing medium too wet, many

38
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,600
of the orchids roots were damaged,

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,040
resulting in the plant being unable to

40
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,799
absorb enough water and nutrients.

41
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,119
This caused the orchid's leaves to start

42
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:43,200
wilting, and the plant became weak.

43
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,840
To fix this issue, we need to remove the

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,520
old growing medium and replace it with a

45
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,439
new one, ensuring that the orchid's

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,520
environment is well ventilated and not

47
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,040
water logged, allowing the roots to grow

48
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,040
healthily and the plant to recover

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,040
quickly.

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,920
[Music]

51
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,080
Next, cut off the damaged roots to stop

52
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,760
the growth of fungi and bacteria while

53
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,239
also creating space for new healthy

54
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,239
roots to grow.

55
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,440
Uh, this step not only helps the orchid

56
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,040
recover faster, but also allows the

57
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,760
plant to absorb nutrients better from

58
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,760
the new growing medium.

59
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,160
Next, cut off the wilted flower stalks

60
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,720
to help the plant focus its energy on

61
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:41,480
developing new leaves and roots rather

62
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,480
than nourishing the spent flower stems.

63
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,959
Next, we wash the orchid with water to

64
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,879
remove dust, fungus residues, bacteria,

65
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,879
or any impurities that could harm the

66
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,879
plant.

dry before moving on to the next step.

80
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:44,440
Next, take one aloe vera leaf to make a

81
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,440
natural fertilizer to revive the orchid.

82
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,680
Aloe vera has antibacterial properties,

83
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,000
helping the orchid recover quickly and

84
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,000
grow healthily.

85
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,920
Put the aloe vera leaf into 300 ml of

86
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,560
water and blend it to create a natural

87
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,560
fertilizer solution.

89
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,759
After blending, strain it through a

90
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,759
sieve to remove the coarse fibers,

91
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,000
leaving only the aloe vera gel mixed

92
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,000
with water.

93
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,120
After straining, dilute it with an

94
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:15,240
additional 0.7 L of water to get one

95
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,240
liter of aloe vera solution.

96
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,000
Next, I add three vitamin B1 tablets to

97
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,800
the aloe vera solution to enhance the

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,800
recovery effect for the orchid.

100
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,759
Step one, use a soft cloth to soak up

101
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,840
this mixture and gently wipe both the

102
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,840
top and bottom surfaces of the orchid

103
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,840

plant's recovery and growth process.

[Music]

113
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,479
After wiping the leaves, soak the entire

114
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,479
orchid in this mixture for about 20

115
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,479
minutes.

116
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,199
Soaking helps the roots absorb the

117
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,599
maximum nutrients from the aloe vera and

118
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,520
vitamin B1, supporting the stimulation

119
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,919
of new root growth and the recovery of

120
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,919
damaged cells.

121
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,120
During the soaking time, you should

122
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,879
place the plant in a cool area, avoiding

123
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,879
direct sunlight to prevent thermal

124
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,879
shock.

125
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:06,599
Next, we need to prepare the new growing

126
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,599
medium before planting.

127
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,360
I use pine bark chips for planting

128
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,440
orchids because pine bark chips are

129
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,639
breathable and retain moisture well,

130
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,639
helping the orchid grow healthily.

131
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,120
And I add a little moss to spread on top

132
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,440
of the orchid pot, helping to retain

133
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:29,400
moisture better and create a breathable

134
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,400
environment for the plant's roots.

135
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:42,680
Then pour boiling water over the pine

136
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,680
bark chips and soak the moss.

137
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,160
This helps sterilize and remove harmful

138
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,680
impurities while also making the growing

139
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,720

211
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,399
remove dirt and allowing the leaves to

212
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,910

240
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,959
You can see that the orchid has become

241
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,920
healthy again with strong root growth

242
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,920

Um, although the bottom leaves are still

244
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,000
wilted and soft, once the orchid has a

245
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,240
healthy root system that absorbs enough

246
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,760

247
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,760

the orchid has also grown two new

252
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,360

253
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,040
that the plant is developing well and

254
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,040

The orchid is in a state where the

356
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,460
flower spike is withered and the petals

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:22,259

First, we need to trim off the withered

361

362
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,080
its nutrients on the leaves, roots, and

363
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,340
new shoots instead of sustaining the

364
00:20:42,080 --> 00:21:00,480

Then remove any damaged or rotting

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,880
leaves. This helps protect the plant

368
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,720
from fungal infections as decaying or

369
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,520
damaged leaves can harbor fungi,

roots as decaying or damaged roots

374
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,000

376
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,640

Uh, in the first 24 hours after

511
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:31,279
to the new growing medium. If you water

512
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,039
immediately, the medium could become

513
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,799

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,720
plant.

[Music]

570
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,799
Um, the nutrients in the potato help

571
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,760
stimulate the growth of new leaves and

572
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,760
strengthen the root system.

573

[Music]

574
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,080
Spraying the potato water on the entire

575
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,080
plant provides the orchid with extra

576
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,720
energy to recover after periods of

577
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,720
weakness or stress.

578
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,519
Potatoes have natural antibacterial

579
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,000
properties helping to protect the plant

580
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:57,000
from mold, bacteria, and common

581
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
diseases.

582
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,720
Then water the orchid's roots with the

583
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,720
potato mixture.

584
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,919
Potassium and phosphorus in potatoes

585
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,679
help enhance root growth, particularly

586
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:18,919
by encouraging strong and widespread

587
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,919
root development.

588
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,599
When the roots are healthy and

589
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,599
well-developed, the plant can easily

590
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:29,639
absorb enough water and nutrients, which

591
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,639
helps it grow more holistically.

592
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,800
Perform leaf wiping, spraying, and

593
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,720
watering the orchid's roots with the

594
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,639
potato mixture twice a month.

595
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,720
Then place the orchid pot in a location

596
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,960
with gentle sunlight so that the plant

597
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,560
can photosynthesize, allowing the

598
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,560
natural fertilizer to work more

599
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,560
effectively.

600
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:56,320
Now, let's take a look at the results

601
00:34:53,520 --> 00:35:00,200
after 45 days of care and recovery using

602
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,200
the natural potato fertilizer.

603
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,880
Um, as you can see, the orchid has grown

604
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:11,000
new leaves and become sturdier with a

605
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,000
shinier, healthier green color.

606
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,040
Not only that, but the orchid has also

607
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,000
grown a new flower spike, which clearly

608
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:28,440
shows that this natural fertilizer has a

609
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,440
positive effect on the plant's growth.

611
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,599
I continue to care for this orchid using

612
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,440
the natural potato fertilizer by

613
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,119
following the steps of watering,

614
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,119
spraying, and wiping the leaves twice a

615
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,119
month.

616
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,440
The potato fertilizer helps the orchid

617
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:02,660
quickly recover from a weakened state or

618
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:06,800
nutrient deficiency.

[Music]

620
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,480
The appearance of a new flower spike is

621
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,720
a clear sign that the plant has received

622
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,920
the necessary support and is returning

623
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,920
to a phase of strong growth.

624
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,839
Remember

625
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,599
to place the orchid pot in a spot with

626
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:25,760
gentle sunlight so the plant can

627
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:30,119
photosynthesize, allowing the natural

628
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,119
fertilizer to work even better.

629
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,400
Now, let me invite you to see the

630
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:42,200
results after the next 3 months of care

631
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,200

much greener, sturdier, and healthier

635
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,200
than before.

636
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,400
And the orchid has even produced

637
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:04,040
multiple flower spikes at the same time

638
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,040

spikes growing at the same time, which

642
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,119
proves that the fertilizer is really

643
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:18,119
effective for recovering and caring for

Your orchid blooming with six flower

00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,359
stems at the same time is a clear sign

648
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:33,760
that the fertilizer has had a strong

649
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:37,079
effect in revitalizing and taking care

650
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,079
of the plant.

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,800
That is a great achievement and proves

00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,200
that the plant is very healthy and

653
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,280
thriving. These are the reasons why

654
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,760
