Today I will share how to restore an

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,240
orchid suffering from leaf rot so that

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,240
it can recover and grow quickly.

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,119
channel.

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,119
So, let's get started.

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,160
You can see that this orchid which was

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,840
growing healthily suddenly has some

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,840
rotting leaves in the middle of its

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,840
stem.

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,640
When you encounter an orchid with with

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,800
this type of rot, the first thing you

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,559
need to do is isolate it from the garden

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,800
to prevent the disease from spreading to

19
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,800
other plants.

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,760
The cause of this leaf rot in the orchid

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,879
is bacteria which leads to orchid soft

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,879
rot disease.

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,600
In just a few hours, they can make the

24
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,620
orchid leaves become soft, mushy, and

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,879
necrotic.

[Music]

27
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,280
If not treated quickly, the rot will

28
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,200
spread to other leaves, down the stem,

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,000
and to the roots, causing the orchid to

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,000
die rapidly.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
After isolating it from the garden, we

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,990
proceed to clean up and remove the

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,520
rotten parts from the orchid.

38
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,799
healthy parts and stimulates stronger

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,799

strong antibacterial and antifungal

If not filtered properly, cinnamon

77
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,600
powder can stick to the leaves and

78
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,080
roots, hindering the plant's respiration

79
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,960

80
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,960
promotes fungal growth.

81
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,759
Additionally, well-filtered cinnamon

82
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,560
water allows the solution to penetrate

83
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,800

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,720
Step one, soak a cotton pad in the

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,479
Cinnamon water helps eliminate bacteria

92
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,960

If the plant is healthy, wipe the leaves

once a month to prevent diseases and

109
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,479

beautiful blooms.

129
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,280
Then I spray this cinnamon water onto

130
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,759
the rotting area to clean it. This helps

131
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,680
the wound dry faster and reduces the

132
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:07,319
humid environment where bacteria and

133
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,319

134
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,639
When the rotting area is cleaned and

135
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,039
dried, the plant will recover more

136
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,919
easily, develop healthy new tissue, and

137
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,919
stimulate tissue regeneration.

138
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,440
Then spray it on the orchid leaves. This

139
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,440
helps clean them and support

140
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,960
photosynthesis by removing dust,

141
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,919

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,560

be diluted with water as I've instructed

193
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,000
to avoid overloading the plant with

194
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,000
nutrients or causing excessive

195
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
fermentation.

197
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,279
Step four, water the orchid pot with the

198
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,120
cinnamon and beer mixture to help the

199
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,280
orchid recover faster and grow

200
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,490
healthier.

When watering, slowly pour the mixture

203
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,519
around the base of the plant, avoiding

204
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:17,399
direct contact with the leaves and crown

205
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,399
to prevent water accumulation.

Water in the morning or late afternoon

208
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,079
to help the plant absorb nutrients

209
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:31,320
better and prevent fermentation due to

210
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,320
high temperatures.

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,639
This mixture provides nutrients from

beer, stimulating root growth and aiding

214
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,200
in faster recovery.

215
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,480
This mixture also improves the growing

216
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,560
medium by introducing beneficial

217
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:55,000
microorganisms from beer, helping the

218
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,000
plant absorb nutrients more effectively.

219
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,880
After watering, let the roots soak in

220
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,839
this mixture for about 20 minutes to

221
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,839
enhance the recovery effect.

223
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,680
After soaking, take the orchid pot out

224

and place it in a well ventilated area

225
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,650
with gentle sunlight to enhance

226
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,770
photosynthesis and boost recovery.

Now, let's take a look at the results

229
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,760
after 3 weeks of caring for and

230
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,760
restoring the rotting orchid.

231
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,560
You can see that new roots have started

232
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,360
to grow from the previously rotting

233
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,440
area. This is a wonderful sign that the

234
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,680
orchid has recovered and is continuing

235
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,680
to thrive.

236
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,440
You can also see that the leaves are

237
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,040
greener and firmer, which proves that

238
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,360
the plant has absorbed enough nutrients

239
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:17,460
and regained its vitality.

And here is another orchid that I also

243
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,600
restored using this method. As you can

244
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:42,120
see, from the roots to the leaves, it is

245
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,120
thriving after the recovery phase.

The growing medium is dry and well

249
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,920
ventilated with no unusual odors. This

250
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,680
indicates that the environment has

251
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,680
improved, reducing the risk of fungal

252
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,680

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,680
restored using this method 3 months ago.

257
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,079
Now look at its roots. So strong and

258
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,079
healthy, right?

259
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:28,040
With this simple method, you can easily

260
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,040
restore rotten orchids at home. Right.

261
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,040
With a little patience and the right

262
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,920
approach, your orchid will quickly

263
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:40,519
recover, grow new roots, turn lush green

264
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,519
again, and may even bloom soon.

265
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,399
Keep caring for and loving your orchids,

266
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,560
and you will be rewarded with wonderful

267
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:52,160
