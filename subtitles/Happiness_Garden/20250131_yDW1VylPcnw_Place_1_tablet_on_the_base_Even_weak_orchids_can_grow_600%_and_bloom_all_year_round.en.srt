hello everyone welcome to the happiness

00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:09,800
Channel today I'll share an amazing tip

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,000
for taking care of orchids after their

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,839
flowers have faded this method is

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,750
especially effective for helping wilted

7
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,640
or weak orchids recover and grow

00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,039

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,880
quickly this is an orchid that has

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,640
already bloomed but became wilted and

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,800
stunted so it was

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,119
discarded I picked it up with the hope

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,960
of Reviving it and helping it grow

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,960
strong again let's see how I do

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,800
it first trim off the old flower Spike

16
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,200
that has long

17
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,039
withered this helps the plant redirect

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,920
nutrients to root and leaf growth

19
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:45,920
instead of sustaining the dried flower

20
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:53,059
[Music]

21
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:59,079
stem next upon checking the roots I

22
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,920
found many inorganic fertilizer pellets

23
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:01,920
in green and gray

24
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,709
[Music]

25
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:12,720
um this Orchid may have wilted because

26
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,119
the inorganic fertilizer damaged its

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,360
roots preventing it from absorbing water

28
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,799
and nutrients which caused the leaves to

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,040
wilt therefore we need to remove these

30
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,940
fertilizer pellets and treat the roots

31
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:29,180
to help the plant recover

[Music]

33
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,720
the roots are severely damaged and dry

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,840
uh this prevents the plant from

35
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,840
absorbing water and nutrients

36
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,739
[Music]

37
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:10,119
uh the next step is to trim off the

38
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,480
damaged Roots so the plant can focus on

39
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:14,480
growing new healthier ones

40
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,599
next rinse the roots thoroughly with

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,760
water this removes any remaining dirt

42
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,920

50
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:30,439
world to make natural fertilizer I first

51
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,120
take one teaspoon of honey honey

52
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:33,720
provides natural nutrients and supports

53
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,200
the plant's growth in a safe and

54
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,200
effective

55
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,000
way dilute the honey in 1 liter of

56
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,640
water this makes the solution lighter

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,560
allowing it to easily penetrate the

58
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:57,799
leaves and roots without causing harm

59
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,799

61
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,720
next I take one aloe vera leaf as it is

62
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,519
excellent for helping wilted or stunted

63
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,720

64
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:20,759
moisture and natural nutrients to help

65
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,759
the plant recover quickly and grow

66
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:31,720
strong add the aloe vera leaf to about

67
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,720
300 M of water

68
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,039
then blend the aloe vera with a blender

69
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,199
until smooth this ensures the aloe vera

70
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:55,560
is fully mixed into the water creating a

71
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,520
fine smooth solution that can easily

72
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,520
absorb into the roots and leaves of the

73
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,520

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,560
strain out any pulp or residue from the

75
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,400
aloe vera

76
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,120

77
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,120

pour the aloe vera water over it letting

83
