Today I continue to share with you a

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,240
method of caring for orchids using

natural fert fertilizer.

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,000
A simple yet effective method that helps

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,660
orchids grow fully and bloom multiple

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,480

Let's get started.

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,280
This is an orchid that has finished

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,600
blooming and is weakened. I bought it

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,840
for just $1 from a local flower shop,

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,970
hoping to revive it and bring it back to

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,240
life.

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,719
You can see that the leaves have wilted,

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,810
a clear sign that the plant is in

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,199
decline.

23
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,000
To begin the recovery process, you first

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,480
need to cut off the old and withered

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,480
flower spikes. This helps the plant

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,199
conserve energy by no longer sustaining

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,199
the non-living parts.

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,040
After that, check the roots and the

29
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,640
orchid growing medium to see if they are

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,640
still good and and safe for the plant.

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,640
I noticed that although the orchid is

32
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,400
wilted, its roots are still healthy and

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,720
the moss used as the growing medium is

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:29,200
still white and not decayed. So, there's

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,960
no need to replace it at this time.

36
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,360
You should also carefully check and cut

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,090
off any damaged roots to avoid affecting

38
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,720
the growth of the healthy ones.

What do you think about this method of

reviving a weak orchid? Leave a comment

199
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,680
Although the leaves are still wilted, as

200
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,519
the roots grow stronger, they will

201
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,360
absorb water and nutrients more

202
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,079
effectively, helping the leaves recover

203
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,760
quickly.

204
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,000
To help the orchid grow vigorously and

205
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,839
bloom soon, we need to transfer it to a

206
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,560
larger pot so the roots have space to

207
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,560
expand.

208
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,639
I chose sterilized and dried moss as the

209
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,399
orchid growing medium as it is both

210
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,720
disease-free and retains moisture well

211
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,720
for the roots.

212
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,519
Since moss retains moisture very well,

213
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,920
you only need to water it one to two

214
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,839
times a month. Overwatering can cause

215
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,839
the roots to become water logged and

216
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,839
rot.

218
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,519
Uh after repotting from now on you only

219
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,440
need to care for the orchid with the

220
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:49,480
fermented breadcrumb fertilizer about

221
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,480
one to two times a month.

[Music]

223
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,880
Or you can also alternate with other

224
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,800
types of organic fertilizers to

225
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,410
supplement nutrients and help the plant

226
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:19,350
develop more fully.

229
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,560
And don't forget to place the orchid pot

230
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,639
in a spot with gentle sunlight because

231
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,639
only when the plant photosynthesizes

232
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,580
well can it absorb nutrients to the

233
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:52,549
fullest and grow properly.

And here is the result after another 3

236
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,600
months of caring for the orchid using

237
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:04,539
this natural method.

You can see that the wilted leaves have

241
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,199
fully recovered. And even more

242
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,290
wonderfully, the orchid has grown many

243
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:24,800
new leaves.

As long as you stay patient and revive

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,199
one plant at a time, over the years,

247
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,720
you'll have a whole garden full of

248
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:38,320
