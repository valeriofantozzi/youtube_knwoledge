00:00:01,235 --> 00:00:03,235
Hello friends.

2
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:12,898
In this video, I share the method to restore love orchids.

3
00:00:12,898 --> 00:00:21,896
causes even the weakest orchids to take root immediately and bloom continuously

4
00:00:25,952 --> 00:00:36,893
This orchid has withered leaves and is so weak that it cannot bloom.

5
00:00:39,964 --> 00:00:46,958
Remove old growing medium.

6
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:58,889
Cut off all damaged roots.

7
00:01:10,124 --> 00:01:20,118
Cut off wilted flower stems.

8
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:31,782
Rinse with water

9
00:01:49,937 --> 00:01:59,910
Use 2 spoons of rice, rice is rich in polyphenols, calcium, magnesium, vitamins,...

10
00:02:01,325 --> 00:02:07,309
Add 1 liter of water.

11
00:02:11,617 --> 00:02:19,606
Take 2 spoons of cinnamon powder.

12
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:27,582
Cinnamon powder will help orchids fight bacteria and disinfect.

13
00:02:27,582 --> 00:02:34,736
At the same time, it helps the tree recover very quickly.

14
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:46,867
Add 1 liter of water to boil.

15
00:03:00,898 --> 00:03:08,896
Wait for the water to cool before using.

16
00:03:10,401 --> 00:03:13,895
1 Hour later.

17
00:03:34,441 --> 00:03:42,423
Mix cinnamon water with rice water.

18
00:03:54,604 --> 00:04:04,585
Use this water to thoroughly wipe the top and bottom of the leaves.

19
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:16,783
It will help these leaves recover so the plant doesn't get fungus.

20
00:04:19,028 --> 00:04:29,014
At the same time, adding nutrients, vitamins, and amino acids helps orchids recover quickly.

21
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:58,608
Then soak the roots in this water for 30 minutes.

22
00:04:58,608 --> 00:05:08,439
Helps destroy fungi and insects that damage roots and stimulates rapid root growth.

23
00:05:21,442 --> 00:05:25,869
30 minutes later.

24
00:05:26,902 --> 00:05:33,906
Now I grow semi-hydroponic orchids in cups like this

25
00:05:33,906 --> 00:05:41,415
Then pour water to cover 1/2 of the roots..

26
00:05:45,871 --> 00:05:52,864
When the water is dirty, change the water immediately.

27
00:05:52,864 --> 00:06:00,296
And every week you soak the roots in rice water for 30 minutes to stimulate orchid growth.

28
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:12,293
Spray moisturizer once every 3 days to keep the leaves from wilting further.

29
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:22,091
Place the orchid in a cool, well-lit place.

30
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:32,956
With this remaining water, you can take care of the blooming orchids.

31
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:46,987
It will help the orchid cling to the branch for a long time before it withers.

32
00:06:53,983 --> 00:07:01,950
Blooming flowers will have more vibrant colors than usual.

33
00:07:23,931 --> 00:07:26,912
1 Month later

34
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:40,609
The leaves have gotten stronger and have grown many new roots.

35
00:08:05,414 --> 00:08:15,402
These new roots will absorb water and nutrients better, helping wilted orchid leaves recover faster.

36
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:36,798
When the roots grow healthy like this, you can plant them in a pot to help the orchid grow better.

37
00:08:44,897 --> 00:08:54,895
My videos have subtitles in many different languages. You can choose the appropriate language.

38
00:09:03,056 --> 00:09:11,025
and you take care of it like other normal orchids.

39
00:09:13,757 --> 00:09:21,756
The orchid will quickly recover and bloom again.

40
00:09:31,786 --> 00:09:40,752
With this care, my orchid recovered and bloomed after 3 months.

41
00:09:50,517 --> 00:09:57,882
Don't rush to leave the video because part 2 will be more interesting

42
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:06,880
In my hand is a withered orchid branch

43
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:12,879
And in this video I will share so that you can propagate from any orchid branch

44
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:19,878
We cut off the spots that have bloomed

45
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:38,874
Just keep these 3 paragraphs can still sprout

46
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:46,872
Applying candle solution on the cut will help protect the orchid from rot

47
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:36,896
Peel off the protective film of the sleeping sprout

48
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:09,889
Use 1 sprig of chopped fresh ginger

49
00:12:25,886 --> 00:12:30,885
500 ml of boiled water

50
00:12:30,885 --> 00:12:33,885
wait 1 day

51
00:12:51,881 --> 00:12:57,880
Soak orchids in ginger water for 30 minutes

52
00:13:05,878 --> 00:13:10,877
Soak moss in ginger water for 30 minutes

53
00:13:33,873 --> 00:13:41,871
I use recycled plastic boxes to make miniature greenhouses to help propagate orchids faster

54
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:50,869
There's a vent here

55
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:12,898
Put the orchid in a miniature greenhouse and spray it with moisture once a week

56
00:14:17,897 --> 00:14:22,896
Place in a bright place and avoid direct sunlight

57
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:24,896
21 DAYS AFTER

58
00:14:55,890 --> 00:15:02,888
Continue misting to keep moisture and keep in a light place, avoid direct sunlight

59
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:11,887
AFTER 1O NEXT DAY

60
00:15:36,882 --> 00:15:43,880
Continue misting to keep moisture and keep in a light place, avoid direct sunlight

61
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,879
AFTER 2 NEXT WEEKS

62
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:44,868
Plant in pots to let the orchid adapt and grow in the outside environment

63
00:17:18,895 --> 00:17:27,893
If you find it interesting, please subscribe to the channel, like, share to let more people know

64
00:17:31,892 --> 00:17:40,890
My videos have subtitles in different languages. Please select the appropriate language to understand the video content clearly

65
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:48,889
Remember to plant the root higher than the pot so that the orchid does not have root rot

66
00:17:48,889 --> 00:17:53,888
That's all I want to share with you in this video

67
00:17:53,888 --> 00:17:59,887
Now goodbye and see you in the next videos
