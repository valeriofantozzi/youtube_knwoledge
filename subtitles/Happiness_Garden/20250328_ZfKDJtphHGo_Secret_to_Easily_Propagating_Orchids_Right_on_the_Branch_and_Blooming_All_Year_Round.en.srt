[Music]

201
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,399
place the Orchid propagation pot in a

202
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,880
spot with gentle sunlight and a

203
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:55,040
temperature between 23 to 28° C 73 to

204
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:58,920
82° F which is the ideal condition for

205
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,920
the Orchid cutting to sprout

206
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,480
now let's take a look at the results

207
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,480
after 45 days of

208
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,199
propagation amazing you can see that the

209
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:27,319
orchid seedlings have sprouted and

210
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:27,319
developed healthy looking

211
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,920
roots for

[Music]

213
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,240
however the Orchid is still small so

214
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:18,199
I've decided to continue nurturing it in

215
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,199
the pot until it grows bigger before

216
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,959
transplanting continue misting once a

217
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,480
week and keep the nursery pot in a spot

218
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:29,480
with gentle sunlight

220
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,880
now let's check the results after

221
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,880
another 45 days of

222
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:15,159
propagation you can see that after 90

223
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,679
days of propagation from the cutting the

224
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:21,200
orchid has grown strong with firm leaves

225
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,200
and healthy roots

227
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,400
with this simple method you can

228
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,400
propagate orchids at home by reusing

229
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,400
flower spikes after the blooms have

230
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,400
faded

me now I am planting them in pots so

240
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,720
they can grow in an outdoor environment

242
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,840
I using crushed pine bark because it

243
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:41,520
retains the necessary moisture to keep

244
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,600
the Orchid from drying out at the same

245
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:48,400
time it provides good drainage

246
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,400
preventing root rot or plant decay

248
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,720
and after planting in the pot we spread

249
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,600
a thin layer of moss on top to maintain

250
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,320
proper humidity helping the you know

251
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:16,400

255
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,840
um after planting we should water

256
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,960
regularly to maintain moisture whenever

257
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,720
the growing medium feels dry avoid

258
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,760
fertilizing until the new Roots have

259
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,760
firmly attached to the

260
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,559
