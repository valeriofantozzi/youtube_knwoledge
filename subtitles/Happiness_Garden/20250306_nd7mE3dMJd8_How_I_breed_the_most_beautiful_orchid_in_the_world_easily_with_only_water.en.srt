promote Leaf growth making them

healthier and greener

205
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:35,880
using GE enhances the leaves resistance

211
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:04,480
you put GE water in a spray

212
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:23,840

213
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,840
entire orchid

214
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,960
GE spraying promotes the comprehensive

development of plants from Roots to

216
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,520
leaves and

217
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,440
flowers spraying GE on the leaves helps

218
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:54,960
retain moisture for the plant a

00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,960

step

221
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:13,360
four water droplets on leaves can create

00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:13,360
conditions for mold and diseases to

223
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,360
thrive wiping them dry helps reduce this

224
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,080
risk when leaves are dry photosynthesis

225
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:33,200
occurs more efficiently

226
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,200
as light can directly contact the leaf

227
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:46,679
surface when leaves are dry they can

228
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,679
better absorb nutrients from sprayed

minutes take the Orchid pot out and

232
00:21:55,799 --> 00:22:01,400
place it in a place with lots of light

233
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,400

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:11,799
young Roots enhance the plant's ability
