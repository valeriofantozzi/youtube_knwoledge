66
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,039
put potato sprouts and chopped garlic in

67
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,039
a

68
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,960

71
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,199
stir well so the nutrients dissolve into

79
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,919
soaked in water to create a liquid

80
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,160
fertilizer has many wonderful effects on

81
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:30,160
caring for orchids especially after they

82
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,160
bloom

83
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:46,919
this solution contains a variety of

84
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,280
vitamins and minerals from both uh

85
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:53,240
potato sprouts and garlic providing

86
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,240
essential nutrition for orchids

87
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,159
the compounds in garlic and nutrients

88
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,199
from potato Sprouts help the plants

89
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:17,680
recover quickly after blooming improving

90
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:21,879
overall health then you let the Orchid

91
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:24,199
pot soak in this water for about 20

92
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:27,520
minutes this helps the roots absorb

93
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:27,520
water and nutrients in the best

94
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,440
way step two

95
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:40,279
you have this water in a spray

96
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,519
bottle garlic boosts the orchid's

97
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,279
resistance while potato Sprouts support

98
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,640
strong root development helping the

99
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:57,440

environmental conditions

101
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,040
then spray the entire

102
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:24,600
Orchid spray thoroughly on both the top

103
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,600
and bottom of the leaves

104
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:40,279
spraying the solution on the leaves

105
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,240
enhances moisture retention reducing

106
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:46,079
stress on the plants especially in dry

107
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,079
and hot weather conditions

108
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,000
this combination not only AIDS recovery

109
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,880
but also stimulates the next flowering

116
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,639
leave the leaves wet like

117
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,480
this you need to dry the leaves

118
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,240
immediately after spraying this Liquid

00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:10,160
when leave stay wet for too long it

fungi and bacteria to thrive wiping the

123
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,920
leaves dry helps reduce the risk of

124
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,240
disease dry leaves can absorb light more

125
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,720
effectively enhancing the photosynthesis

00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,720

stamata can open more efficiently

131
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,240
allowing the plant to better absorb

132
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,240
nutrients from the air

133
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,720
wiping the leaves dry helps prevent

134
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:21,320
excess water accumulation thereby

135
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,320
