00:00:25,378 --> 00:00:29,895
welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:32,017 --> 00:00:36,893
if you have a rotten orchid like this.

3
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:46,891
If not treated promptly, rot will spread to other trees very quickly.

4
00:00:57,889 --> 00:01:04,888
This root is rotten so it should be thrown away.

5
00:01:06,887 --> 00:01:12,886
This leaf is still fresh so it can be restored.

6
00:01:17,885 --> 00:01:22,884
Remove all rotten leaves.

7
00:01:26,883 --> 00:01:32,882
Please comment to me which country you are watching the video from!  

8
00:01:32,882 --> 00:01:37,881
It's great that we can chat together from all over the world!

9
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:42,880
then rinse with water.

10
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,879
This helps the tree recover faster.

11
00:01:52,763 --> 00:01:58,744
And this method will remove dirt and insects still attached to these leaves.

12
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:12,208
helps orchids, even though they only have one leaf, can revive faster and easier.

13
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:42,868
Cutting extra to avoid crushing the stem will help prevent the orchid from rotting further.

14

15
00:03:37,891 --> 00:03:42,890
I use coffee as a natural fertilizer to help orchids recover quickly.

16
00:03:45,387 --> 00:03:50,888
Take 1 teaspoon.

17
00:03:56,887 --> 00:04:02,886
Add 2 cups of boiling water.

18
00:04:08,885 --> 00:04:16,883
If you encounter any difficulties during the orchid growing process, don't hesitate to comment! 

19
00:04:16,883 --> 00:04:26,881
I am always ready to support you so you can grow healthy orchids and bloom lots of flowers. 🌸

20
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,880
Wait until it cools before using it as fertilizer.

21
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:46,877
After cooling, filter to remove residue.

22
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:58,875
Coffee will be very good and help orchids grow very quickly.

23
00:05:03,974 --> 00:05:09,972
In addition to the US English language, I have added voiceovers in French, German, Italian, Spanish, 

24
00:05:09,972 --> 00:05:15,971
Portuguese, Japanese, Hindi, and Indonesian to help you hear and understand the video content easier. 

25
00:05:15,971 --> 00:05:22,970
Please click on the settings on the video to select the appropriate language.

26
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:46,898
Use soft cotton pads. Wipe the leaves again and add nutrients through the leaves 

27
00:05:46,898 --> 00:05:55,897
and eliminate insects and fungi. Helps orchid leaves recover. Will not be infected with insects and fungi.

28
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:38,888
Put the leaves here and then add this coffee water.

29
00:06:40,888 --> 00:06:46,886
Leave for about 30 minutes to help the plant regenerate roots very quickly.

30
00:06:52,885 --> 00:07:00,884
and use the remaining coffee water put in spray bottle.

31
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:20,880
Spraying directly on the orchid will help the orchid grow quickly.

32
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:28,878
And remember to spray under the leaves to prevent insect growth.

33
00:07:36,906 --> 00:07:42,875
You should apply this method every 2 weeks.

34
00:07:57,873 --> 00:08:01,872
Or water orchid roots every 2 weeks.

35
00:08:02,872 --> 00:08:08,870
This is a great way to provide nutrients to orchids through the roots.

36
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:26,900
You can see that orchids cared for by this method have very healthy roots.

37
00:08:35,898 --> 00:08:42,897
A strong root system will help the orchid absorb the most nutrients.

38
00:08:58,894 --> 00:09:06,892
When absorbing enough nutrients, the plant will always be healthy and bloom many flowers.

39
00:09:12,891 --> 00:09:20,889
The flower color is bright and stays on the branch for a long time before fading.

40
00:09:35,886 --> 00:09:42,885
The mineral and nitrogen content in coffee helps leaves stay green and strong.

41
00:09:43,885 --> 00:09:50,883
Potassium in coffee helps flower buds not fall off before blooming.

42
00:09:58,882 --> 00:10:03,881
After 30 minutes, take the leaves out and wipe dry.

43
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:40,873
Use 1 clove of garlic, garlic has very good antibacterial and antiseptic properties.

44
00:11:01,303 --> 00:11:09,868
Because garlic has good antibacterial properties, it is very effective in preventing orchid rot.

45
00:11:12,867 --> 00:11:19,899
Then leave it in a cool, dry place for 1 day so that the cut will dry and the orchid leaves will recover quickly.

46
00:11:22,902 --> 00:11:28,897
Then take advantage of recycled plastic boxes into orchid growing tools.

47
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:40,895
Please cut like I do.

48
00:12:26,886 --> 00:12:32,884
Take a cotton pad and place it here.

49
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:45,882
Cotton will help absorb water better.

50
00:13:07,878 --> 00:13:11,877
Put the leaf in.

51
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:18,875
Then pour in filtered water.

52
00:13:28,873 --> 00:13:33,872
Adjust the water level so that it does not touch the base of the plant.

53
00:13:41,789 --> 00:13:47,788
And remember to add water when you feel like you're running out of water.

54
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:59,867
Cover and place in a cool, well-lit place.

55
00:13:59,867 --> 00:14:06,899
With this method, you will not need to spray mist to keep the leaves moist.

56
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:21,896
And this is the result after the next month the orchid has recovered and grown healthy roots.

57
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:51,890
The orchid has grown a new leaf.

58
00:14:54,890 --> 00:15:01,855
With these methods you need to be patient, because with orchids there will always 

59
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:09,887
be fast plants and slow plants, so when implementing these methods we need to be persistent.

60
00:15:10,886 --> 00:15:16,885
and the roots have grown very well.

61
00:15:23,884 --> 00:15:30,883
I planted it in a new pot so the orchids could grow in the outside environment.

62
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:51,878
Planting with pine bark will help the roots always breathe so the orchid will not rot.

63
00:15:55,878 --> 00:16:01,876
I always share many ways for you to easily choose

64
00:16:01,876 --> 00:16:07,875
What are the most suitable and simplest ways?

65
00:16:25,872 --> 00:16:31,870
Add a little moss to the surface of the orchid pot to help retain moisture better.

66
00:16:40,637 --> 00:16:46,867
After planting, water and keep the orchids moist.

67
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:55,899
 I have created many subtitles for you to view and choose from

68
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:00,898

69
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:10,896
