00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,998
Today we will take care of orchids with natural fertilizer from lemon.

3
00:00:10,998 --> 00:00:15,197
More precisely, lemon peel contains a lot of vitamin C and essential oils, 

4
00:00:15,197 --> 00:00:23,996
which are very beneficial for orchid care, supporting the plant's healthy growth from roots to leaves and flowers. 🍋✨

5
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:33,594
Choose 1 lemon.

6
00:00:40,892 --> 00:00:46,891
then just take the shell.

It's great that we can chat together from all over the world!

16
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:31,970
Filter out residue.

17
00:02:39,314 --> 00:02:47,301
Take 100ml of juice from lemon peel (about 1/3 cup).

18
00:02:55,564 --> 00:03:05,530
Add water to get 1 liter of solution.

19
00:03:12,511 --> 00:03:16,495
First way:

20
00:03:21,097 --> 00:03:32,092
Clean the leaves with a solution of the juice from the lemon peel.

21
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:47,255
This protects them from pests.

22
00:03:52,623 --> 00:04:01,619
Wipe the underside of the leaves carefully because this is where fungi,

23
00:04:01,619 --> 00:04:11,186
bacteria, and insects often gather to harm the orchid.

24
00:04:14,956 --> 00:04:18,949
Second way:

25
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:52,443
Spray this solution on the entire orchid.

26
00:04:57,246 --> 00:05:06,240
This helps wash away dirt,

27
00:05:10,455 --> 00:05:20,437
and eliminate fungal diseases, bacteria and harmful insects.

28
00:05:26,224 --> 00:05:36,247
Spray this mixture on orchids every 2 weeks.

29
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:47,452
But do not spray on flowers and buds.

30
00:05:47,452 --> 00:05:55,996
because wet flowers will quickly fall off.

31
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,817
3rd way:

32
00:06:06,228 --> 00:06:14,126
Now we water this solution to take care of the roots.

33
00:06:15,413 --> 00:06:25,391
Lemon peel acidifies the orchid juice, which contributes to better absorption of nutrients.

34
00:06:29,532 --> 00:06:39,642
Essential oils repel pests and protect orchid leaves and roots from harmful bacteria.

35
00:06:55,033 --> 00:07:04,973
Or soak the orchid pot in this solution for 30 minutes, it will be better.

36
00:07:05,848 --> 00:07:14,252
Do this every 2 weeks and the orchid will always be protected.

37
00:07:16,173 --> 00:07:28,930
If you don't use all of it, you can freeze the juice from the lemon zest for later use.

38
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:42,209
Now let's see the results after caring for orchids with natural fertilizer.

39
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:50,573
After 3 times of use, the roots grow very well.

40
00:08:04,472 --> 00:08:16,546
Branched roots develop to help the orchid absorb more nutrients.

41
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:30,000
Leaves are clean, always green and free from pests.

42
00:08:31,503 --> 00:08:42,296
help orchids photosynthesize better.

43
00:08:46,657 --> 00:08:54,975
flower buds grow and do not fall.

44
00:08:57,573 --> 00:09:07,684
Flowers bloom brightly and stay fresh.

45
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:19,473
Flowers stay on the branch for up to 6 months before falling.

46
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:30,188
Hope this sharing will help you a lot.

00:09:50,325 --> 00:09:58,849
Next we will explore a simple method for creating a beautiful flower season.

49
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:25,877
Surely you are wondering how to help your flower plants grow strong and vibrant, right?

50
00:10:30,976 --> 00:10:40,974
This simple method helps your orchids stay green and have lots of buds.

51
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:50,872
The buds always grow plump.

52
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:22,532
Flowers bloom well and last a long time.

53
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:31,897
New roots are always growing.

54
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:42,895
Helps orchids absorb nutrients best.

55
00:11:43,046 --> 00:11:49,893
Now let's make fertilizer together.

56
00:11:53,959 --> 00:12:02,891
This is garlic powder that every home has, right?

57
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:13,888
Take 1 teaspoon of garlic powder and add 1 liter of boiled water.

58
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:25,886
Then wait for it to cool before using.

59
00:12:32,437 --> 00:12:42,883
then filter out the residue.

60
00:13:11,811 --> 00:13:21,875
After filtering, use a towel to wipe the top and bottom of the leaves with this water.

61
00:13:27,652 --> 00:13:36,872
Garlic has antibacterial properties so it helps eliminate fungi and insects on leaves very well.

62
00:13:41,797 --> 00:13:51,869
In addition, garlic also has many natural minerals necessary for orchid growth.

63
00:13:56,875 --> 00:14:06,899
Apply once a month for better protection and growth.

64
00:14:15,262 --> 00:14:25,896
If you do this regularly, your orchids will always be green and disease-free.

65
00:14:41,613 --> 00:14:50,891
Next you can also spray this water on the entire orchid.

66
00:15:00,749 --> 00:15:10,887
This also helps provide nutrients through the leaves to the orchid.

67
00:15:12,547 --> 00:15:22,884
You should thoroughly spray both the underside of the leaves and the leaf interstices.

68
00:15:23,884 --> 00:15:33,882
Because that is where insects and fungi often reside, causing harm to orchids.

69
00:15:47,723 --> 00:15:57,877
Finally, you use this water to care for the roots.

70
00:15:59,748 --> 00:16:09,875
Water each orchid pot with about 10 tablespoons of garlic soaking water.

71
00:16:12,874 --> 00:16:22,872
This and the way you spray you apply it every 2-3 weeks.

72
00:16:25,455 --> 00:16:33,871
Garlic contains natural compounds that have antibacterial and antifungal properties.

73
00:16:33,871 --> 00:16:40,869
Helps protect orchids from pests and other harmful agents.

74
00:16:46,668 --> 00:16:56,899
Garlic powder also helps strengthen the plant's natural immune system and reduces the risk of infection.

75
00:17:01,456 --> 00:17:10,896
Nutrients found in garlic such as potassium and fosfor

76
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:19,895
, nitrogen provides essential nutrients for orchid growth.

77
00:17:26,874 --> 00:17:36,891
After 1 month of fertilizing with garlic powder, the plant has grown many new roots.

78
00:17:41,991 --> 00:17:50,888
This will help the orchid more easily absorb more nutrients.

79
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:59,887
When new roots grow a lot, it is necessary to combine the use of other types of organic fertilizers such as:

80
00:17:59,887 --> 00:18:09,885
Fish protein and soy protein follow my instructions to help orchids absorb a variety of nutrients.

81
00:18:22,882 --> 00:18:28,881
If you encounter any difficulties during the orchid growing process, don't hesitate to comment! 

82
00:18:28,881 --> 00:18:36,880
I am always ready to support you so you can grow healthy orchids and bloom lots of flowers. 🌸

83
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:56,875
Using garlic powder as fertilizer helps orchids grow strongly.

84
00:19:02,202 --> 00:19:12,872
Orchids grow many flower stems at the same time in the same orchid pot.

85
00:19:21,973 --> 00:19:31,868
Orchids become more vibrant and have a characteristic fragrance.

86
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:52,898
 Now I share how to care for Phalaenopsis orchids that bloom continuously from season to season,

87
00:20:08,592 --> 00:20:16,560
In the summer orchids often rot like this.

88
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:23,891
This is a disease caused by bacteria.

89
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:32,890
It spreads very quickly but don't worry.

90
00:20:34,076 --> 00:20:40,334
Take 1 liter of water at room temperature.

91
00:20:42,865 --> 00:20:48,587
This is an anti-rot medicine for cabbage.

92
00:20:48,886 --> 00:20:55,885
Its composition includes Steptomycin 40%.

93
00:20:55,885 --> 00:21:02,884
it will remove bacteria very quickly.

94
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:10,882
You only put in 1/4 of the tablet.

95
00:21:29,305 --> 00:21:39,876
Put it in a spray bottle and spray it all over the orchid.

96
00:21:46,446 --> 00:21:56,873
I intentionally did not remove the rotten leaves to show you how Steptomycil works.

97
00:22:00,643 --> 00:22:11,667
Any rotten areas need to be sprayed more.

98
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:23,868
Spray even disease-free leaves.

99
00:22:29,775 --> 00:22:39,898
After spraying, leave the orchid pot in a cool place and do not water for 1 week.

100
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:51,895
See results after 1 week.

101
00:22:52,916 --> 00:23:02,893
All leaves affected by bacterial rot are dry.

102
00:23:03,963 --> 00:23:13,891
Do you see the effectiveness of steptomycin against bacteria that cause orchid leaf rot?

103
00:23:26,367 --> 00:23:36,887
The rotten orchid has recovered and grown new leaves.

104
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:56,883
After recovering from the disease, recovery care is needed to help the orchid grow and bloom quickly.

105
00:24:00,582 --> 00:24:08,880
This is a multivitamin.

106
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:20,878
Dissolve 1 tablet in 1 liter of water.

107
00:24:26,877 --> 00:24:36,875
Wait for the vitamins to dissolve and then add 2 liters of water to get 3 liters of great fertilizer.

108
00:24:54,965 --> 00:25:02,936
Use cotton soaked in this water to wipe the leaves.

109
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:12,868
Helps supplement nutrition and clear stomata.

110
00:25:14,738 --> 00:25:21,899
Helps orchids photosynthesize better.

111
00:25:22,756 --> 00:25:32,897
Strong orchid leaves increase resistance to fungi and insects.

112
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:56,892
Or you can also spray this liquid fertilizer on the entire orchid.

113
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:11,334
This method works as well as mopping leaves.

114
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:29,886
Spraying evenly at the base is very good for orchids.

115
00:26:33,451 --> 00:26:43,883
But don't spray it on the flowers because if the flowers are wet they will quickly fade.

116
00:26:44,901 --> 00:26:52,552
Now you take care of the roots.

117
00:26:52,552 --> 00:26:59,029
You water this liquid fertilizer on the orchid roots.

118
00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:12,877
This helps orchids absorb the most nutrients.

119
00:27:15,393 --> 00:27:23,875
Because the roots are the main nutrient absorbers of the orchid.

120
00:27:25,574 --> 00:27:31,276
For infected plants, do this every 2 weeks.

121
00:27:33,366 --> 00:27:42,871
With normal orchids, you do this once every 1-2 months.

122
00:27:46,254 --> 00:27:52,869
helps orchids grow very quickly and increase resistance.

123
00:28:01,905 --> 00:28:11,899
It is best to soak the orchid pot in this water for 30 minutes and then take it out.

124
00:28:25,493 --> 00:28:33,894
After only 2 weeks of care, the orchid has grown many new roots.

125
00:28:53,024 --> 00:29:00,889
Many flower buds grow on the same tree.

126
00:29:03,306 --> 00:29:12,887
Thank you for watching the video. Good luck and see you in the next videos.
