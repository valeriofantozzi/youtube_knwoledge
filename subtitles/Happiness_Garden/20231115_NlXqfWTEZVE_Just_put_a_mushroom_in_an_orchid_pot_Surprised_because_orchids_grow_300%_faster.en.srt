To help you have many choices when caring for orchids at home with organic fertilizer.

00:00:14,898 --> 00:00:20,896
In this video, I continue to share new methods.

00:00:37,324 --> 00:00:47,891
First, to make this type of fertilizer you need cinnamon powder.

6
00:00:51,139 --> 00:01:03,888
Take 1 teaspoon of cinnamon powder and soak it in 1 liter of boiled water.

7
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:18,885
Then brew until the water cools.

8
00:01:21,023 --> 00:01:33,882
Next, when I eat mushrooms, I will recycle mushroom scraps to make fertilizer for orchids.

9
00:02:05,464 --> 00:02:15,874
I used about 20 grams of mushrooms.

10
00:02:18,413 --> 00:02:28,871
Add 500ml of water and puree.

11
00:02:55,048 --> 00:03:05,897
Filter out residue.

12
00:03:23,763 --> 00:03:33,891
After the water cools, filter to remove cinnamon residue.

13
00:03:58,976 --> 00:04:08,885
Mix cinnamon water and mushroom water together.

14
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:21,882
Add water to get 2 liters of liquid fertilizer.

15
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:40,878
Method 1: Wipe the top and bottom of the leaves.

16
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:55,875
This method helps eliminate fungal diseases and insects hiding on the leaves.

17
00:04:55,875 --> 00:05:05,873
And helps leaves photosynthesize sunlight to synthesize nutrients to feed plants better.

18
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:10,377
Do it 1-2 times per month.

19
00:05:17,154 --> 00:05:24,869
Method 2: spray foliar fertilizer.

20
00:05:28,401 --> 00:05:38,900
This is like you are using foliar fertilizer for orchids.

21
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:52,897
Spray all leaves, stems and roots of orchids.

22
00:05:55,489 --> 00:06:05,895
Spray thoroughly on the back of the leaves because this is where fungi and insects often hide, causing harm to orchids.

23
00:06:10,935 --> 00:06:16,893
Do it 1-2 times per month.

24
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:35,889
Method 3: Fertilize the roots.

25
00:06:38,415 --> 00:06:48,886
Mushrooms help create a good soil environment with an organic soil particle structure,

26
00:06:48,886 --> 00:06:58,884
Helps retain water and provides comfort for orchid root systems.
 

27
00:07:02,105 --> 00:07:12,082
This fertilizer increases the ability to stimulate the plant's immune system,

28
00:07:18,554 --> 00:07:28,878
Cinnamon essential oil helps repel insects from your garden without using chemicals.

29
00:07:31,898 --> 00:07:37,876
Cinnamon powder has a pleasant aroma,

30
00:07:37,876 --> 00:07:46,875
helping to create a comfortable environment for the plant and a pleasant feeling for the grower.

31
00:07:47,143 --> 00:07:51,874
Do it 1-2 times per month.

32
00:07:53,644 --> 00:07:56,873
Result.

33
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:08,870
Plant roots are protected and supplemented with nutrients so they grow very healthily.

34
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:23,867
will help orchids absorb the most nutrients.

35
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:40,897
After 2 months of spraying, the orchid has developed many flower buds.

36
00:08:53,132 --> 00:09:01,893
Each plant grows from 3-6 flower stems.

37
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:44,885
Because they are provided with enough nutrition, the flowers bloom more brilliantly.

38
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:51,301
Many flowers bloom on the same branch.

39
00:09:53,451 --> 00:09:59,882
