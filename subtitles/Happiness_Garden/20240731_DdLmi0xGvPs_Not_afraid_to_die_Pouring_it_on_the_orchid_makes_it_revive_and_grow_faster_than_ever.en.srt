Welcome to my channel Happiness Garden.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,899
In this video, I will share 3 methods to help you care for and restore orchids quickly 

3
00:00:08,899 --> 00:00:12,898
and bloom all year round.

4
00:00:12,898 --> 00:00:18,897
Now let's start learning about the uses of the first type of fertilizer.

5
00:00:19,897 --> 00:00:28,895
Take 3 liters of water at room temperature.

6
00:00:50,057 --> 00:00:58,214
Take 50ml of Coca-Cola.

7
00:00:59,363 --> 00:01:13,878
Then you just need to mix coca-cola with water and you can use it right away.

8
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:32,016
Then you clean the surface of the orchid leaves with this coca-cola.

9
00:01:48,984 --> 00:02:02,249
Wipe both the top and bottom of the leaves.

10
00:02:10,684 --> 00:02:25,051
This way helps to repel insects and fungi on leaves very well.

11
00:02:32,582 --> 00:02:45,293
Do it once every 2 weeks, orchid leaves will be very well protected.

12
00:03:21,894 --> 00:03:41,721
You can also use this water to spray the entire orchid.

13
00:03:52,765 --> 00:04:04,752
Pay attention to spray carefully the underside of leaves and between leaves.

14
00:04:05,026 --> 00:04:15,017
because insects and fungi often congregate there.

15
00:04:16,686 --> 00:04:26,681
This is also done every 2 weeks.

16
00:04:29,094 --> 00:04:39,079
if you use the wiping and spraying method of coca-cola regularly,

17
00:04:40,078 --> 00:04:51,268
Leaves will always be green because they are not damaged by insects and fungi.

18
00:04:52,771 --> 00:05:01,463
Like my orchid, the leaves are always green and healthy.

19
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:21,870
Now take care of the roots.

20
00:05:21,937 --> 00:05:31,280
You just need to water this orchid as much as possible.

21
00:05:33,475 --> 00:05:45,991
Coca-Cola contains phosphoric acid which has a mild bleaching effect.

22
00:05:46,965 --> 00:05:57,624
so it will eliminate fungal diseases in pots and roots very well.

23
00:06:00,047 --> 00:06:12,027
In addition, Coca-Cola also has the ability to kill some insects that damage plant roots such as:

24
00:06:12,027 --> 00:06:18,111
snails and cockroaches are very good.

25
00:06:21,886 --> 00:06:31,523
Coca-Cola helps neutralize the acid in the pot when you use too much chemical fertilizer.

26
00:06:34,075 --> 00:06:42,332
balance pH in orchid pots.

27
00:06:43,956 --> 00:06:53,864
This will stimulate new root growth.

28
00:06:56,622 --> 00:07:05,314
Coca-Cola contains sugar that helps flowers grow very well.

29
00:07:06,584 --> 00:07:16,232
If combined with organic fertilizers, it will help spread more flowers.

30
00:07:21,886 --> 00:07:31,794
My orchids when applying this method have grown a lot of flower branches on one tree.

31
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:10,361
The sugar in coca-cola helps flowers stay fresh and long-lasting.

32
00:08:11,732 --> 00:08:21,701
Orchid after blooming will not be exhausted.

33
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:34,332
Orchid can bloom continuously from one batch to another.

34
00:08:48,258 --> 00:08:56,776
New roots are always growing.

35
00:08:59,663 --> 00:09:10,006
Helps orchids absorb the most nutrients.

36
00:09:20,423 --> 00:09:28,888
Hope the video will help you in taking care of orchids at home better.

37
00:09:29,021 --> 00:09:34,287

And don't rush to leave the screen. Tip #2 and tip #3 will be even better.

41
00:10:04,214 --> 00:10:13,879
If you have an orchid that has rot causing the leaves to turn yellow.

42
00:10:16,878 --> 00:10:26,876
So don't rush to throw it away. I will share how to revive it quickly and easily.

43
00:10:37,874 --> 00:10:48,872
This orchid may be suffering from inorganic fertilizer shock leading to root rot causing the leaves to turn yellow.

44
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:06,868
So I need to check the roots to cut off all damaged roots.

45
00:11:26,898 --> 00:11:36,896
Removing damaged roots helps prevent the rot from spreading, causing the entire root of the orchid to rot.

46
00:11:44,894 --> 00:11:54,892
and stimulates new root formation faster.

47
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:12,888
Then rinse with water.

48
00:12:42,883 --> 00:12:52,881
Take 2 liters of water and put it in a jar.

49
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:12,877
Then add 1 teaspoon of Baking Soda to help kill bacteria and eliminate pests.

50
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:36,872
Soak orchid roots in this water for 10 minutes.

51
00:13:56,868 --> 00:14:06,899
Then use dry moss to grow orchids.

52
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:19,897
After soaking for 10 minutes, take the orchid out and plant it.

53
00:14:26,895 --> 00:14:36,893
When planting dry, sterilized moss, it will help absorb moisture from the roots.

54
00:14:36,893 --> 00:14:46,891
This helps the cut heal quickly and the rot does not spread further.

55
00:14:51,890 --> 00:15:01,888
Then place in a cool place and do not water for 1 week.

56
00:15:08,854 --> 00:15:16,885
After 1 week, start watering the orchid once a week.

57
00:15:36,881 --> 00:15:44,880
Soak in water for 10 minutes to keep the moss moist.

58
00:15:50,879 --> 00:16:00,877
Then take it out and cover it with a transparent plastic box.

59
00:16:11,874 --> 00:16:21,872
And remember to water it every week to keep it moist.

60
00:16:30,871 --> 00:16:36,869
1 MONTH LATER.

61
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:51,900
The orchid has revived and grown healthy roots.

62
00:17:04,897 --> 00:17:15,895
But it seems like the leaves are a bit wilted.

63
00:17:20,894 --> 00:17:30,892
Once the root system is strong, you need to add more nutrients to help the orchid grow quickly.

64
00:17:35,891 --> 00:17:42,890
Take 2 liters of water.

65
00:17:52,888 --> 00:18:02,886
and add 5 teaspoons of rice.

66
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:17,883
Rice contains a variety of minerals and amino acids that are important for orchid growth.

67
00:18:41,878 --> 00:18:51,876
Then use this rice water to water the orchids once a week.

68
00:19:03,874 --> 00:19:12,872
In addition to providing necessary nutrients,

69
00:19:12,872 --> 00:19:22,870
 rice water also creates a favorable environment for beneficial microorganisms to grow in orchid pots.

70
00:19:25,869 --> 00:19:33,868
Soak for 10 minutes then take out the orchid pot.

71
00:19:55,864 --> 00:20:02,895
Regularly spray mist to keep the soil moist when the growing medium is dry.

72
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:35,889
2 MONTHS LATER.

73
00:20:48,886 --> 00:20:58,884
From an orchid with leaf rot causing the leaves to turn completely yellow, it has now grown healthily.

74
00:21:02,883 --> 00:21:12,881
Strong roots, fresh green leaves.

75
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:36,877

Welcome to tip number 3.

80
00:22:06,838 --> 00:22:13,870
To help you have many choices when caring for orchids at home with organic fertilizer.

81
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:20,868
In this video, I continue to share new methods.

Subscribe to the video so you don't miss any tips on my channel.

83
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,899
Now, let's get started.

84
00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:46,896
To make this type of organic fertilizer you need black tea (or tea grounds).

85
00:22:50,896 --> 00:22:59,894
I use 3 teaspoons of black tea.

86
00:23:01,893 --> 00:23:11,891
Add 1 liter of boiled water.

87
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:31,888
Incubate until the water cools.

88
00:23:38,886 --> 00:24:08,880
After the water cools, filter to remove sediment.

89
00:24:18,878 --> 00:24:28,876
Add water to make 5 liters of black tea solution.

90
00:24:41,874 --> 00:24:56,871
Next add 1 teaspoon of baking soda.

91
00:25:11,868 --> 00:25:15,900
FIRST METHOD

92
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:28,898
Water this fertilizer solution on the orchid roots.

93
00:25:36,896 --> 00:25:46,894
Black tea contains many minerals and organic substances that help provide nutrition for orchids.

94
00:25:55,892 --> 00:26:05,890
It contains nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus,

95
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:15,888
Important nutritional factors for orchid growth.

96
00:26:26,886 --> 00:26:36,884
Baking soda (bicarbonate soda) has the ability to increase the PH level in orchid pots,

97
00:26:40,883 --> 00:26:50,881
This is helpful in reducing acidity if you use too much chemical fertilizer.

98
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:09,878
Baking soda has the ability to kill insects and fungi that are harmful to plants.

99
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:26,874
SECOND METHOD

100
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:56,868
Spray this fertilizer on the entire orchid.

101
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:16,898
This method is similar to using foliar fertilizer.

102
00:28:23,896 --> 00:28:33,894
You can use it as a natural pesticide to protect orchids from insects and diseases.

103
00:29:01,889 --> 00:29:05,888
THIRD METHOD

104
00:29:12,887 --> 00:29:22,885
Clean the leaf surface with this fertilizer solution.

105
00:29:33,882 --> 00:29:45,880
The leaf surface will always be clean and the stomata will not be clogged.

106
00:29:55,878 --> 00:30:05,876
Orchids will photosynthesize better.

107
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:14,874
RESULT

108
00:30:19,873 --> 00:30:33,871
Plant roots are protected and supplemented with nutrients so they grow very healthily.

109
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:48,868
will help orchids absorb the most nutrients.

110
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:05,898
Because they are provided with enough nutrition, the flowers bloom more brilliantly.

111
00:31:09,897 --> 00:31:19,895
Many flowers bloom on the same branch.

112
00:31:26,893 --> 00:31:37,891
The flowers stay on the branches for a long time before fading.

113
00:31:55,888 --> 00:32:02,887
Thank you for watching the video. Wishing you luck and success in life.

114
00:32:05,886 --> 00:32:15,884
Goodbye and see you again in the next videos.
