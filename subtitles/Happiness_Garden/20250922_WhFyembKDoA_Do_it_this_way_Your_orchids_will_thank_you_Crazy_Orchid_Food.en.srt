00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,199
blooms.

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,000
These are the stems after the flowers

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,079
have dropped their petals, but they are

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,879
still full of potential to keep growing

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,879
if cared for properly.

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,200
I cut off all the dry stems so the plant

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,000
doesn't waste energy, allowing nutrients

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,000
to focus on the green parts, helping the

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,559
orchid recover quickly and get ready to

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,559
grow new shoots.

[Music]

26
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,560
After that, I sprinkle a thin layer of

27
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,280
cinnamon powder on the cut to disinfect

28
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,680
it and help it heal quickly, protecting

29
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,000
the plant from fungus and supporting

30
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,000
better recovery.

31
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,360
After that, I let the plant rest for a

32
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,600
day without watering, giving the cut

33
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,960
time to dry and heal completely before

34
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,960
moving on to the next stage of care.

35
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,080
I take a fresh aloe vera leaf and slice

36
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,480
it into thin pieces so that when used,

37
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,319
the nutrients in the aloe can easily

38
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,720
absorb into the orchid stem and nourish

39
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,720
the plant better.

[Music]

41
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,560
Then I gently apply the aloe vera gel to

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,480
the spent flower stems. This helps the

43
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,959
stems recover quickly, stimulates new

44
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,200
shoots to grow, and prepares for the

45
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,200
next blooms.

It's wonderful that we can connect and

chat from all around the world.

51
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,720
And uh I also continue applying aloe

52
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,959
vera gel to the leaves once a week. This

53
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,959
not only helps eliminate pathogens but

54
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,360
also allows wilted orchids to recover

55
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:21,319
quickly, making the leaves turn glossy

56
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,319
green and full of life.

[Music]

58
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,239
I put the sliced aloe vera into a clean

59
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,159
jar. Then add 2 L of boiled water to

60
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,400
extract all the natural nutrients from

61
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,400
the aloe.

00:03:50,460 --> 00:04:02,959
[Music]

63
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,120
Um, add a spoonful of rice to the jar.

64
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,519
Rice is rich in natural vitamins and

65
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,080
minerals, especially vitamin B1, which

66
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,080
helps stimulate strong root growth, keep

67
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,959
the leaves lush green, and speed up the

68
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,519
orchid's recovery. Then, I add three

69
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,840
crushed eggshells to the mixture.

70
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,519
Eggshells provide natural calcium,

71
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,199
helping the stems and leaves become

72
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,680
stronger and increasing the orchid's

73
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,160
resistance, reducing root rot and

74
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,240
yellowing leaves.

75
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,919
I close the lid and wait for the water

76
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,759
to cool completely, allowing the

77
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,560
nutrients from the aloe, rice, and

78
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:41,800
eggshells to fully dissolve, creating a

79
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,800
nutrient-rich solution for the orchids.

80
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,880
After the water has cooled, I stir well

81
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,199
to fully dissolve the nutrients. Then

82
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:59,140
strain out the residue, leaving a clear

83
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:17,210
solution ready to water the orchids.

84
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:17,210
[Music]

85
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,600
I water the orchids with this solution

86
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,600
two to three times a month. This helps

87
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,160
provide complete nutrition, allowing the

88
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,919
plant to recover quickly, grow strong

89
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,919
roots, and regain lush green leaves.

90
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,639
I soak the whole orchid pot in this

91
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,880
solution for about 20 minutes so the

92
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,039
roots can fully absorb the nutrients.

93
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,360
Then take it out and place it in a spot

94
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:51,639
with gentle sunlight to let it dry and

95
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,639
continue photosynthesizing well.

[Music]

97
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,800
The second method, you can pour this

98
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,639
mixture into a spray bottle and mist it

99
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,199
directly on the leaves, roots, and

100
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,280
growing medium. This method helps the

101
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,319
plant absorb nutrients faster, makes the

102
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,450
leaves shiny green, and promotes even

103
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,680
root growth.

105
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,560
Be sure to spray thoroughly on both the

106
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,639
top and underside of the leaves as well

107
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,720
as the growing medium so the plant can

108
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:41,919
fully absorb the nutrients.

[Music]

110
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,759
Do this regularly two to three times a

111
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,000
month and you will see your orchid

112
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:52,360
become healthier with lush green leaves

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,360
and rapidly growing roots.

114
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,080
This method also effectively eliminates

115
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,759
harmful fungi and bacteria, keeping the

116
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,039
plant clean and healthy while reducing

117
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,039
root rot and yellowing leaves.

118
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,599
Uh after soaking for about 20 minutes,

119
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,080
remember to take the orchid pot out and

120
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,319
place it in a spot with gentle sunlight,

121
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,319
allowing the roots to dry naturally and

122
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,180
the plant to continue photosynthesizing

123
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:28,720
for faster recovery.

130
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,360
This method helps the new shoots grow

131

very quickly. After just one month, many

132
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,440
