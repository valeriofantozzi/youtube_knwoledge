Hello orchid enthusiasts.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,839
Today I'm excited to share with you how

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,920
to make homemade organic fertilizer that

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,920
helps orchids thrive from their roots,

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:16,080

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,240
This fertilizer not only provides

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,480
essential nutrients but also protects

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,480

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,279
Let's get started.

11
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,559
To fertilize orchids, I use green tea.

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,399
Green tea is not only rich in

13
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,840
antioxidants, but also provides

14
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,000
essential nutrients for plants.

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,079
Amino acids and minerals in green tea

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,260
help plants grow strongly, increase

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:58,879
resistance, and enhance leaf color.

soil structure and effectively retains

21
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,719

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,119
