welcome to my channel!

2
00:00:05,865 --> 00:00:12,898
If you have an orchid with yellow leaves and weak roots, don't miss this video

3
00:00:17,422 --> 00:00:23,896
First, remove all yellow leaves and damaged roots

4
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:47,958
Tell me where you come from

5
00:00:48,957 --> 00:00:56,956
Let me create subtitles for your country's language so we can communicate easily

6
00:01:11,442 --> 00:01:18,885
Then use small pieces of pine bark to replant this orchid.

8
00:02:05,414 --> 00:02:12,874
Spread a layer of moss on the surface of the orchid pot to help retain moisture better

9
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:36,669
Take 2 tablespoons of vinegar.

10
00:02:54,179 --> 00:03:00,898
Mix 4 liters of water with the vinegar.

11
00:03:22,988 --> 00:03:30,959
Step 1: Clean orchid leaves with this water

12
00:03:33,704 --> 00:03:40,890
Vinegar water helps remove lime deposits and dirt from the leaves, 

13
00:03:43,663 --> 00:03:50,888
allowing them to photosynthesize better under sunlight.

14
00:03:54,562 --> 00:04:02,886
At the same time, it eliminates harmful insects that often hide on the underside of leaves, 

15
00:04:05,961 --> 00:04:12,884
such as red spiders, leafhoppers, aphids, and thrips.

16
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:32,880
If you don't understand, don't hesitate to comment so we can help you

17
00:04:53,320 --> 00:05:00,874
Doing this 1–2 times a month will keep orchid leaves green and prevent leaf diseases.

18
00:05:11,859 --> 00:05:20,870
Then take 1 teaspoon of sugar and mix it with the vinegar water.

19
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:50,898
Step 2: Water this water on the orchid roots.

20
00:05:56,628 --> 00:06:04,895
Vinegar combined with sugar helps stimulate root growth very quickly and effectively.

21
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:14,963
Vinegar helps eliminate pests harmful to orchid roots, while sugar provides nutrients 

22
00:06:14,963 --> 00:06:23,748
and creates an environment for beneficial microorganisms to thrive around the roots.

23
00:06:27,326 --> 00:06:33,889
Soak in this water for 30 minutes.

24
00:06:40,812 --> 00:06:48,886
Then take it out and place it in a spot with gentle sunlight so the orchid can photosynthesize and grow well.

25
00:06:54,596 --> 00:07:01,884
Use the remaining mixture to water other healthy orchids to promote their growth 

26
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,981
and improve their resistance to pests and diseases.

27
00:07:21,183 --> 00:07:29,878
Use this solution on your orchids twice a month.

28
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,873
1 MONTH LATER

29
00:08:02,165 --> 00:08:09,870
After only 1 month, the orchid has developed many new roots

30
00:08:18,557 --> 00:08:26,900
These new roots will absorb the best water and nutrients, helping the orchid grow quickly

31
00:08:38,528 --> 00:08:46,896
Hopefully the video content will help you how to care for orchids at home

32
00:08:51,435 --> 00:08:58,894
Thank you for watching! Wishing you good health and good luck in taking care of your orchids at home.

33
00:09:00,894 --> 00:09:03,893
Welcome to part 2 of this video

34
00:09:29,621 --> 00:09:36,886
Rice is a common and very effective organic fertilizer for plants.

35
00:09:36,886 --> 00:09:45,885
So in this video, I will show you 2 methods to make orchid fertilizer using rice.

36
00:09:46,884 --> 00:09:48,884
FIRST WAY

37
00:09:50,884 --> 00:10:02,881
ake 3 tablespoons of rice.

38
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:20,878
Grind it into a fine powder..

39
00:10:38,874 --> 00:10:52,871
Add 1 liter of boiling water.

40
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:15,900
Close the lid and wait for it to cool.

41
00:11:43,895 --> 00:11:49,893
filter out residue.

42
00:11:53,893 --> 00:11:59,891
Dilute it with 2 liters of water.

43
00:12:01,891 --> 00:12:05,890
Now use this water to water the orchid

44
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:15,888
Rice contains many nutrients such as potassium, fosfor, and protein, which are essential nutrients for the growth of orchids.

45
00:12:16,888 --> 00:12:26,886
Therefore, rice washing water helps the plants grow healthily and enhances their resistance to pests and diseases.

46
00:12:29,886 --> 00:12:37,884
Rice washing water helps boost the activity of beneficial microorganisms in the orchid's growing medium, 

47
00:12:37,884 --> 00:12:45,882
thereby protecting the roots and making it easier for them to absorb nutrients.

48
00:12:47,882 --> 00:12:55,880
Doing this once a month will help your orchids grow strong and healthy.

49
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:13,877
And of course, it will also bloom a lot.

50
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:20,875
The microflora in the orchid growing medium helps to protect the roots from rot

51
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:26,874
When the roots grow, they absorb nutrients that make the flowers more beautiful, 

52
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:32,873
so the flowers stay in bloom for a long time before their petals wither.

53
00:13:37,872 --> 00:13:47,870
Regular care in this way will ensure the leaves receive enough nutrients, allowing them to grow very green.

54
00:14:22,897 --> 00:14:24,896
SECOND WAY.

55
00:14:25,896 --> 00:14:35,894
When cooking rice, we usually rinse the rice. From now on, don't rush to pour this rice water down the drain.

56
00:14:36,894 --> 00:14:46,892
Filter this rice washing water and let it settle.

57
00:14:48,891 --> 00:14:51,891
wait for it to settle down

58
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:11,887
After it has settled, filter 100ml of the water from the top.

59
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:16,886
Dilute it with 200ml of regular water.

60
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:31,883
Put this rice water in a spray bottle

61
00:15:34,882 --> 00:15:42,881
Use this water to spray evenly on the surface of the orchid leaves

62
00:15:42,881 --> 00:15:57,878
Vitamin B1 in rice water helps stimulate the conversion of nutrients, especially harmful substances such as manganese, iron and copper into a more easily absorbed form.

63
00:15:57,878 --> 00:16:05,876
Vitamin B1 helps strengthen the orchid's immune system, 

64
00:16:06,876 --> 00:16:14,874
allowing the plant to fight off pests and other environmental stressors.

65
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:25,872
For the rice water that has settled at the bottom, I filter out the residue.

66
00:16:27,872 --> 00:16:34,870
then add 2 liters of water

67
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:43,869
And I use this water to water my orchids

68
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:55,900
we also do this once a month like the first way i shared at the beginning of the video

69
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:02,898
Additionally, you can combine other organic fertilizers to ensure your orchids receive all the necessary nutrients.

70
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:08,897
Thank you for watching the video. Wishing you all the best of luck and success.
