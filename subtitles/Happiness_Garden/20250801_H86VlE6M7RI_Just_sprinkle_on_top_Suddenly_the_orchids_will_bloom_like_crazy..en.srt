Welcome to the happiness garden. Today I

00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,640
will continue to share with you a new

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,519
natural fertilizer method that is simple

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,200
but effective. I hope this recipe will

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,840
give you more options to take care of

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:18,839
your orchid pots so they stay healthy

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,839
and always bloom beautifully at home.

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,320
When you have a small orchid from a

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,160
nursery pot or are about to repot a

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,720
mature orchid, the first step is to

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,359
check the growing medium. If the medium

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,280
is too old, decomposed, or retains

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,360
moisture poorly, you should remove it

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,360
completely. But if the medium is still

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,640
good, we just need to treat it for

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,960
reuse. For this young orchid, the medium

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,480
is still in good condition. So, I will

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,480
treat and keep the old medium.

Um to treat the old growing medium,

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,560
prepare about one liter of clean water

the prepared 1 L of water. Baking soda

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,960

27
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,240
sterilizes the growing medium while

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,920
remaining safe for the roots. Stir well

29
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,440

After preparing the baking soda

40
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,200
into it. For a small orchid, dipping for

41
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,119
about 10 to 20 seconds is enough. For a

42
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,880
mature orchid, you can soak the leaves

43
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,640

the new growing medium before placing

58

59
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,400
important to eliminate potential fungal

well ventilated area to drain. The

71
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,200
surface of the medium should be dry, but

72
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,879
it should still retain internal moisture

73
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:40,440
to help prevent the orchid from going

74
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,440
into shock when planted in the new pot.

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,519
While waiting for the growing medium to

76
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:52,120
drain, uh, gently take the orchid out to

prepare for repotting into the new pot.

78
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,920
When planting orchids, you should choose

79
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,319
a pot with drainage holes at the bottom.

80
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,720
This is very important to prevent water

83
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,760
First, place a few pieces of foam at the

84
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,280
bottom of the pot to improve drainage

85
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,000
and prevent the growing medium from

86
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,320
becoming compacted. Then, add a thin

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,519
layer of the medium on top to prepare

88
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,519

the medium settle into the gaps around

100
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,600
the roots. This helps the plant stay

101

102
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,300

retain moisture on the pot's surface and

109
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,650
creates a stable environment for the

Put the rice in a pan and toast it over

low heat. Stir evenly until the rice

126

them easier for the plant to absorb.

130
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,720
Toasted rice differs from regular rice

131
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,280
in that after toasting, the nutrients in

134
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,000

192
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,720
You can also soak the orchid pot in this

193
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,480
mixture for about 20 minutes. This

194
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,480
method allows the roots to absorb

195
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,720
nutrients more deeply while also

196
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,680
soothing the plant after repotting or

197

during its recovery period.

198
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,959
The leftover solution can be poured into

199
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,530

200
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:46,720

[Music]

202
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,680
Then lightly spray it on the leaves and

203
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,160
roots of other orchids in the garden to

204
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,080
help them absorb nutrients better while

205
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,880
also maintaining moisture and boosting

206
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,880
their natural resistance.

207
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Spraying the toasted rice mixture will

208
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,240
provide a gentle amount of nutrients to

209
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,800
the orchid. As a result, the leaves

210
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,040
become greener, the roots grow stronger,

211
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,600
and the plant recovers more easily after

212
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,600
periods of stress.

213
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,279
In addition, the thin mist from the

214
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,959
solution helps retain moisture on the

215
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,200
surface of the leaves. This is

216
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,200
especially useful during dry weather or

217
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,950

218
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,129

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,920
the right amount of nutrients, avoiding

223

place it in a spot with soft sunlight.

236
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,920

237

patience and a little love, your orchid

238
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,100

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:42,320

243
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,920
cling to the new growing medium. This is

244
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,920
a positive sign that the plant is

245
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,370
gradually adapting and thriving in its

246
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:04,079

orchid twice a month regularly and

250
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,800

252
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,600
grow steadily from roots to leaves. With

253
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,830

strong root growth and enhances nutrient

absorption. When the root system is

260
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,279
healthy, the orchid will quickly

261
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:54,079
stabilize in the new growing medium and

262
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,760

263
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,440
vital foundation for the plant to

264
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,920
continue growing and prepare for the
