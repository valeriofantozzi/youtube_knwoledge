Welcome to the happiness garden, where

00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:07,759
leaves whisper, flowers bloom, and love

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,280
for nature fills every moment.

00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,000
Healthy roots nourish the plant from

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,719
within. Green leaves absorb sunlight to

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,640
sustain the stem. And flowers are the

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,800
vibrant gift that nature offers in

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,880
return for your persistent care.

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,359
This is an orchid with rotting leaves

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,720
caused by a fungal attack. A sign that

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:31,119
the plant is silently crying for help.

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,880
The first thing we need to do is gently

13
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,960
separate the infected orchid from the

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,399
healthy ones to prevent the spread and

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,399
give the whole garden a chance to

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,399
recover.

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,120
Now, I will share with you how to revive

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,600
an orchid that has rotted and is left

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,160
with only a single leaf. It may seem

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,120
fragile, but with proper care, life can

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,120
still begin again from here.

[Music]

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,239
After carefully checking the root

24
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,720
system, we need to boldly cut off all

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,960
the damaged roots because only by

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,799
removing the decayed parts can the plant

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,360
have a chance to regenerate and grow

28
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,360
from what is healthy.

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,360
Continue to thoroughly cut away the

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,600
rotting parts of the orchid stem. This

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,840
helps eliminate any remaining sources of

32
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,600
disease and creates the conditions for

33
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,050
the plant to recover in a clean, safe

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:54,560
environment.

Don't forget to cut off the old flower

38
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,680
worn out parts, the plant will focus all

39
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,780
its energy on renewing its vitality from

40
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,599

After pruning, rinse the entire orchid

43
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,400
with water. A simple but important step

44
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,680
to remove any remaining pathogens and

45
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,160

56
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,400
After rinsing, place the plant in a dry,

57
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,040
wellventilated area to allow it to dry

58
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,200
completely.

59
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,280
To revive this orchid today, I will use

60
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,599
turmeric powder, uh, a natural

61
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,760
ingredient with strong antibacterial

62
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,000
properties that helps protect the cut

63
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,570
areas and supports the plant's recovery

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,159
gently yet effectively.

[Music]

66
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:21,720
Add 3 tesp of turmeric powder into a

67
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,720
clean cup.

68
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,640
Then add 500 ml of water. Stir well

69
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,640
until the turmeric powder is completely

70
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,879
dissolved, creating a natural solution

71
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,360
that helps disinfect and stimulates the

72
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,360
orchid's recovery.

73
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,040
After stirring well, cover the cup and

74
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,840
let the turmeric solution soak for about

75
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,440
10 minutes. This step allows the active

76
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,599
compounds in the turmeric to fully

77
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:01,640
infuse into the water, making it ready

78
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,640
to use for plant care.

79
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,840
After 10 minutes, stir the mixture again

80
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,720
and then strain out the residue. This

81
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,640
will give you a clearer, pure turmeric

82
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,120
solution that the plant can absorb more

83
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,920
easily and that won't clog the soft

84
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,920
tissues at the cut areas.

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,919
especially beneficial for new root

89
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,000
development. It's vitamin B1. This

90
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,919
vitamin helps stimulate the growth of

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,360
strong roots and boosts the plant's

92
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,360
ability to recover after damage.

93
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,560
Add two tablets of 2.5 mg vitamin B1

94

into the solution. Just the right amount

95
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,840
to help the plant absorb quickly,

96
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,800
stimulate young root growth, and

97
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,800
naturally restore its vitality.

104
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,630

110

carefully. With just a bit of attention

192
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,160
to detail, you'll be able to create the

193
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,420
ideal environment for your orchid to

194
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:33,120
quickly sprout new roots.

[Music]

196
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,680
Place a piece of cotton here to help

197
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,680
absorb water and retain moisture more

198
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,680
effectively.

200
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,800
Then gently place the orchid roots on

201
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,120
top of the prepared cotton and put

202
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,040
everything into a transparent pot. This

203
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,200
method gently keeps the roots moist

204
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:21,639
while allowing you to easily observe the

205
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,639
plant's development each day.

[Music]

207
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,959
Next, pour filtered water into the pot,

208
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,959
but make sure it doesn't touch the roots

209
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,600
directly. It's enough for the water to

210
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,279
moisten the cotton underneath.

211
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,880
This gentle level of moisture will

212
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,070
stimulate new root growth without

213
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:44,639
causing rot or damage to the base.

[Music]

215
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,720
Each day, simply mist the orchid leaves

216
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,760
lightly with clean water once to

217
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,160
maintain humidity. This keeps the leaves

218
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,000
from drying out, preserves freshness,

219
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,399
and supports the plant's recovery in the

220
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,399
rooting environment.

221
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,480
And here is the result after 50 days of

222
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,480
recovery.

[Music]

224
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,959
You can see that many new healthy roots

225
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,959
have grown.

227
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,720
Even more remarkably, from the orchid

228
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,040
stem that had lost its tip and was left

229
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,720
with only a single weak leaf, two new

230
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,360
baby plants have now emerged from the

231
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,519
remaining old stem. A beautiful

232
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,680
testament to the incredible resilience

233
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,680
of orchids.

234
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,480
The orchid's only remaining old leaf has

235
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:55,279
also transformed, becoming noticeably

236
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,360
greener and stronger. With proper care,

237
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,440
the leaf not only continues to sustain

238
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,959
the plant, but also serves as a solid

239
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,279
foundation for the orchid to keep

240
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,279
growing vigorously.

241
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,680
And now with the plant fully recovered,

242
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,720
we'll repot the orchid into a new pot

243
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,959
with a completely fresh growing medium.

244
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,199
This provides a clean, nutrient-rich

245
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,279
environment that supports continued root

246
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:25,399
and leaf development and prepares the

247
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,399
plant for its next blooming season.

[Music]

249
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,720
I chose to use a transparent pot and a

250
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,120
growing medium of pine bark chips that

251
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,279
have been treated to remove any fungi.

252
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,440
The clear pot allows easy observation of

253
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,519
root development, while the pine bark

254
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,760
provides good air flow, retains moisture

255
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:53,399
well, and creates a safe environment for

256
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,399
healthy root growth.
