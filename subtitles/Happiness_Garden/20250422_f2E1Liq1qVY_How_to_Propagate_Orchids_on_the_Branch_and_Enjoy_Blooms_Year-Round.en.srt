Hello and welcome back to the channel.

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,960
In today's video, I'm going to share

9
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,920
with you a simple yet fascinating method

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,920
to propagate orchids. Stem cutting.

11
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,600
When the last orchid blooms fall, that's

12
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,440
the perfect time to start propagating

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,440
orchids using the stem cutting

14
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,920
method. With just a few easy steps and a

15
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,000
bit of patience, you can create new

16
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,780
orchid plants from the very stems you

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,240
already have at

18
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:13,520
[Music]

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,280
home. When all the nutrients in the

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,119
orchid plant are focused on blooming,

21
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,200
the leaves at the base will suffer from

22
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,360
a lack of nutrients leading to

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,920
yellowing.

24
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,200
Therefore, cutting the stem for

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,360
propagation uh not only helps with

26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,360
reproduction, but also aids the orchid

27
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,560
in recovering after blooming, allowing

28
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,560
the plant to continue growing

29
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,320
healthier. I will cut across here to

30
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,320
make a cutting.

31
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,960
The buds that haven't bloomed yet

32
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,479
actually contain dormant shoots. So, we

33
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,439
should keep these buds when propagating

34
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,799
orchids through stem

35
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,640
cutings. These dormant buds will help

36
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,640
the orchid grow stronger after being

37
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,200
propagated, opening up the possibility

38
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,200
for future

39
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,119
blooms. As for the buds that have

40
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,799
already bloomed, we will cut them off

41
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,240
because they no longer contain dormant

42
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,360
shoots.

[Music]

44
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,720
Removing these buds helps the plant

45
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,400
focus its nutrients on the parts that

46
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,400
are capable of growing and propagating

47
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,400
better.

[Music]

50
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,480
At the base of the cutting, I will make

51
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,480
a diagonal cut to increase the surface

52
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,080
area, helping the cutting absorb water

53
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,080
and nutrients more easily when

54
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,120
propagating. At the tip of the cutting,

55
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,599
I will make a horizontal cut to reduce

56
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,239
the cut surface area, helping the wound

57
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,760
heal quickly and minimizing water loss.

58
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,680
This method helps the plant recover

59
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,220
better and focus its nutrients on root

60
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:09,029

67
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,640
In addition to English dubbing, we have

68
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,120
now created French, German, Italian,

73
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,879
we have created subtitles so you can

74
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,879
read and understand the content.

75
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,439
Then we will peel off the protective

76
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,280
layer around the dormant bud, allowing

77
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,560
it to develop into a new chute more

78
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,560
easily and quickly when

79
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,040
stimulated. This step helps the orchid's

80
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,040
growth process become more efficient and

81
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,040

antibacterial protection but also

91
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,759
provides moisture and natural nutrients

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,759
It helps stimulate faster root growth

99
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,520

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,080
while also offering antibacterial

101
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,680
protection, good moisture retention, and

102
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,639
a variety of vitamins that support

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,639
quicker recovery of the

104
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,639
cutting. Insert the slanted cut end of

105
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,479
the cutting into the aloe vera gel. This

106
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,639
allows the cut to directly absorb the

107
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,400
nutrients and hormones in the gel,

108
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,380
stimulating faster root growth and

109
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,569

cycle. Then place the aloe vera in one

122
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,560
liter of water and wait for about 30

123
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,919
minutes for the nutrients from the aloe

124
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,919
vera to dissolve into the water.

125
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,360
At that point, you'll have a natural,

126
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,199
nutrient-rich solution to water your

127
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,440
orchid, helping the plant recover and

128
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,440

130
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:28,240
better. Next, we need to use baking

131
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,840
soda. Baking soda helps adjust the pH

132
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,360
level in the orchid's growing medium,

133
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,560
creating an ideal environment for the

134
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,560
orchid to thrive.

135
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,919
Take one teaspoon of baking soda. Put it

136
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,919
in a cup. Dilute it with one liter of

137
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,759
water. Dissolve the baking soda in the

138
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,000
water to create a solution that helps

139
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,319
adjust the pH and supports the orchid's

140
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,319
better growth.

146
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:20,039
for the nutrients from the baking soda

147
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,039
to completely dissolve into the water.

148
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,520
for the cutting. After placing it in the

149
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,159
aloe vera gel, you should also wait for

150
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,159
about 30

151
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:38,800
minutes. This time allows the cutting to

152
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,640
absorb nutrients from the aloe vera gel,

153
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,640
providing the best conditions for root

discussed

158
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,800
earlier. Changing the growing medium

159
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,880
provides a fresh environment for the

160
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,600
roots to grow healthy and absorb

161
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,600
nutrients more

[Music]

163
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,399
effectively. Over time, the old growing

164
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,320
medium can break down, reducing drainage

165
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,040
capacity and making it difficult for the

166
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,040
roots to access

167
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,720
oxygen. Um, not only that, but that the

168
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,480
pH level of the medium can also change

169
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,200
over time, becoming unsuitable for the

170
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,200
orchid's growth needs.

171
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,839
Therefore, we need to either replace the

172
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,060
growing medium or treat it to ensure a

173
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:50,240

This soaking time allows the roots to

214
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:57,240
absorb nutrients from the aloe vera,

215
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,240
promoting better growth and recovery.

216
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,399
Then use a soft cloth to absorb the aloe

water to keep the cutting

260
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:31,840
moist. From now on, you need to

261
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,000
regularly monitor the growing medium. If

262
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,240
it appears dry, spray water immediately

263
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,360

356
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,720

360
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,400
I plant the orchid using pine bark chips

361
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,559
because they provide excellent drainage,

362
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,360
