Welcome to the happiness garden where we

00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,520
explore the wonderful beauty of orchids

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,960
together and learn how to care for them

Today I will continue to share with you

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,680
a new method for uh making natural

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,760
fertilizer that is both simple and

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,240
effective, suitable for orchids and many

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,160
other types of plants using familiar

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,960
ingredients that almost every household

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,960
already has in the kitchen.

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,960
This type of fertilizer will help your

14
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,880
orchid grow quickly, stay healthy, and

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,440
remain vibrant with beautiful clusters

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,600
of flowers that bloom evenly and last a

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,600
long time.

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,280
The flowers will stay fresh longer right

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,960
on the plant and may even bloom year

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,690

Let's get started.

24
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,840
To make today's natural fertilizer, I

25
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,080
will use eggshells. A simple, easy to

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,320
find ingredient that is very rich in

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,240
essential nutrients for plants, helping

28
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,990
to strengthen the health of orchids and

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,160
other plants in the garden.

[Applause]

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,040
Take about 10 eggshells and wash them

32
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,200
thoroughly with water to remove all dirt

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,320

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,000
Next, use a mortar and pestle to crush

61
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,879
the eggshells into small pieces, making

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,319
the fertilizer easier to dissolve and

63
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,550
allowing the plants to absorb the

64
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,749

eggshells into a clean glass jar for

70
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,360
fermentation, helping the nutrients from

the eggshells blend and work best when

72
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,920
applied to the plants.

74
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,200
Then pour about 100 mm of white vinegar

75
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,120
into the jar to help dissolve the

76
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,680
minerals in the crushed eggshells and

77
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,680
stimulate the decomposition process,

78
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,480
creating a natural fertilizer rich in

79
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,480
nutrients for the plants.

and the vinegar.

When you see bubbling and foam appear,

84
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,479
that is a sign that the the minerals are

85
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,220
dissolving and breaking down, ready to

After fermenting overnight, prepare some

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,880
clean water to dilute the fertilizer

96
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,120
before use. This helps reduce the

97
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,919
acidity and ensures it's safe for the

98
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,919
plant roots when watering.

99
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,320
Prepare two cups, each containing one

100
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,320

and white vinegar solution into each

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,320

105
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,160
the right amount of nutrients for the

106
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,160

Then I proceed to treat the pine bark

before planting to eliminate fungi and

112
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,600
impurities while also making the bark

113
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,930
safer and more suitable as a growing

114
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:58,000

Pour the diluted fertilizer mixture over

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,560
the pine bark and moss to soak them for

118
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,880
about 20 minutes before planting. This

119
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,560
helps with light sterilization, adds

120
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,800
initial nutrients, and softens the

121
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,800

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,800

124
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,420
Now I prepare a healthy small orchid to

125
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:36,499
repot into a new pot.

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,960
You need to remove the old moss or

orchid growing foam before planting

129
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,840
because these mediums retain water very

130
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,840
well, but can easily cause root rot when

131
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,880
transferring to a larger pot, negatively

132
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,880

After removing the old growing medium,

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,280
we need to cut off any rotten and weak

roots.

137
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,479
This helps remove parts that can no

138
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,080
longer absorb nutrients while also

139
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,800
stimulating the plant to focus on

140
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:22,759

141
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,759

diluted fertilizer mixture for about 20

146

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,560
This helps with light sterilization,

to strengthen the cellular structure of

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,959
the orchid flowers. This makes the

213
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,160
supplements nutrients, enhances the

plant's photosynthesis capacity and

215
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,079

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,880

insects in the orchid growing medium

437
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:22,900

away dirt, mold, and insects on the leaf

Place it in a place with lots of
