00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:09,899
If you want orchids to bloom a lot.

3
00:00:10,898 --> 00:00:16,897
Orchids always grow healthily.

4
00:00:16,897 --> 00:00:24,896
So let's explore organic fertilizers with me in this video.

5
00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:36,893
For safe composting today I used coffee grounds.

6
00:00:39,893 --> 00:00:46,891
Take 50 grams of coffee grounds.

7
00:00:51,644 --> 00:00:57,889
Next is fresh milk.

8
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:08,887
Take about 20ml of milk.

9
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:33,882
Next, we need fungal spores and Trichoderma - Bacillus bacteria. SP.

10
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:46,879
Take 1 spoon.

11
00:01:54,878 --> 00:02:03,876
Add a little warm water.

12
00:02:16,873 --> 00:02:26,871
Mix well and leave in a cool place for 3 days.

13
00:02:43,868 --> 00:02:46,867
After 3 days.

14
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:56,899
Take 2 liters of water.

15
00:03:00,032 --> 00:03:10,896
After 3 days, cells from fungi and bacteria Trichoderma and Bacillus. The product developed must be white in color.

16
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:26,893
Take 1 spoon about 20 grams.

17
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:46,889
Filter out residue.

18
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,953
First method.

19
00:04:02,907 --> 00:04:12,884
I apply this fertilizer to the roots every 2 weeks.

20
00:04:16,883 --> 00:04:26,881
Coffee grounds and milk contain many important nutrients such as nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium.

21
00:04:33,091 --> 00:04:43,878
When used as fertilizer, it helps promote their growth and flowering.

22
00:04:50,876 --> 00:05:00,874
Beneficial fungi and bacteria from trichoderma and Bacillus. SP after biomass will help protect roots from rot better.

23
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:16,871
Coffee grounds also have the ability to hold water, helping to maintain the necessary humidity for orchids.

24
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:28,869
Second method.

25
00:05:33,868 --> 00:05:42,899
Clean the top and bottom of the leaves with this water.

26
00:05:48,898 --> 00:05:58,896
Helps kill fungi, insects, and harmful bacteria very effectively.

27
00:06:19,323 --> 00:06:29,890
If you apply this method 1-2 times a month, the leaves will always be green and disease-free.

28
00:06:42,086 --> 00:06:44,086
Third method.

29
00:06:58,884 --> 00:07:07,882
You can also spray this fertilizer on the entire orchid plant.

30
00:07:10,882 --> 00:07:19,880
Like foliar fertilization for orchids.

31
00:07:20,347 --> 00:07:29,878
Coffee grounds often have a slightly acidic pH, reducing the alkalinity of the soil.

32
00:07:30,878 --> 00:07:39,876
This is beneficial for orchids because many orchids prefer soil environments with a slightly acidic pH.

33
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:56,873
Do not spray on flowers because wet flowers easily fall off.

34
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:05,871
Reault.

35
00:08:09,275 --> 00:08:19,868
After 1 month the roots grew very strongly.

36
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:30,899
This helps the plant roots absorb the most nutrients through the roots.

37
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:43,897
Flower buds also develop faster.

38
00:08:48,053 --> 00:08:58,894
Many flower stems grow on the same orchid.

39
00:09:06,395 --> 00:09:15,890
Flowers bloom with more vibrant colors.

40
00:09:24,111 --> 00:09:32,887
Flowers bloom for a long time.

41
00:09:34,887 --> 00:09:41,885
Hope the video will help you a lot.

00:09:44,402 --> 00:09:53,883
