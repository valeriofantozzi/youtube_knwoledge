[Music]

435
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,119
Eggshells contain many nutrients needed

436
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,640
by plants, including calcium, potassium,

437
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:58,560
and trace elements such as iron,

438
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,560
magnesium, manganese, copper, and

440
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:13,599
zinc. Therefore, eggshells will help

441
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:13,599
provide necessary nutrients for orchids.

442
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,400
Dry on low heat for 5

443
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:30,839

00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,839
diseases before using as fertilizer.

446
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,200
When using eggshells as fertilizer, it

447
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:50,360
also helps to increase the pH of the

448
00:41:47,200 --> 00:42:03,119

[Music]

450
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:08,319
In addition, I also use 100 g of organic

flowers bloom for a long

473
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:38,480

2 months, it is guaranteed that the

475
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:43,400

00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,800
this fertilizer to help flower buds grow

480
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,800

After the orchid has bloomed, what

543
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:13,760
should we do to help it grow and bloom

00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,359
your orchids stay healthy and bloom

547
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:27,200
regularly. Let's get

548
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:36,920
started. To make fertilizer for this

549
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:36,920
orchid, I need about 10 eggshells.

550
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,720
Uh eggshells are a natural source of

551
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:47,200
calcium which helps improve soil

552
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:51,240
structure, boost root development and

553
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,240
prevent diseases in orchids.

554
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,960
Using eggshells as fertilizer helps

555
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:10,559
orchids recover quickly after blooming,

556
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,559
stimulating continuous and healthy

557
00:49:16,839 --> 00:49:23,000

558
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:25,280

together from all over the world.

561
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,599
You need to dry the eggshells and then

562
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,599
grind them into

563
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:49,880
powder. Then put the eggshell powder

564
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,880
into the jar.

565
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,480
Next, bananas are a very good choice as

566
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,480
fertilizer for

567
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:18,650
orchids. Take one banana peel and cut it

568
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:21,729
into small pieces.

570
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,359
Banana peels are rich in potassium and

571
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:33,359
minerals which help stimulate flowering

572
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:35,599
and promote quick recovery for orchids

573
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:35,599
after

574
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,880

575
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:50,200
fertilizer ensures consistent and

576
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,200
healthy blooming.

577
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,400
Add one liter of boiling

00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:15,559
water. Cover and leave overnight to let

579
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:15,559
the nutrients mix into the water.

580
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:28,079
Next, I use oatmeal to make natural

581
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:39,960
fertilizer. Take three teaspoons of

582
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,960
oatmeal.

583
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,520
Add one liter of water at room

584
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:08,680
temperature. Cover and leave overnight

585
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:08,680
to let the nutrients mix into the water.

586
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:19,119
This is an orchid I bought at an

587
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:22,319
industrial orchid garden and has

588
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:22,319
finished blooming.

589
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:33,520
Uh to care for the plant to continue

590
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:37,000
flowering, I first need to cut off the

591
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,000
damaged leaves.

592
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,440
Then cut off the old flower

593
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:04,319
stems. If you haven't subscribed to the

the journey and supporting

597
00:53:16,839 --> 00:53:24,599
me. Then use coffee powder to apply to

598
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:24,599
the cut to help the wound heal quickly.

599
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,760
Leave it overnight for the cut to heal

600
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,760
completely.

601
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,359
After one

602
00:54:11,079 --> 00:54:17,559
night, stir well so that the nutrients

603
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,559
dissolve into the water.

604
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:40,200
Filter out eggshells and banana peels.

605
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:54,199
[Music]

606
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,319
Step

607
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:12,680
one, use soft cotton to wipe the leaves

608
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:12,680
to help keep them cleaner.

609
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:21,200
Wiping leaves helps remove dust, debris,

610
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:23,040
and bacteria from leaf surfaces, helping

611
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:26,520
orchid leaves breathe better and absorb

612
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:26,520
light more effectively.

613
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,520
Wiping leaves helps enhance

614
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:44,240
photosynthesis because clean leaves

615
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:47,880
absorb light better and can metabolize

616
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,880
energy more efficiently.

617
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,319
Wiping leaves with this water helps

618
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:11,119
reduce the risk of mold bacterial

619
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:12,640
diseases because clean leaf surfaces

620
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:16,599
limit the environment for harmful

621
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,599
pathogens to grow.

622
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,319
Step

623
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:52,520
two, pour this water into a spray bottle

624
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:52,520
and spray your orchid.

625
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,960
Spraying water infused with banana peels

626
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:03,520
and eggshells provides nutrients for

627
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:05,839
orchids, boosting their resistance,

628
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:09,280
promoting quick recovery after blooming,

629
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:09,280
and ensuring continuous

630
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:23,079
flowering. Thoroughly spray both the top

631
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:23,079
and bottom of the leaves.

632
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:34,079
When sprayed on leaves, liquid

633
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,319
fertilizer helps orchids absorb

634
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:39,319
nutrients more easily and enhance root

635
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:39,319
development.

636
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:10,820
[Music]

637
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:14,160
When sprayed on leaves, liquid

638
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,400
fertilizer helps orchids absorb

639
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:19,400
nutrients more easily and enhance root

640
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,400
development.

641
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:28,160
[Music]

642
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,839
will create a synthetic liquid

643
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:34,760
fertilizer solution that is very good

644
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:34,760
for orchids to recover after flowering.

645
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,280
Step

646
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:52,040
three, water this liquid fertilizer for

647
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:52,040
orchid pots.

648
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,599
Watering with a liquid fertilizer made

649
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:02,200
from banana peels, eggshells, and

650
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:04,720
oatmeal boosts nutrients, enhances

651
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:09,160
resistance, promotes quick recovery, and

652
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:09,160
ensures continuous blooming for orchids.

653
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:25,119
Uh, soak the orchid pot for 20 minutes

654
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:25,119
so the orchid can absorb the most

655
00:59:34,839 --> 00:59:39,200
nutrients. After soaking for about 20

656
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,720
minutes, take it out. Take it out and

657
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:44,119
place the orchid pot in a place with

658
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:44,119
plenty of light.

659
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:53,680
Step

660
00:59:51,079 --> 00:59:55,839
four, water droplets on leaves can

661
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:58,720
create a favorable environment for mold

662
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:58,720
and bacteria to

663
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:06,760
grow. Wiping off water helps reduce the

664
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,760
risk of infection.

665
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:17,359
Wiping off the water helps the stamata

666
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:17,359
stay open and function

667
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:37,480
better. And do the above four steps

668
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:37,480
every 10 to 15 days.

669
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:49,920
Remember, no matter how good the

670
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:52,000
fertilizer is, if the orchid lacks light

671
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:56,599
growth and cannot photosynthesize, it

672
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,599
will still be stunted and grow slowly.

673
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,880
Therefore, place the orchid in a

674
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:11,280
location with sufficient light for

675
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,280
healthy

676
01:01:20,119 --> 01:01:25,079
growth. Results after 50 days.

677
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:36,960
You can see the roots and leaves of the

678
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,960
orchid growing very

679
01:01:42,839 --> 01:01:47,680
quickly. The leaves are also stronger

680
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,680
and

681
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:58,319
glossier and also grew two new flower

682
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:58,319
buds.

683
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:31,119
Oh, the roots in the orchid pot grow so

684
01:02:36,839 --> 01:02:42,319
well. New roots are an important factor

685
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:47,160
in helping orchids grow healthily and

686
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:47,160
sustainably throughout their life cycle.

687
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:40,960
Um, now I plant it in a larger pot so

688
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,960
the orchid grows

689
01:03:47,799 --> 01:03:52,960
healthier. As a growing medium, I use

690
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:54,960
crushed pine bark to help airrate the

691
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:57,960
roots but still retain the necessary

692
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,960
moisture.

693
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:27,559
After planting, take care of it like

694
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:27,559
other normal orchids.

695
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,559
Take care of your orchids with all the

696
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:41,440
love and dedication you have for nature

697
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:43,599
because every leaf and every flower bud

698
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:46,319
is a testament to the effort and heart

699
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:46,319
you put into

700
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:58,680
it. Thank you for watching and
