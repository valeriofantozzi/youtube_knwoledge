00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,359
I am very happy to welcome everyone to

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,120
my channel where we explore natural

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,559
beauty and inspiring plant care methods

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:13,360
together. Today I want to share with you

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,759
an interesting way to grow orchids. No

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,560
need to water, yet the flowers can still

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,720
bloom brightly all year round. This is a

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,960
simple and creative solution, especially

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,480
helpful for those who love orchids but

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,640
don't have much time to care for them

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:31,039
everyday. Let's get started. This is a

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,040
small orchid that I bought from a local

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:37,440
flower shop. Although the plant is

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,440
small, it is growing very healthily and

15
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,920
vibrantly. To apply the method of

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,440
growing orchids without watering, the

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,440
first step is to remove all the old

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,600
growing medium, especially the

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,800
moss. Moss retains moisture very well,

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,079
which will prevent the plant from

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,079
growing properly using this method.

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,079
The next step is to cut off any damaged

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,000
or dry roots. This is important because

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,920
unhealthy roots not only reduce the

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,840
plant's ability to absorb neut

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,840
nutrients, but can also cause

27
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,400
diseases. Removing them will help the

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,240
orchid grow stronger, creating a solid

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,640
foundation for growing using the no

30
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,640
watering method.

[Music]

32
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:37,360
[Music]

33
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,520
To ensure the orchid doesn't rot during

34
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,720
the growing process, I use baking soda

35
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,720
to treat the cuts on the roots.

36
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,079
Baking soda helps kill bacteria and

37
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,520
fungi, preventing the formation of

38
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,600
pathogens while creating a clean

39
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,040
environment for the roots to

40
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,680
grow. Just half a teaspoon of baking

41
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,680
soda is

42
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:11,720
enough. Then mix it with.5 L of water.

43
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,959
Um, after preparing the baking soda

44
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,519
solution, soak the orchid in it for

45
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,519
about 10 minutes.

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,760
Soaking the plant helps disinfect

47
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:45,760
effectively, ensuring that the roots are

48
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,760
protected from bacteria and mold before

49
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,360
planting. This is an important step that

50
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,800
helps the orchid stay healthy and grow

51
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,800
well throughout the care

52
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:00,640
[Music]

53
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,560
process. Next, I prepare rice to make a

54
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,319
natural fertilizer that helps stimulate

55
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,879
the rapid growth of the orchid after

56
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,120
planting.

57
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,400
Take one tablespoon of rice and soak it

58
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,640
in 0.5 L of water. This mixture will

59
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,280
provide essential nutrients to help the

60
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,280
orchid grow

61
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,680
healthily. Um, it's best to let the

62
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,440
mixture soak for about 10 to 30 minutes.

63
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,920
This helps the nutrients in the rice

64
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,959
dissolve into the water, creating a

65
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,879
nutrientrich natural fertilizer for the

66
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,480
plant. While waiting, I will recycle

67
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,799
plastic bottle caps to make a no

68
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,720

to remove any dirt or impurities left.

87
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,320
This will help ensure a clean growing

88
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,160

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,120
need to cut it off immediately to

122
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,680
prevent it from spreading to the healthy

125
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,000
help the orchid focus its energy on

126
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,000
growing and keep the entire plant

127
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000

natural nutrients from the rice,

134
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:37,479
stimulate recovery, and promote growth

soak up any excess water on the leaves

159
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,360
and between the leaf

towel to gently dry these areas,

162
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,040
preventing the orchid from rotting

165
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,920
When planting the orchid, we connect the

166
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,760
wick to the roots to ensure that water

167
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,120
is drawn up from the bottom of the pot

168
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,120
to the roots.

169
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,200
Then insert the growing medium such as

170
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,880
pine bark chips around the roots to

171
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,279
retain moisture and create space for the

172
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,279
roots to develop.

173
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,440
This growing medium helps the orchid

174
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:05,160
stay stable and grow strong in the no

175
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,160
water planting environment.

176
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,279
After planting, we only need to water

177
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,399
once. to allow the growing medium and

178
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,399
wick to absorb enough

179
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,079
moisture. Then you only need to change

180
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,760
the water when it becomes dirty. This

181
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,839
helps keep the orchid healthy without

182
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,959
the need for frequent watering while

183
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,959
also preventing root

184
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,279
rot. The wick will act as a bridge

185
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,079
allowing water to be drawn up from the

186
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,920
bottom of the pot to the roots. This

187
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,160
way, the orchid will always receive the

188
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,200
necessary moisture naturally without the

189
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,200
need for direct

190
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,959
watering. After planting, we wait for

191
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,760
about a week to allow the orchid roots

192
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:41,360
to stabilize in the new environment.

193
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,120
Once the roots are settled, you can

194
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,440
start fertilizing the orchid to support

195
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,440
its

196
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,879
[Music]

197
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:03,240
growth. After a week, I start

198
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,240
fertilizing the orchid with rice water.

199
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:15,880
Take one tablespoon of rice. Then mix it

200
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,880
with one liter of water and stir well.

201
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:23,370
[Music]

202
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,480
After the rice has soaked, strain the

203
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:48,480
rice water to use as fertilizer for the

204
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,240
orchid. Rice water contains many natural

205
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,079
nutrients that help stimulate the growth

206
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,079
of the orchid's roots, leaves, and

207
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:59,839
flowers. After preparing the rice water,

208
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,480
soak the orchid pot in this solution for

209
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,480
about 20 minutes.

210
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,800
Soaking the plant in rice water allows

211
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,399
the roots to absorb nutrients

212
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:13,160
gradually. Uh each month you only need

213
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,760
to soak the orchid pot in rice water

214
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,760
twice. Soaking the plant in rice water

215
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,760
allows the roots to absorb nutrients

216
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,760
gradually.

217
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,880
This helps maintain healthy growth for

218
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,880
the orchid without the need for frequent

219
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,880
watering.

220
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,279
After soaking the orchid pot in rice

221
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,720
water for 20 minutes, remove the pot and

222
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,800
wait for the rice water to drain

223
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,519
completely before placing the pot into

224
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,519
the water container.

225
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,880
There. Uh then remove the pot and place

226
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,720
it in a spot with indirect sunlight.

227
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,720
Note that good fertilizer and the right

228
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,480
planting method will only be effective

229
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,160
if the orchid receives enough sunlight.

230
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,759
If there is a lack of sunlight, the

231
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,600
orchid will not grow well and the

232
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,600
fertilizer will not work at its full

233
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,730
potential. And now let's take a look at

234
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:03,480
the results. After 2

[Music]

236
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:10,400

237
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,400
clean white roots and shiny green

238
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:20,880

239
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,439

240
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,199
I revived this little orchid? Don't

252
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,559
The most wonderful part is that the

253
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,880
flowers have bloomed beautifully, full

254
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:04,469

simple and natural method, we can help a

258
