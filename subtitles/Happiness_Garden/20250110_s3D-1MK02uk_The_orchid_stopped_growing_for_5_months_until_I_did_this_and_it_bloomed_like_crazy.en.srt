Garden today I'll be introducing you to

3
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:09,240
a special natural fertilizer that not

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,519
only helps orchids grow sustainably but

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,719
also supports weak orchids in recovering

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,639
so they can become healthy again and

7
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:16,639
continue blooming

beautifully stay tuned until the end of

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,520
the video to discover the recipe and how

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,600
to use this fertilizer

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,880
if you have a wilted Orchid like this

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,880
don't throw it

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,280
away in this video I will share how to

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,280
revive it and help it grow strong

17
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,000
again if orchids are not properly cared

18
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,160
for after flowering they will be weak

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,160
and

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,799
stunted first I need to check the

21
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,920
roots when roots are damaged they can't

22
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,119
absorb water and nutrients for the plant

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,920
um causing the Orchid to become weak and

24
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,920
prone to disease

25
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,799
removing damaged Roots helps stop the

26
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,479
spread of bacteria and fungi while also

27
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,479
encouraging the growth of new healthier

28
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,320

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,320

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,319
next cut off the old flower stem and the

32
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,200
plant will focus its energy on growing

33
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:22,760
new roots and leaves while also

34
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,760

00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:56,000
plant stay healthier

39
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,519
