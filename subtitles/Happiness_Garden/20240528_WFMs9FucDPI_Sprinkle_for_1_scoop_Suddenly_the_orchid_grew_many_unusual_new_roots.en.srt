welcome to my channel

2
00:00:05,865 --> 00:00:12,898
If you have an orchid with yellow leaves and weak roots, don't miss this video

3
00:00:17,422 --> 00:00:23,896
First, remove all yellow leaves and damaged roots

4
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:47,958
Tell me where you come from

5
00:00:48,957 --> 00:00:56,956
Let me create subtitles for your country's language so we can communicate easily

6
00:01:11,442 --> 00:01:18,885
Then use small pine bark to replant this orchid

00:02:05,414 --> 00:02:12,874
Spread a layer of moss on the surface of the orchid pot to help retain moisture better

9
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:36,669
Take 2 tablespoons of white vinegar

10
00:02:54,179 --> 00:03:00,898
mix 4 liters of water

11
00:03:22,988 --> 00:03:30,959
Step 1: Clean orchid leaves with this water

12
00:03:33,704 --> 00:03:40,890
Vinegar water helps remove limescale and dirt from leaves

13
00:03:43,663 --> 00:03:50,888
Leaves will photosynthesize sunlight better

14
00:03:54,562 --> 00:04:02,886
At the same time, it eliminates leaf-damaging insects that often hide on the underside of leaves

15
00:04:05,961 --> 00:04:12,884
such as red spider mites, leafhoppers, aphids and thrips are harmful

16
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:32,880
If you don't understand, don't hesitate to comment so we can help you

17
00:04:53,320 --> 00:05:00,874
Doing this 1-2 times a month will help orchid leaves stay green and prevent disease on the leaves

18
00:05:11,859 --> 00:05:20,870
Then take 1 teaspoon of sugar and mix it with the vinegar water

19
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:50,898
Step 2: Water this water on the orchid roots

20
00:05:56,628 --> 00:06:04,895
Vinegar combined with sugar helps stimulate rooting very quickly and extremely well

21
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:14,963
Vinegar helps kill insects that damage orchid roots

22
00:06:14,963 --> 00:06:23,748
Sugar helps provide nutrients and create an environment for beneficial root microorganisms to grow

23
00:06:27,326 --> 00:06:33,889
Soak in this water for 30 minutes

24
00:06:40,812 --> 00:06:48,886
Then take it out and place it in a cool place with enough light for the orchid to grow

25
00:06:54,596 --> 00:07:01,884
Use the remaining water for other healthy orchids

26
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,981
Helps plants grow and increase resistance to pests

27
00:07:21,183 --> 00:07:29,878
Water weak orchids and healthy orchids twice a month with this water

28
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,873
1 MONTH LATER

29
00:08:02,165 --> 00:08:09,870
After only 1 month, the orchid has developed many new roots

30
00:08:18,557 --> 00:08:26,900
These new roots will absorb the best water and nutrients, helping the orchid grow quickly

31
00:08:38,528 --> 00:08:46,896
Hopefully the video content will help you how to care for orchids at home

00:08:51,435 --> 00:08:58,894
