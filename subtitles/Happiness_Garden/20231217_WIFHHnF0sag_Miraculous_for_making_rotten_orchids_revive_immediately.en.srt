Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,998
Today I will show you how to revive a rotten orchid like this.

3
00:00:11,998 --> 00:00:22,236
When the orchid has withered all the leaves, only the stem and roots remain, do not rush to throw it away.

4
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:56,223
Here are still fresh roots.

5
00:00:56,223 --> 00:01:22,611
First, cut off all damaged, rotten roots.

6
00:01:34,262 --> 00:01:56,078
Apply a molten candle on the cut so that the water does not penetrate the tree.

7
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:33,004
Use 2 teaspoons of cinnamon powder.

8
00:02:41,831 --> 00:03:03,031
Add 1 liter of boiled water.

9
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:18,028
Close the lid and wait for the water to cool.

10
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:31,025
The water has cooled down

11
00:03:31,025 --> 00:04:07,203
Filter out residue.

12
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:28,081
Soak orchids in this water for 30 minutes.

13
00:04:34,248 --> 00:05:11,072
The rest of the water I will spray on other orchids to help protect the orchid from insects and fungal diseases

14
00:05:14,803 --> 00:05:25,736
After soaking for 30 minutes, plant it.

15
00:05:25,736 --> 00:05:43,380
Using pine bark and dry pumice stone to plant will help absorb moisture in the roots, making the orchid roots not rot.

16
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:49,614
Add some dry moss on the face.

17
00:05:49,614 --> 00:05:54,068
Put in a cool and well-lit place for 7 days

18
00:05:54,068 --> 00:06:06,695
After 7 days, you can spray water to keep the plants moist.

19
00:06:12,093 --> 00:06:21,092
Cover with a clear, vented plastic container and wait for the plant to revive.

20
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:30,090
AFTER 3 WEEKS,

21
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:37,075
A sprout has sprouted,

22
00:06:37,075 --> 00:06:48,248
Spray water once every 5 days to keep the sprouts moist

23
00:06:50,703 --> 00:07:16,081
AFTER 2 MONTHS

24
00:07:16,081 --> 00:07:26,945
