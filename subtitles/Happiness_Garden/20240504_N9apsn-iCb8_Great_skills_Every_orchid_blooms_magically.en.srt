5
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:32,961
Now let's get started.

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:46,830
To make this organic fertilizer you need coffee or coffee grounds.

7
00:00:50,124 --> 00:01:06,107
I use 3 teaspoons.

8
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:32,033
Add 1 liter of boiled water.

9
00:01:48,137 --> 00:01:58,695
Incubate until cool.

10
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:22,546
After the water cools, filter to remove residue.

11
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:40,169
Add water to make 5 liters of coffee solution.

12
00:02:59,089 --> 00:03:21,759
Next add 1 teaspoon of baking soda.

13
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:36,758
FIRST METHOD

14
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:51,988
Water this fertilizer solution on the orchid roots.

15
00:03:57,748 --> 00:04:07,718
 
Coffee contains many minerals and organic matter helps provide orchid nutrition.

16
00:04:15,337 --> 00:04:22,315
It contains nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus,

17
00:04:27,874 --> 00:04:36,846
Important nutritional elements for orchid growth.

18
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:51,209
Baking soda (bicarbonate soda) has the ability to increase the PH level in orchid pots,

19
00:04:55,075 --> 00:05:04,206
This is helpful in reducing acidity if you use too much chemical fertilizer.

20
00:05:12,305 --> 00:05:22,303
Baking soda has the ability to kill insects and fungi that damage plants.

21
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,433
SECOND METHOD

22
00:05:56,621 --> 00:06:06,595
Spray this fertilizer on the entire orchid.

23
00:06:15,987 --> 00:06:25,957
This method is similar to using foliar fertilizer.

24
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:46,987
You can use it as a natural pesticide to protect orchids from insects and diseases.

25
00:07:05,001 --> 00:07:08,982
THIRD METHOD

26
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:26,879
Clean the leaf surface with this fertilizer solution.

27
00:07:39,191 --> 00:07:48,174
The leaf surface will always be clean and airy with stomata.

28
00:07:58,526 --> 00:08:08,504
Orchids will photosynthesize better.

29
00:08:18,658 --> 00:08:22,868
RESULT

30
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:36,731
Plant roots are protected and supplemented with nutrients so they grow very healthily.

31
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:56,028
will help orchids absorb the most nutrients.

32
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:08,359
Because of enough nutrition, the flowers bloom more brilliantly.

33
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:26,888
Many flowers bloom on the same branch.

34
00:09:36,024 --> 00:09:46,018
The flowers stay on the branches for a long time before fading.

35
00:09:48,051 --> 00:09:55,049
