to share with you a simple yet effective

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,560
way to make natural fertilizer, helping

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,400
orchids stay healthy and continuously

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,600
show off their vibrant beauty throughout

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,600
all four seasons of the year.

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,760
If you also love orchids and want your

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,760

wonderful to have you with me.

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,840
Let's get

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,320
started. The first ingredient I will use

23
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,000
to create natural fertilizer is

24
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:15,159
eggshells. An easily available resource

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,600
that is full of nutrients for

26
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:19,360
orchids. Take two to three eggshells,

27
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,400
then wash them under running water to

28
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,400
remove any dirt and impurities.

29
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,560
Please let me know which country you're

30
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,400
watching the video

31
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:38,600
from. It's so amazing that we can chat

32
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,600
with each other from all over the world.

33
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,000
Next, place the eggshells upside down so

34
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,439
the water can drain out, allowing them

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,439
to dry and be ready for the next steps.

36
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,080
The next ingredient I will use to make

37
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,000
natural fertilizer is dried banana

38
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:25,599
peels, a component rich in potassium and

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,599
other wonderful nutrients for

40
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,800
orchids. Take two banana peels and wash

41
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,360
them under running water to remove any

42
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,360
dirt and impurities.

43
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,640
Or you can also use fresh banana peels

44
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,640
as they are also very good for

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,239
orchids. If you use fresh banana peels

46
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,319
to make natural fertilizer, remember to

47
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,519
wash the peels thoroughly before eating

48
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,519
to remove dirt and impurities.

49
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,480
After washing, let the banana peels dry

50
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,480
and be ready for the next

51
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,680
steps. The next ingredient I will use to

52
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,599
make natural fertilizer is beetroot. An

53
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,599
excellent source of nutrients for

54
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,599
orchids.

55
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,840
Uh, when eating beetroot, I often use

56
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,920
the peel to make fertilizer for orchids,

57
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,879
helping to provide additional nutrients

58
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,879
for the plant to grow

59
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,519
healthily. Uh, when eating beetroot, I

60
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,120
often use the peel to make fertilizer

61
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,200
for orchids, helping to provide

62
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,440
additional nutrients for the plant to

63
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,440
grow healthily.

64
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,159
After chopping the beetroot peels into

65
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,120
small pieces, I place them into a jar to

66
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,120
prepare for the next steps.

67
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,040
Next, I chop the banana peels into small

68
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,600
pieces and add them to the jar with the

69
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,600
beetroot

70
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:40,639
[Music]

71
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,320
peels. Next, I crush the eggshells and

72
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,320
add them to the jar along with the other

73
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,320
ingredients.

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,720
Uh, eggshells contain a lot of calcium,

75
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,720
a nutrient that is essential for helping

76
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,199
orchids grow strong and produce

77
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,199
beautiful

78
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:16,160
blooms. Then I add all the ingredients

79
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,160
into one liter of boiled water.

80
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,479
Close the lid and let it sit overnight,

81
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,600
allowing the nutrients from the

82
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,520
ingredients to dissolve into the water.

83
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,520
The next morning, you will have a

84
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,520
wonderful natural fertilizer for your

85
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,520
orchids.

86
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:44,569
[Music]

87
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,240
The next morning, stir well to ensure

88
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,950
the nutrients are completely dissolved

89
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,520
into the

90
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:57,600
[Music]

91
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,520
water. Then we strain the mixture to

92
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,880
collect the clear liquid which will be

93
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,880
used as fertilizer for the orchids.

94
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:19,490

95
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,260
[Music]

96
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,379
[Music]

97
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,360
After straining, add another liter of

98
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,639
water to make a total of 2 L of liquid

99
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,919
[Music]

100
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:48,319
fertilizer. The final ingredient, add

101
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:52,600
about 1 teaspoon of neem oil to complete

102
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,600
the natural fertilizer solution.

103
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,160
Neem oil helps to repel insects, prevent

104
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,479
fungal diseases, and promote healthy

105
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,479
plant

106
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,840
growth. Remember to stir well to ensure

107
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,840
the neem oil is fully dissolved in the

108
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,840
solution.

109
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:18,199
[Music]

110
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,759
Step one, use a soft cloth to soak the

111
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,830
mixture and gently wipe the top and

112
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,319
bottom of the

113
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:33,840
[Music]

114
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:36,240
leaves. Wiping the leaves helps remove

115
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,479
dirt, creating conditions for the plant

116
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,400
to photosynthesize more easily,

117
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,800
promoting healthy leaves and boosting

118
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,800
flower productivity.

119
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,360
This mixture provides essential

120
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,960
nutrients such as calcium from

121
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,960
eggshells, potassium from banana peels,

122
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,960
and beetroot, helping orchids grow

123
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:06,400
healthy. Neem oil has antibacterial and

124
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,479
antifungal properties, helping the plant

125
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,479
prevent common diseases like fungi and

126
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,479
bacteria.

127
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,039
Neem oil is a natural substance that

128
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,440
helps repel harmful insects such as

129
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:22,319
aphids and spidermitites, protecting the

130
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,319
leaves from pest

131
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:27,000
attacks. Cleaning the leaves and

132
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,360
providing nutrients helps the plant

133
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,599
photosynthesize more effectively,

134
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,599
thereby promoting growth and longlasting

135
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,599
blooms.

136
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,320
The liquid fertilizer mixture also helps

137
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,120
maintain the necessary moisture on the

138
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,399
leaves, especially in dry environments,

139
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,399
supporting better plant

140
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:52,320
growth. You should wipe the leaves about

141
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:57,080
twice a month so that the orchid can

142
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,080
absorb nutrients well and stay healthy.

143
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,640
After wiping the leaves, pour the

144
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,880
remaining mixture into a spray bottle to

145
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,880
use

146
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,200
later. If you haven't subscribed to the

orchid growing tips. It's wonderful to

150
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,480
have you with me.

151
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,399
Step two, use a spray bottle to evenly

152
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,880
spray the mixture over the entire

153
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,399
orchid, including the stem, leaves, and

154
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,920
base of the

155
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:36,080
plant. The mixture provides nutrients

156
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,160
directly through the leaves and stem,

157
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,000
helping the plant absorb them faster and

158
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,000
promoting healthy growth from roots to

159
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
tip.

160
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,480
Neem oil in the mixture helps prevent

161
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,760
pests and fungi, protecting the plant

162
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,760
from harmful environmental

163
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,680
factors. Potassium and calcium from

164
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,200
natural ingredients help stimulate

165
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,680
flowering and extend the blooming

166
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,279
period, resulting in evenly distributed

167
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,279
flowers with vibrant colors that last

168
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,279
longer.

169
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,120
It is recommended to spray two to three

170
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,120
times a month to maintain the nurturing

171
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,440
and protective effects for the

172
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:19,440
orchid. Step three, water each orchid

173
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,880
pot with about 10 tablespoons of this

174
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,160
natural fertilizer

175
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,560
mixture. Watering with the fertilizer

176
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,640
mixture helps provide a steady supply of

177
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,720
nutrients to the plant from the roots to

178
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,040
the leaves, promoting stronger and

179
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,040
healthier growth.

180
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,640
Watering with the fertilizer mixture

181
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,720
helps provide a steady supply of

182
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,800
nutrients to the plant from the roots to

183
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,279
the leaves, promoting stronger and

184
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,200
healthier

185
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:47,680
growth. It is recommended to water one

186
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,160
to two times a month, depending on the

187
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:54,079
plant's needs and environmental

188
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,920
conditions. Step four, use a soft cloth

189
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,680
to wipe off any water droplets on the

190
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,600
leaves and between the leaf crevices to

191
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,360
avoid excess moisture, keeping the

192
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,360
leaves dry and healthy.

193
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,519
In addition to the English voiceover, we

194
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,800
have now created voiceovers in French,

195
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,600
German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese,

196
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,519
Japanese, Hindi, and Indonesian to help

197
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,240
you listen to and understand the content

198
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,680

199
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,200
easily. To listen in a language, open

200
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,040
the video and click on settings, the

201
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,440
gear icon, to select the appropriate

202
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,440
audio language.

203
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,480
Then place the orchid in a spot with

204
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,640
gentle sunlight so it can

205
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,560
photosynthesize well, helping it grow

206
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,560
strong and produce beautiful

207
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,279
flowers. For orchids with leaf rot

208
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:52,920
caused by insects or fungi, we need to

209
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,920
treat them as follows.

210
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,320
We need to check and remove the rotting

211
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,050
leaves from the plant as soon as

212
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:06,600
possible to stop the spread of the

213
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:08,880
[Music]

214
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,200
disease. You can see that the rotting

215
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,500
orchid leaves have many small insects

216
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,779
appearing on them.

217
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,779
[Music]

218
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,250
[Music]

219
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,919
[Music]

220
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,440
If we don't treat it promptly, the rot

221
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,519
will spread to the stem and down to the

222
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,399
roots, causing the orchid to die very

223
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,399
quickly.

224
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:06,590
[Music]

225
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,120
After cutting off the rotting leaves,

226
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,519
you should dispose of them or keep them

227
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,160
far away from the garden to prevent the

228
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,160
spread of the

229
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:36,040
disease. Then use a soft cloth to dab

230
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:39,040
the fertilizer mixture made from

231
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,440
eggshells, banana peels, beetroot peels,

232
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,040
and neem oil to thoroughly wipe both the

233
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,480
top and bottom of the

234
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,720
leaves. Neem oil in the mixture has

235
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,720
antibacterial properties, helping to

236
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,560
kill the fungi and bacteria that cause

237
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,510
leaf rot, preventing the spread of the

238
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,040
disease on the orchid.

239
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:59,199
[Music]

240
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,519
The components from eggshells, banana

241
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,959
peels, and beetroot peels provide

242
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,639
essential nutrients, helping the orchid

243
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,639
recover quickly and return to good

244
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,719
[Music]

245
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,519
health. Then use turmeric powder to

246
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,199
sprinkle on the cut and rot spots to

247
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:25,519
help with antibacterial action and

248
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,519
promote fast healing of the wound.

249
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,560
After sprinkling the turmeric powder, do

250
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:36,240
not water for one week to allow the cut

251
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,240
and rot spots to dry and

252
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:44,160
heal. Once the wound and rot spots have

253
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:47,880
fully healed, you can then water and

254
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,880
fertilize the plant.

255
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,279
After the wound heals, I will use the

256
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,959
fertilizer made from eggshells, banana

257
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:59,040
peels, beetroot peels, and neem oil to

258
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,680
care for the orchid. And I will share

259
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,680
the results with

260
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:07,040
you. Once completed, remember to place

261
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,720
the orchid pot in a spot with gentle

262
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:13,320
sunlight so the plant can

263
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,320
photosynthesize well and grow healthily.

264
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,240
And here are the results after 3 weeks

265
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,240
of

266
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:31,519
care. Uh you can see that the orchid

267
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,519
leaves have become greener, shinier, and

268
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,440
sturdier. Um the leaves have also become

269
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,519
thicker, which shows that the orchid is

270
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,079
growing healthily and absorbing

271
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,079
nutrients well.

272
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,320
The orchid has also grown many new

273
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,040
roots, proving that the care process is

274
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,040
yielding good

275
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,680
results. These new roots will help the

276
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,000
orchid absorb nutrients more

277
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,800
effectively, supporting strong growth

278
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,800
and beautiful flowering.

279
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,120
And here is the orchid that was

280
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,120
previously affected by rot 10. You can

281
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,440
see that the rot spots have completely

282
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,440
healed and haven't spread any further.

283
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,120
After being cared for with natural

284
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,600
fertilizer, the orchid leaves have

285
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,680
become greener, shinier, and sturdier,

286
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,690
indicating that the plant has absorbed

287
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,749
nutrients well and is growing
