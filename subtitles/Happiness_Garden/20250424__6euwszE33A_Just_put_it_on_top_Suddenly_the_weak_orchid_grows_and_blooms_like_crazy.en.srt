Welcome to my orchid garden.

5
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,280
If the potting medium is not replaced

6
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,760
after a long time, the orchid roots may

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,760
rot and lose their ability to absorb

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,280
water and nutrients, which will cause

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,600
the plant to become stunted and

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,600
gradually

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,160
weaken. This orchid of mine is gradually

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,160
deteriorating with wilted, lifeless

13
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,160
leaves.

14
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,800
The important thing right now is to

15
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,450
check the potting medium and observe

16
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,650
whether the root system is

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,960
roots in the potting medium have rotted,

31
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,640
preventing the plant from absorbing

32
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,730
water and nutrients, which has led to

33
00:01:48,640 --> 00:02:02,170
its weakened condition.

00:01:50,730 --> 00:02:02,170
[Music]

35
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,399
After checking, the next step is to

36
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,000
remove all the damaged roots so the

37
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,319
plant has a chance to regenerate and

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,319
grow again.

39
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,200
Removing the damaged roots helps stop

40
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,440
the spread of diseases. The rotting

41
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,920
roots may contain harmful bacteria or

42
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,480
fungi and if not removed they can spread

43
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,480
to the healthy roots.

44
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,950
[Music]

45
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,599
Secondly, removing the damaged roots

46
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,599
allows the plant to focus on developing

47
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,360
a stronger, healthier root system,

48
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,360
making it easier to absorb water and

49
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,040
nutrients. And removing the damaged

50
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,959
roots helps reduce the risk of rotting

51
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,280
in the potting medium, keeping the

52
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,040
growing environment clean and airy,

53
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,599
which creates the best conditions for

54
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,599
the plant to

55
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,760
thrive. To help the plant recover

56
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,680
better, we need to remove the flower

57
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,519
spike, allowing all the nutrients to

58
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,519
focus on developing new leaves and

59
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:51,360
roots. After removing the damaged parts,

60
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,440
wash the orchid under running water to

61
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,440
help remove any impurities and clean the

62
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,440
roots.

63
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,400
To ensure the orchid is properly

64
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,320
disinfected, I will use baking soda and

65
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,440
easy defined ingredient that is very

66
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,440
effective in killing

67
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:04,080
pathogens. Take one teaspoon of baking

68
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,840
soda and mix it with.5 L of water,

69
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,639
stirring well to create the solution for

70
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,639

After mixing, soak the orchid in the

74
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,639
eliminate pathogens.

To naturally supplement nutrients for

76
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:23,840
the plant, I use black tea bags, a

77
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,840
gentle and mineral rich way to fertilize

78
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,479

79
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,400
brewed with one liter of hot water to

80
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,090
create a natural fertilizer solution for

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,240

Additionally, you can see that the

194
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,920
orchid has grown two new leaves, which

195
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,759

227
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,440
