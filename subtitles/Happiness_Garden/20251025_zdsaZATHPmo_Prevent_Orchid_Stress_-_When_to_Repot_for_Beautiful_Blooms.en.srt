00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,960
Welcome to the Happiness Garden channel.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,599
In my hands is an orchid pot whose last

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,440
petals have just closed.

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,679
When the radiant beauty of the flowers

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,240
fades, the plant enters its resting and

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,720
recovery phase. This is the perfect time

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,119
for us to repot it, giving the roots a

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,279
new airy space to grow strong and

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,279
healthy. From this point on, the plant

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,320
will gradually store energy for fresh

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,320
blooms in the coming season.

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,079
Now we will cut off the faded flower

13
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,120
spike to help the plant focus its

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,879
nutrients on the resting phase. By

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,040
removing the old spike, all the plant's

16
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,520
energy will be redirected to the roots

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,920
and leaves instead of maintaining the

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,920
dried stems.

19
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,479
Next, we gently remove the plant from

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,880
the pot and observe the roots.

21
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,119
The roots that are dry, mushy, or dark

22
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,159
brown are signs of rot, and you should

23
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,920
cut them off. Removing the damaged roots

24
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,040
will help prevent disease and stimulate

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,040
the healthy roots to grow stronger.

26
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,240
Since the growing medium is still quite

27
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,799
new and loose, I will remove only half

28
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,799
of the old medium.

29
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,680
Keeping part of the familiar growing

30
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,600
medium helps the plant avoid shock when

31
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,600
moving to a new environment while still

32
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,159
ensuring ventilation and cleanliness for

33
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,880
the roots. This method helps the plant

34
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,479
adapt faster, maintain stable moisture,

35
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,479
and continue to grow naturally and

36
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,479
gently.

37
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,400
Uh, leave me a comment and let me know

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,640
which country you're watching from. It's

39
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:25,480
wonderful that we can connect and chat

40
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,480
together from all around the world.

41
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,640

44
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,480
care tips. It's wonderful to have you

45
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,480
with me.

46
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,239
Next, I use coffee to prepare a special

47
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,239
care solution for the plant. Coffee not

48
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,400
only gently disinfects the roots and

49
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,879
growing medium, but also provides

50
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,599
natural nutrients that help stimulate

51
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,599
stronger root growth.

52
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,599
Just one teaspoon of pure coffee powder

53
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:27,239
is enough to create a highly effective

54
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,239
root care solution.

55
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,480
Pour 500 ml of hot water into the coffee

56
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,239
powder and stir well until the water

57
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,239
turns a rich dark brown color.

58
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,480
uh after mixing, cover the container and

59
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,040
let it steep until the water cools

60
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,959
completely. Steeping helps the nutrients

61
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,480
in the coffee blend evenly into the

62
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,280
water while keeping a safe temperature

63
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,280
for the roots when watering.

64
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,960
Once the water has completely cooled,

65
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,720
stir the solution again to ensure the

66
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,720
nutrients are evenly dissolved in the

67
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
water.

68
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,639
Next, strain out the coffee grounds,

69
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,720
keeping only the clear solution. This

70
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,400
makes the watering gentle, prevents

71
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,479
clogging of the growing medium or young

72
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,440
roots, and ensures the nutrients are

73
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,440
absorbed to the fullest.

74
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,919
After straining out the grounds, add one

75
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,240
liter of water to dilute the solution.

76
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,919
This step makes the solution gentle,

77
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,160
just enough for the roots to absorb

78
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,840
without being too strong, while evenly

79
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,160
distributing nutrients throughout the

80
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,160
growing media.

81
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,919
Next, pour the diluted solution over the

82
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:52,000
roots and growing medium, letting them

83
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,600
soak for about 20 minutes.

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,919
This time is enough for the roots to

85
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,479
absorb nutrients from the coffee while

86
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,560
gently disinfecting and removing any

87
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,880
remaining bacteria or mold in the

88
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,880
growing medium.

89
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,560
While waiting for the roots and old

90
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,639
growing medium to soak, we take the

91
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,639
opportunity to prepare the new growing

92
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,639
medium.

93
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,880
Um, pour the diluted coffee solution

94
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,440
over the new growing medium and let it

95
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,680
soak for about 20 minutes. This time not

96
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,720
only helps disinfect the medium,

97
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,639
removing bacteria and mold, but also

98
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,120
allows the nutrients from the coffee to

99
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,880
permeate each particle. When planting

100
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,720
the orchid, the roots will come into

101
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,960
direct contact with the nutrient-rich

102
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,240
medium, supporting strong growth and

103
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,560
preparing for the next growth and

104
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,560
blooming cycle.

105
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,560
Any leftover diluted coffee solution can

106
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,560
be applied with a soft cloth to gently

107
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,560
wipe both the top and underside of the

108
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,560
leaves.

109
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,599
This method helps remove dust while

110
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,240
allowing the nutrients to gently adhere

111
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,319
to the leaf surface. supporting partial

112
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,039
nutrient absorption and enhancing the

113
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,039
plant's overall health.

114
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,919
After wiping, the leaves will become

115
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,759
clean and vibrant, and the orchid will

116
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,160
be ready to grow strongly during its

117
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,160
resting phase.

118
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,240
After soaking for about 20 minutes, we

119
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,240
gently remove the orchid from the

120
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,240
solution.

121
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,159
Next, let the plant rest and the growing

122
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,000
medium dry naturally for one day. This

123
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,399
process helps stabilize the roots,

124
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,399
prevent root rot when replanting, and

125
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,760
prepares the plant to absorb nutrients

126
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,760
better when transferred to the new

127
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,760
medium.

128
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,839
Then scoop out the new growing medium

129
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,399
and let it drain for about a day before

130
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,120
replanting the orchid. This ensures the

131
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,279
medium is moderately dry, preventing the

132
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,680
roots from being water logged or rotting

133
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,920
when planted.

134
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,000
When planted into the drained medium,

135
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,560
the roots will come into contact with an

136
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,959
ideal environment, absorb nutrients

137
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:23,560
efficiently, and grow strong, preparing

138
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,560
for the next growth and blooming cycle.

139
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,160
After one day, when the growing medium

140
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,959
has completely drained, we can proceed

141
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,959
to replant the orchid.

142
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,399
You should choose a pot with drainage

143
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,480
holes to plant the orchid. The drainage

144
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,320
holes allow excess water in the medium

145
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,760
to escape, preventing the roots from

146
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,760
becoming water logged or rotting.

147
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,959
Place a few pieces of foam at the bottom

148
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,880
of the pot to support drainage and keep

149
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,880
the roots from touching the bottom

150
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,880
directly.

151
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,680
Then gently position the orchid in the

152
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,079
pot and cover it with the growing

153
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,560
medium, taking care not to break or

154
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,560
damage the roots.

155
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,760
Next, slowly pack the growing medium

156
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,920
around the roots, filling any gaps in

157
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,920
the pot.

158
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,640
Make sure the medium surrounds the roots

159
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,480
evenly but is not packed too tightly,

160
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,959
allowing the roots space to breathe and

161
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,519
grow. When finished, the plant will

162
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,440
stand firmly in the pot with roots in

163
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,680
good contact with the nutrient-rich

164
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,680
medium ready for recovery and strong

165
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,680
growth.

166
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,760
Both the new and old growing medium have

167
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,760
reached the appropriate moisture level.

168
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,320
So after planting, you should let the

169
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,720
plant rest for about 3 days without

170
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,720
additional watering.

171
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,440
After 3 days, when the roots have

172
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,560
stabilized and the plant is no longer in

173
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:25,079
shock, we proceed to prepare the natural

174
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,079
fertilizer to water the plant.

175
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,120
Take three teaspoons of rice to prepare

176
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,959
the natural fertilizer. The rice will

177
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,440
provide a slowrelease source of

178
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,279
nutrients, gently supplementing energy

179
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,959
for the roots and leaves, helping the

180
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,959
plant recover after the resting phase.

181
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,240
Next, pour 500 ml of water over the rice

182
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,240
to soak it.

183
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,760
This is the banana mixture I have

184
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,839
prepared. Bananas provide many minerals

185
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,639
and natural sugars helping the orchid

186
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,639
absorb energy easily.

187
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,519
Next, take 50 ml of the banana mixture

188
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,519
to dilute.

189
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,959
After mixing, let the mixture rest for

190
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,720
about 2 hours for light fermentation.

191
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,399
The fermentation process helps the

192
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,800
nutrients in the rice, banana, and

193
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:45,399
ginger blend and transform into a form

194
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,399
that is easily absorbed by the roots.

195
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,120
After soaking for about 2 hours, stir

196
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,000
the mixture again to ensure the

197
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,000
nutrients are evenly dissolved.

198
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,120
Next, strain out any remaining solids,

199
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,360
keeping only the clear solution. This

200
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,519
makes the watering gentle, prevents

201
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,519
clogging of the medium or young roots,

202
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,160
and ensures the roots fully absorb the

203
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,600
natural nutrients, recovering healthily,

204
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,600
and preparing for the new blooming

205
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,600
season.

206
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,320
Step one, water this natural fertilizer

207
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,160
mixture directly onto the roots and

208
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,480
growing medium about two to three times

209
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,480
per month.

210
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,839
Regular watering helps the roots gently

211
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,360
absorb nutrients, stimulating healthy

212
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:51,200
growth of both roots and leaves.

213
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,760
This is an important step for the plant

214
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,760
to recover quickly, maintain vitality,

215
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,320
and prepare for new flower buds to bloom

216
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,320
in the coming seasons.

217
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,959
The fermented banana and rice water

218
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,680
mixture provides the plant with a full

219
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,440
range of natural nutrients. It not only

220
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,240
supplies minerals and sugars for the

221
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,399
roots to easily absorb energy, but also

222
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:18,600
stimulates root and leaf growth,

223
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,600
enhancing the plant's resistance.

224
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,320
Uh, step two, pour the natural

225
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,320
fertilizer mixture into a spray bottle.

226
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,880
Using a spray bottle helps distribute

227
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,360
the solution evenly over the leaves and

228
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,279
young stems while easily reaching the

229
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,240
nooks and crannies of the plant that

230
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,240
direct watering might miss.

231
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,720
This spraying not only supplies

232
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,959
nutrients but also allows the plant to

233
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,240
absorb them directly through the leaves,

234
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:56,800
enhancing overall health. As a result,

235
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,800
the leaves become lush and vibrant and

236
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,800
the plant is ready to nurture new flower

237
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,279
buds, preparing for a brilliant blooming

238
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,279
season ahead.

239
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,600
Step three, after spraying, use a soft

240
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,600
cloth to blot any water remaining on the

241
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,600
leaves.

242
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,680
This prevents the leaves from holding

243
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,720
water for too long, reducing the risk of

244
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,639
mold or disease on the leaf surface. At

245
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,560
the same time, it helps the nutrients

246
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,720
from the fertilizer solution absorb

247
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,519
evenly into the leaves, nourishing the

248
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,720
orchid and preparing new flower buds to

249
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,639
grow strong.

250
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,720
After completing all the care steps,

251
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,720
place the plant in a spot with gentle

252
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,720
sunlight.

253
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,320
And here are the results after 3 weeks

254
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,480
of dedicated care. You can see the roots

255
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,639
growing strong and healthy, beginning to

256
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,399
spread evenly throughout the growing

257
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,519
medium.

258
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,240
Not only are the roots growing

259
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,240
vigorously, but the plant has also

260
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,480
started producing new vibrant green

261
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,399
leaves. This is a clear sign that the

262
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,959
plant is recovering well, absorbing

263
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:19,160
nutrients efficiently, and storing

264
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,160
energy for the next flower buds.

265
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,079
Uh, I continue to water the plant with a

266
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,560
natural fertilizer made from rice and

267
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:53,959
fermented banana every month about two

268
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,959
to three times.

269
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,280
Maintaining this care routine allows the

270
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,760
roots and leaves to absorb nutrients

271
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,480
consistently, sustaining vitality and

272
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,799
stimulating strong growth. As a result,

273
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,760
the orchid will fully recover with lush

274
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,600
green leaves and be well prepared for

275
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,600
new flower buds to bloom in the next

276
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,600
season.

277
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,679
And here are the results after 3 months

278
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,679
of consistent care.

279
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,960
You can see the orchid growing

280
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:50,760
vigorously in both roots and leaves.

281
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,760
Lush and healthy.

282
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,960
And the special thing is the orchid has

283
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,559
sprouted a new flower spike. This is

284
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,200
clear evidence of the plant's strong

285
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,679
vitality and the effectiveness of caring

286
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,280
with natural fertilizer. The new spike

287
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,600
signals that the orchid is ready for a

288
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:26,679
brilliant blooming season ahead with

289
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,679
fresh, vibrant, and lively flowers.

290
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,799
And here are the results after four

291
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,039
months of consistent care. You can see

292
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,880
the orchid not only avoided exhaustion

293
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,520
after the flowering season, but also

294
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,919
grew vigorously with strong roots and

295
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,919
healthy leaves.

296
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,880
It's wonderful to see the plant

297
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,120
continuing to bloom with vibrant

298
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,039
flowers, showing that care with natural

299
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,000
fertilizer made from rice and fermented

300
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:14,400
banana truly helps the orchid recover,

301
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,760
maintain vitality, and prepare for many

302
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,760
more beautiful blooming seasons ahead.

303
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,240
Seeing the orchid recover and bloom

304
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,240
consistently, you will truly feel the

305
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,640
joy that comes from caring for every

306
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,640
small detail.

307
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,440
Believe that with love and patience, any

308
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,880
orchid can be revived strongly, grow

309
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,640
healthy and beautiful, and bloom

310
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,320
brilliantly.

311
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,240
Every care step you give the plant is

312
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,039
not only nourishment for its roots,

313
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,960
leaves, and flowers, but also a way to

314
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:51,960
sew joy and happiness in your own

315
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,960
garden.
