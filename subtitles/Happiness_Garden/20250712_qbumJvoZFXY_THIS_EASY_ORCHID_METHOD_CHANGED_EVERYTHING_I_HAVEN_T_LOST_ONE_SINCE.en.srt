Welcome to my channel where we share our

3
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,480
passion for orchid care and enjoy the

4
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,920
gentle beauty that nature offers.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,160
You can see this orchid has yellowed

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,599
leaves and a rotting base. Many people

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,480
think it's dead and quickly throw it

8
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,640
away, but the truth might surprise you.

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,040
Now, let's see how I revived this orchid

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,520
that seemed beyond hope. You'll witness

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,760
a miracle born from the simplest things.

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,320
First, I will remove all the yellow

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,719
leaves that have been infected by fungus

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,480
to prevent the disease from spreading

15
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,480
and to help the plant recover more

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,480
easily.

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,160
Next, I will cut off the old withered

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,239
flower spikes along with the rotting

19
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,800
roots so the plant no longer has to

20
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:02,039
waste energy on dead parts and can focus

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,039
on recovering.

[Music]

23
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,439
After that, I will gently remove all the

24
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,520
infected leaf sheets as this is where

25
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,200
fungi and bacteria often hide and

26
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,759
continue to harm the plant if not

27
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,759
treated in time.

30
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,280
country you're watching from. It's

31
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,960
wonderful that we can connect and share

32
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,960
with each other from all around the

33
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,960
world.

34
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,200
To begin the recovery process for the

35
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,360
orchid, I prepare about 20 g of onion, a

36
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,159
familiar kitchen ingredient, but one

37
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,719
that has strong antibacterial properties

38
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,719
and supports the plant's growth from

39
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,719
within.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,039
Then I add about 600 ml of water to

41
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,800
blend with the onion, helping to release

42
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,000
the essential nutrients needed for the

43
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,560
plant's recovery process.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,239
Bulbs and sprouts, especially onions,

45
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,400
contain many essential minerals,

46
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,879
vitamins, and amino acids that play a

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,879
vital role in nourishing the roots,

48
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,840
stimulating growth, and boosting the

49
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,319
plant's resistance.

50
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,640
Then place the orchid into this mixture

51
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,560
and soak it for about 20 minutes so the

52
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,120
nutrients can deeply penetrate the

53
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,120
roots, helping to cleanse pathogens and

54
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,120
stimulate a more effective recovery

55
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,120
process.

56
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,680
After soaking for about 20 minutes, take

57
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,920
the orchid out and hang it in a cool,

58
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,720
airy place to let it dry naturally,

59
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,400
which helps prevent fungal infections

60
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,820
uh and creates the best conditions for

61
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:06,860

reuse a used plastic bottle and turn it

65
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,640

[Music]

75
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,280
I make an extra drainage hole at a fixed

76
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,439
position so that when growing the orchid

77
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,360
in a semi-hydroponic style, the water

78
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,680
level in the pot stays stable and

79
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,159
doesn't rise too high, which could lead

80
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,159
to root rot.

81
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,439
Then I continue to make several small

82
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,079
holes around the sides of the bottle to

83
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,239
ensure the roots stay well ventilated,

84
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:24,120
reduce water stagnation, and help the

85
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,120
plant grow more healthily.

91
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,479
I use crushed pine bark to grow orchids.

92
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,880
It's an ideal growing medium because it

93
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,880
retains moisture well, drains quickly,

94
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,320
and provides a well ventilated

95
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,320

sealed cover like a mini greenhouse.

lightly water the roots and growing

excess onion water to avoid water

both the top and underside of the

170
