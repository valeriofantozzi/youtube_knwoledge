00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,200
Welcome to my garden where you can find

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:07,600
the simplest and most natural orchid

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,519
care tips. Here we explore together how

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,440
to help orchids grow healthy, bloom

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,200
brightly, and bring joy to your home.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,680
However, to help the plant grow quickly,

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,119
and develop a truly healthy root system

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,800
today, I want to share with you a

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,720
completely new type of fertilizer.

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,279
Simple but effective care methods will

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,519
help orchids grow quickly and always be

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,559
vibrant with many beautiful fresh

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,480
flowers. A natural fertilizer easy to

14
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,399
make at home but very effective, helping

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,719
the plant grow strongly from roots to

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,719
leaves.

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,040
Now the flowers will stay fresh longer

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:47,200
on the branch and their colors will

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:49,200
become more vibrant and prominent.

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,879
Let's get started. To start making this

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,800
natural fertilizer, you just need a

22
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,440
clean bottle and a bit of pure coffee

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,680
powder. These simple ingredients will

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,000
provide excellent nutrients for your

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,320
orchid.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Just one spoon of pure coffee powder is

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,410
enough to create a nutrient-rich

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,319
mixture.

29
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:09,319
[Music]

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,880
Next, pour in another 500 ml of boiling

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,040
water to activate the nutrients in the

32
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,920
coffee powder and create an energy

33
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,680
richch fertilizer for your orchid.

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,920
Pure coffee solution contains many

35
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,000
minerals such as potassium, magnesium,

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,479
and antioxidants, which help stimulate

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,880
root growth, make the leaves shiny

38
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:34,159
green, increase resistance, and support

39
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,240
even and longlasting blooming. Close the

40
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:40,759
bottle and let it sit for about 2 hours

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,759
to allow the solution to cool down.

42
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,600
Uh the next ingredient you need to

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,320
prepare is oatmeal, a natural and

44
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,720
healthy source of starch. Oatmeal

45
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,439
contains micronutrients such as iron,

46
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,360
zinc, magnesium, and B vitamins, which

47
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,399
help nourish healthy roots and support

48
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,479
balanced plant growth. Just one spoon of

49
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,320
oatmeal is enough to provide gentle

50
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,479
nutrients that help orchid roots grow

51
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,080
strong while also nourishing beneficial

52
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,479
microbes in the growing medium.

53
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,160
Pour in another 500 ml of boiling water

54
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,160
to activate the oatmeal and release its

55
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,599
nutrients, creating a simple yet

56
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,760
effective orchid fertilizer mixture.

57
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,400
As it breaks down, oatmeal creates a

58
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,400
carbonrich and moist environment, ideal

59
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,280
for microorganisms that help the plant

60
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,680
absorb nutrients more effectively.

61
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,840
Oatmeal has a mild water retaining

62
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,080
ability, helping to maintain moisture

63
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,800
around the the roots, especially useful

64
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,800
when the plant is recovering.

[Music]

66
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,360
Uh after about 2 hours, the coffee

67
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,120
solution has completely cooled.

68
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,519
You can now strain out the grounds to

69
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,920
obtain the nutrient-rich extract ready

70
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,840
to use for your plant.

71
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,080
Coffee water contains micronutrients

72
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,319
such as potassium, magnesium, and a

73
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,239
small amount of nitrogen, helping the

74
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:08,239
plant develop strong roots, green

75
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:10,400
leaves, and long-lasting flowers.

76
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,760
Thanks to natural antioxidants, coffee

77
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,920
water helps boost the plant's

78
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,879
resistance. Especially effective for

79
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,720
weak plants or after repotting.

80
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,879
When used in proper amounts, coffee

81
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,640
water helps maintain a stable pH level

82
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,450
and creates an ideal environment for

83
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:30,239
root development.

87
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,680
absorb nutrients more safely and

88
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,920
effectively.

89
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,680
Um, coffee gently stimulates growth,

90
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,239
helping orchids sprout new shoots and

91
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,560
develop fresh foliage.

92
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,040
The organic acids in coffee can soften

93
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,720
the growing medium, helping roots absorb

94
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,490
minerals more effectively from the

95
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,519

which country you're watching from. It's

108
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,639
truly wonderful that we can connect and

109
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,080
share with each other from all around

110
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:33,160

111
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,160
nature and beautiful orchids.

112
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,919
Orchid leaves have tiny pores on both

113
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,759
surfaces, especially on the underside.

114
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,919
When wiped with the coffee solution,

115
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,600
minerals like potassium and magnesium

116
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,440
are absorbed directly into the leaf

117
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,600
tissue, allowing the plant to take them

118
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:54,240
in faster than through regular watering.

119
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,800
Wiping the leaves helps remove builtup

120
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,520
dust which can hinder the photosynthesis

121
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,759
process. When the leaves are clean, the

122
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,440
plant absorbs light more effectively,

123
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,120
thereby boosting energy production and

124
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,440
supporting more efficient root and

125
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,440
flower development.

natural antioxidants which help make the

leaves shinier and greener when applied.

130
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,880
At the same time, it can help inhibit

some mild fungi on the leaf surface,

132
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,479
keeping the plant clean and healthy.

coffee when applied directly to the

135

unstable growing conditions.

139
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,680
Regularly wiping orchid leaves keeps the

140

stamata on the leaf surface clear and

141
