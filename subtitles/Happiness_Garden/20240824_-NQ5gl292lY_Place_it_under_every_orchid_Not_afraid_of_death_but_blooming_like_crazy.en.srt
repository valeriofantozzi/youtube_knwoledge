00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello friends

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,366
Today I will show you how when we need to water the orchid

3
00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:11,298
When the orchid's roots are green like this, the orchid has enough water

4
00:00:11,298 --> 00:00:17,238
The leaves will be green and sturdy

5
00:00:26,501 --> 00:00:31,366
But if the roots turn white, the plant is lacking water

6
00:00:31,366 --> 00:00:35,303
check the potting medium you will find it very dry

7
00:00:35,303 --> 00:00:41,917
Leaves will wilt very quickly if we don't water them in time

8
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:50,060
In this case, we need to quickly water the orchid

9
00:00:52,901 --> 00:00:56,444
HOW TO WATER AS FOLLOWING:

10
00:00:56,444 --> 00:01:02,994
Place the orchid pot in a deep dish and water the substrate completely

11
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:47,803
If the roots are still fresh but the leaves are wilted, we can soak the orchid in water for 20-30 minutes

12
00:01:56,366 --> 00:02:01,343
With pots using moss growing medium, the ability to retain moisture is very good,

13
00:02:01,343 --> 00:02:05,291
so we only need to water enough moisture.

14
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:09,388
and no need to soak.

15
00:02:13,905 --> 00:02:19,073
Eat bananas, don't throw away the peels

16
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:24,404
Banana peel contains a lot of vitamins and minerals:

17
00:02:24,404 --> 00:02:29,020
vitamins A, B, C, E and protein, phosphorus, especially rich in potassium.

18
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:36,334
Potassium resists drought very well, helps the orchid to transport water from the root to the top, so the orchid does not wilt

19
00:02:36,334 --> 00:02:43,062
At the same time, potassium helps to stimulate flower growth and keep flowers fresh for a long time

20
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:04,439
We cut banana peels

21
00:03:08,683 --> 00:03:14,600
Put all banana peels in a jar and pour 500ml of boiled water

22
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,784
Then incubate for 1 day for the nutrients to dissolve into the water

23
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:46,507
5 vitamin b1 tablets mixed with 500ml of filtered water

24
00:03:46,507 --> 00:03:52,433
B1 helps plants to better absorb nutrients

25
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:56,179
and growth regulator

26
00:03:56,179 --> 00:04:00,888
It also stimulates root growth very well

27
00:04:04,038 --> 00:04:12,649
After 1 day of incubation, we mix banana juice with vitamin B1 water to get 1 liter of synthetic organic fertilizer solution.

28
00:04:36,618 --> 00:04:41,611
Divide into a spray bottle

29
00:04:53,118 --> 00:04:58,108
Spray the top and bottom of the leaves evenly

30
00:04:58,108 --> 00:05:06,763
Orchid plants are provided with a part of nutrients that are supplemented through the leaves

31
00:05:06,763 --> 00:05:15,486
At the same time, it also eliminates insects to help the orchid stay green

32
00:05:22,246 --> 00:05:29,616
You can also use a cotton ball soaked in this synthetic organic fertilizer solution to wipe the leaves

33
00:05:29,616 --> 00:05:37,535
Do this 1-2 times a month, the orchid will always be protected and green

34
00:05:58,147 --> 00:06:05,128
Next, you use this liquid synthetic organic fertilizer solution to irrigate the orchid

35
00:06:05,128 --> 00:06:12,964
do 1-2 times a month and combine with other organic fertilizers that I have shared on the channel

36
00:06:12,964 --> 00:06:21,252
It will help orchids easily absorb nutrients

37
00:06:21,252 --> 00:06:27,026
Vitamin B1 helps stimulate root growth

38
00:06:27,026 --> 00:06:33,489
Potassium in banana juice will stimulate flower growth and help flowers stay fresh for a long time

39
00:06:33,489 --> 00:06:39,574
It is truly the perfect formula for the full development of roots, leaves and flowers

40
00:06:39,574 --> 00:06:46,469
It's very good, but you should not overdo it, it will harm the orchid

41
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:54,170
You should only fertilize according to my instructions so that your orchid garden always blooms without affecting the growth of orchids.

42
00:06:56,774 --> 00:07:04,815

00:08:01,007 --> 00:08:03,007
Welcome to part 2 of the video

48
00:08:03,007 --> 00:08:08,004
When you plant a lot of orchids, 

49
00:08:08,004 --> 00:08:13,003
you will not be able to avoid rotten orchids.

50
00:08:13,003 --> 00:08:21,001
You see my orchid has been infected with a fungus

51
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:34,032
If not handled promptly, this orchid is very easy to die

52
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:52,028
Even though it's rotten, it's still fresh when cut across

53
00:08:55,028 --> 00:09:03,026
It is also a favorable condition for the spread to respawn faster

54
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:15,024
We need to cut off the branches and remove all the rot

55
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:25,922
This will prevent rot from spreading

56
00:09:27,921 --> 00:09:35,920
Then rinse with water

57
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:49,917
Use 300ml of water at room temperature

58
00:09:53,916 --> 00:10:02,914
Mix 1 tablespoon of unsweetened fresh milk into the water

59
00:10:14,912 --> 00:10:21,911
add 1 vitamin B1 tablet

60
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:36,908
Use a cotton ball to absorb the mixture of B1 water and milk

61
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:48,905
Then wipe the top and bottom of the leaves

62
00:10:50,905 --> 00:10:58,903
This water mixture has a disinfecting effect

63
00:10:59,903 --> 00:11:06,902
Helps get rid of fungal diseases

64
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:18,933
Then use this mixture of water B1 and milk to soak the orchid root for 20 minutes

65
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:45,927
The rest is used to spray other normal orchids

66
00:11:46,927 --> 00:11:55,925
Helps get rid of fungal diseases

67
00:11:56,925 --> 00:12:05,923
and supplement necessary nutrients for orchids

68
00:12:11,922 --> 00:12:18,921
After soaking for 20 minutes, take out the branches

69
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:45,915
dry the cut

70
00:12:52,914 --> 00:12:58,913
use toothpaste

71
00:13:01,912 --> 00:13:11,910
Applying it on a cut will help it heal faster

72
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:20,909
will protect orchids from rot

73
00:13:22,908 --> 00:13:28,907
While waiting for it to dry, 

74
00:13:30,907 --> 00:13:39,905
I recycle old plastic containers to make tools to revive orchids

75
00:13:49,903 --> 00:13:59,901
Use industrial cotton to put it in the pot

76
00:14:05,933 --> 00:14:14,931
then let the orchid in

77
00:14:15,931 --> 00:14:25,929
Next, every 3 days, spray moisturizing mist with normal water

78
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:31,928
Then put the orchid pot in a cool place

79
00:14:31,928 --> 00:14:39,926
The most suitable temperature for reviving orchids is from 20-30 degrees Celsius

80
00:14:41,926 --> 00:14:44,925
1 MONTH LATER

81
00:14:49,924 --> 00:14:59,922
The orchid has rooted very well

82
00:15:00,922 --> 00:15:06,921
and grow 1 more young leaf

83
00:15:07,921 --> 00:15:12,920
B1 stimulates rooting very well

84
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:21,918
Milk contains natural calcium to help orchids stay strong 

85
00:15:23,918 --> 00:15:29,916
and increase resistance

86
00:15:42,914 --> 00:15:50,612
Now I grow orchids in pots with moss so that it adapts to the outside environment

87
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:58,877
Note: When the roots are firmly attached to the substrate, fertilize the orchid

88
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:16,874
Welcome to part 3 of the video

89
00:16:16,874 --> 00:16:26,872
There are many flower buds, the flowers stay on the branches longer.

90
00:16:28,871 --> 00:16:38,869
Today I share a very easy way to make orchids always grow healthily.

91
00:16:44,868 --> 00:16:52,900
lush green and flowers will bloom all year round.

92
00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:06,897
Water it once a week.

93
00:17:16,895 --> 00:17:23,894
and leave for 10 minutes.

94
00:17:23,894 --> 00:17:29,893
to help the roots turn green.

95
00:17:32,892 --> 00:17:39,891
then take it out.

96
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:51,888
I use a small teaspoon of cinnamon powder mixed into 1 liter of boiled water.

97
00:17:53,888 --> 00:18:02,886
Cinnamon powder is very good, helping orchids grow very quickly.

98
00:18:04,886 --> 00:18:09,885
Wait for this water to cool.

99
00:18:14,884 --> 00:18:23,882
After the water cools, will filter this water.

100
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:41,878
And I use 1 tablespoon of flour, which contains a lot of nutrients.

101
00:18:44,878 --> 00:18:51,876
Add 1 liter of water.

102
00:18:53,876 --> 00:19:01,874
The nutrients in wheat flour also help plants grow very quickly.

103
00:19:03,874 --> 00:19:10,873
and mix with cinnamon water.

104
00:19:11,872 --> 00:19:18,871
will create a great organic nutrient for orchids.

105
00:19:20,871 --> 00:19:28,869
And water immediately at the base of the tree.

106
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:36,867
You should fertilize orchids every 2 weeks.

107
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:50,898
Use this water to spray on the leaves.

108
00:19:55,897 --> 00:20:03,895
Helps prevent insects such as thrips and mealybugs.

109
00:20:07,895 --> 00:20:16,893
You should do it early in the morning and by noon the leaves will dry very quickly.

110
00:20:19,892 --> 00:20:29,890
Leave it like that for 20 minutes.

111
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:42,888
Wheat always contains many organic nutrients.

112
00:20:47,887 --> 00:20:55,885
Helps orchids grow healthily.

113
00:21:06,883 --> 00:21:14,881
This type of water also helps a lot for weak, underdeveloped plants.

114
00:21:17,881 --> 00:21:27,879
If the orchid has been planted for many years and still hasn't bloomed, repot it.

115
00:21:36,877 --> 00:21:46,875
Cut off damaged roots.

116
00:21:55,873 --> 00:22:05,871
use this water wipe the leaves.

117
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:16,869
Helps leaves recover from fungus.

118
00:22:19,868 --> 00:22:28,900
Cinnamon powder has antibacterial and antiseptic properties and wheat contains a lot of minerals.

119
00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:41,897
and essential vitamins, helping plants recover very quickly.

120
00:22:51,895 --> 00:23:00,894
Adding this amount of water helps new roots grow quickly.

121
00:23:02,893 --> 00:23:07,892
Soak in this water for 20 minutes.

122
00:23:09,892 --> 00:23:13,891
Then take it out.

123
00:23:13,891 --> 00:23:20,890
Place the plant in a bright place.

124
00:23:22,889 --> 00:23:32,887
Helps plants photosynthesize, create chlorophyll, keep leaves green and roots strong.

125
00:23:35,887 --> 00:23:44,885
and the flowers will bloom more beautifully.

126
00:23:53,883 --> 00:24:01,882
Hope it will always help you a lot.
