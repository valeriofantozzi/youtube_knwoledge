crush them into small

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,439
for Lush leaves while eggshells add

calcium to strengthen roots

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,119
the mild acidity of coffee grounds pairs

29
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:43,040
with the alkalinity of eggshells to

30
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:46,040
create a balanced pH suitable for
