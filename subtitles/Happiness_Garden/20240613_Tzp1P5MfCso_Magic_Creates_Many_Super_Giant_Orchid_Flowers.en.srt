00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,401
Today I share a new way,

3
00:00:06,401 --> 00:00:12,630
Helps support the growth of super orchids.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:25,728
Like my orchid.

5
00:00:25,728 --> 00:00:36,714
To have super giant orchids, orchids must be disease-free.

6
00:00:36,714 --> 00:00:45,670
Leaves must be green and free from fungal diseases.

7
00:00:45,670 --> 00:01:00,001
It is the most important way for orchids to photosynthesize and absorb nutrients.

8
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:04,464
When there is enough nutrition, the flower will be very big.

9
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:12,240
THIS IS A MILK WITHOUT SUGAR.

10
00:01:25,501 --> 00:02:00,000
I would use a ratio of 1 part milk to 3 parts water.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:23,753
Use this absorbent cotton and wipe the entire front and back of the leaf,

12
00:02:23,753 --> 00:02:43,550
Fix has very good disinfecting properties,

13
00:02:43,550 --> 00:03:03,215
Will help get rid of fungus and bacteria,

14
00:03:03,215 --> 00:03:20,005
Lan will be safe and protected.

15
00:03:20,005 --> 00:03:42,223
At the same time, milk contains many essential minerals for plants

16
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:57,557
Will indirectly absorb nutrients through orchid leaves.

17
00:03:57,557 --> 00:04:57,230
Do this every 2 weeks for better protection and growth

18
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:05,039
This is an eggshell

19
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:11,360
I dried and ground it

20
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:19,502
Use 1 spoon

21
00:05:19,502 --> 00:05:37,064
Add 200ml of boiled water

22
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:50,061
Close the lid and wait for it to cool

23
00:06:27,989 --> 00:06:36,798
Use 1 teaspoon of honey

24
00:06:46,846 --> 00:06:58,750
Add 2 liters of water

25
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:29,506
Use this water to water every 3 weeks for orchids that are flowering.

26
00:07:29,506 --> 00:07:39,553
Honey contains many vitamins, minerals and natural sugars.

27
00:07:41,543 --> 00:07:56,873
Orchids will easily absorb and make the flowers super big and long lasting.

28
00:08:03,871 --> 00:08:11,870
You see this is a withered orchid.

29
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:22,868
Now let me show you how to revive this orchid.

30
00:08:37,898 --> 00:08:46,896
I use 1 small ginger.

31
00:08:49,896 --> 00:09:00,894
Squeeze out the water to soak the orchid branches in ginger water.

32
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:22,889
Wait for it to dry.

33
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:34,887
Use a molten candle to apply on the cut

34
00:09:34,887 --> 00:09:42,885
Doing so will not allow water to seep inside the orchid,

35
00:09:42,885 --> 00:09:48,884
This will prevent the orchid from rotting and from losing water.

36
00:09:56,882 --> 00:10:06,881
I will recycle it into a miniature greenhouse to revive the orchid.

37
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:46,394
Place the orchid in the moss and mist it to keep it moist.

38
00:11:51,393 --> 00:12:05,390
Put it in a cool place and mist it every 5 days.

39
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:23,387
AFTER 3 WEEKS

40
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:53,614
The little sprout has come back to life.

41
00:13:03,612 --> 00:13:11,611
Continue to keep in a cool place and mist once every 5 days.

42
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:26,608
AFTER 3 MONTHS

43
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:12,632
Lan has successfully revived with extremely strong roots

44
00:14:19,631 --> 00:14:29,629
To prevent the orchid from root rot, I will replant it with pine bark and pumice stone.

45
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:26,617
From now on, water once every 7-10 days to keep moist.

46
00:15:28,617 --> 00:15:38,615
combine using organic fertilizers like I shared on the channel to take care of them,

47
00:15:41,614 --> 00:15:49,613
Will help orchids grow better

48
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:56,611
