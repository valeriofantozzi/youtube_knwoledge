00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:33,894
Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:43,892
This orchid pot has rot disease.

3
00:01:08,253 --> 00:01:16,885
and the leaves also wither.

4
00:01:16,885 --> 00:01:26,883
When leaves wilt, the cause may be due to damaged roots and not absorbing enough water, leading to wilted leaves.

5
00:01:26,883 --> 00:01:36,881
And you see these roots have rotted due to waterlogging.

6
00:01:53,878 --> 00:02:03,876
Cut off all rotten roots.

7
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:36,869
then rinse.

8
00:02:45,626 --> 00:02:55,899
Take 1 clove of garlic.

9
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:19,894
Then puree with 500ml of water.

10
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:46,889
Filter out residue.

11
00:03:48,888 --> 00:03:56,887
Add water to make 2 liters of garlic water.

12
00:04:04,394 --> 00:04:10,884
Step 1: Clean the leaves thoroughly with garlic water.

13
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:26,881
Garlic juice helps eliminate fungal diseases and harmful insects.

14
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:48,877
Step 2: Soak orchid roots in garlic water for 10 minutes.

15
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:10,872
Then take it out and put it in a jar.

16
00:05:11,872 --> 00:05:20,870
Pour in water.

17
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:28,869
Keep the water level at this position.

18
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:43,899
Place on the windowsill or under a sunshade for orchids.

19
00:05:48,898 --> 00:05:51,897
1 WEEK LATER.

20
00:05:51,897 --> 00:05:58,896
Take 1 liter of water.

21
00:06:02,177 --> 00:06:08,894
Take 1 spoon of rice.

22
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:38,888
Soak orchid roots in rice water for 20 minutes.

23
00:06:46,887 --> 00:06:55,885
Then take it out and put it in a jar.

24
00:06:55,885 --> 00:07:05,883
Pour in water.

25
00:07:06,883 --> 00:07:16,881
From now on, soak orchid roots in rice water once a week.

26
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,878
3 weeks later.

27
00:07:33,016 --> 00:07:41,876
Orchid leaves are sturdy and less likely to wilt.

28
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:54,873
New roots grow a lot, helping the orchid quickly recover withered leaves.

29
00:08:10,187 --> 00:08:20,868
I continue to take 1 spoon of rice mixed with rice water to take care of the orchids.

30
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:43,897
Continue soaking orchid roots in rice water once a week.

31
00:08:48,673 --> 00:08:56,894
After 20 minutes, take it out and put it in a jar.

32
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:19,890
3 MONTHS LATER.

33
00:09:26,888 --> 00:09:36,886
So with this simple method, after only 3 months the orchid has recovered and grown very healthy.

34
00:09:38,886 --> 00:09:48,884
Both roots, leaves and flowers grow strongly.

35
00:09:53,883 --> 00:10:02,881
