Welcome to the happiness garden. To

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,480
answer your question, Breaking Cooper,

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,639
today I will share a video titled The

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,200
Best Time to Repot Your Orchid for more

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,759

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,599
how to recognize the ideal time to repot

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:19,119
your orchid, helping the plant grow

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,039
healthy and bloom more. I will guide you

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,359
step by step in a simple way from

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,000
preparing the new pot and growing medium

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,320
to handling the roots and leaves so the

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,840
plant is not damaged. Uh let's follow

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,079
along and discover the tips that keep

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,430
your orchids always vibrant and blooming

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,609

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:43,040
In my opinion, there are three important

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,120
times when we need to repot orchids. And

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,960
here are three specific orchid pots that

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,960
I will show how to handle in today's

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,039
video.

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,600
Each pot has different conditions and

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,920
care needs. So repotting correctly will

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,399
help the plant recover quickly and grow

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,760
healthier. Let's take a look at each pot

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,280
to understand how to care for them and

27
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,480
discover the secrets to keeping your

28
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,480
orchids blooming beautifully.

29
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,960
The first case, we need to repot when

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,960
the growing medium has decomposed and

31
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,720
rotted because at that point, the roots

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,000
cannot absorb enough nutrients and

33
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,759
water. If left too long, the roots will

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,400
continue to be damaged, affecting the

35
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:26,360
overall health of the plant and may even

36
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,360
cause the orchid to die.

[Music]

38
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,600
The second case, we need to repot when

39
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,399
we see too many roots growing out of the

40
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,040
pot. This indicates that the plant has

41
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,040
outgrown its current space and needs

42
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,079
more room for the roots to spread and

43
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,880
absorb nutrients better. If we don't

44
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,399
repot, the roots will be restricted,

45
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,560
making it difficult for the plant to

46
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,200
grow and affecting the number of flowers

47
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,039
in the following seasons.

48
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,040
Repotting at this time gives the plant a

49
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,280
new space for healthy root growth, which

50
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,460
in turn promotes greener leaves and more

51
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,689
abundant flower blooms.

[Music]

54
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,040
The third case, we need to repot when

55
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,239
the plant has grown large, but the old

56
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,680
pot is too small. A small pot restricts

57
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,680
root growth, preventing the plant from

58
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,280
absorbing enough nutrients and water,

59
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,000
directly affecting its health and

60
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,160
flowering ability. Moving the plant to a

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,840
larger pot provides space for the roots

62
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,160
to spread, helping the plant grow

63
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,640
taller, have greener leaves, and produce

64
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,640
more flower buds.

65
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,760
Now I will start repotting each case. I

66
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,840
will go slowly and carefully through

67
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,680
each step because this process is

68
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,239
important and should not be rushed.

69
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,480
This is the case where we repot because

70
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,800
the plant has grown large while the old

71
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:21,159
pot is too small and at the same time

72
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,159
the roots are growing out too much.

73
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,239
First, gently remove the old pot,

74
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,760
avoiding damage to the roots. Then,

75
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,000
carefully check the potting medium

76
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,440
inside. If you see the medium has

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,280
decomposed, rotted, or become compacted,

78
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,790
remove it immediately so the roots can

79
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,910
breathe better.

[Music]

82
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,640
When checking, I found that the potting

83
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,799
medium was still fresh, loose, dry, and

84
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,400
well draining. This shows that the

85
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,879
current growing environment is still

86
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,879
stable, the roots are healthy, and

87
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,120
there's no need to replace the medium

88
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,120
just yet.

89
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,200
Next, we will cut off all the damaged,

90
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,360
rotten, and hollow roots. These these

91
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,840
roots can no longer absorb water or

92
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,599
nutrients, and if left, they can easily

93
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,599
cause fungal infections to the healthy

94
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,599
roots.

[Music]

96
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,000
Next, we gently cut off the wilted

97
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,479
leaves. These leaves can no longer

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,199
photosynthesize and may become a place

99
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,919
for fungus and disease to accumulate if

100
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,840
left for too long. Removing wilted

101
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,160
leaves helps the plant focus its energy

102
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,919
on nourishing the roots and new leaves

103
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,919
while keeping its shape neat and

104
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,919
healthy.

105

[Music]

106
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,880
You can also trim a few aerial roots if

107
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,479
they've grown too long or become tangled

108
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,479
together. This helps the plant look

109
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,639
tidier and allows better air flow around

110
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,639
the base.

111
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,800
However, only trim the roots that are

112
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,240
dry or damaged while keeping the healthy

113
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,160
ones because they still help the plant

114
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,840
absorb moisture and nutrients from the

115
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,680
air.

116
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:30,039
Work carefully and gently to avoid

117
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,039
injuring the healthy roots of the plant.

124
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,000
In the case where the potting medium has

125
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,010
decomposed, you need to remove all of

126
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,100
the old medium.

Handle it very gently to avoid breaking

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,080
or scratching the healthy roots.

130
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,800
Then continue cutting off all the

131
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,560
damaged, rotten or dried black roots.

132
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,880
These roots can no longer absorb water

133
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,479
and nutrients, and if kept, they can

134
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,479
make the plant more susceptible to

135
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,479
disease.

136
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,680
After removing all the old potting

137
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,160
medium, you should let the plant rest in

138
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,820
a dry, well ventilated place while

139
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:55,720
waiting to move on to the next step.

[Music]

141
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,960
In this case, the moss layer in the

142
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,440
potting medium has almost completely

143
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,960
collapsed, leaving only the bark. So,

144
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,960
the plant is lacking sufficient medium.

145
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,960
You don't need to replace the entire

146
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,120
pot. Just trim off the damaged or dried

147
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,080
roots. Then, add a bit of fresh potting

148
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,919
medium to fill the missing part. This

149
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,919
helps retain moisture better and creates

150
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,480
a stable environment for new roots to

151
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:27,120
grow strong and healthy.

[Music]

153
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,440
Uh next we will prepare a mixture that

154
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,599
both disinfects the roots and the

155
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,919
potting medium and helps stimulate new

156
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,919
root growth.

157
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,039
The first ingredient we need is vitamin

158
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,800
B1 in 2.5 mg tablets. Just three tablets

159
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:49,160
are enough to prepare one batch for

160
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,160
soaking the roots and potting medium.

161
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,280
The next ingredient is a small aloe vera

162
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,360
leaf. Aloe vera contains many natural

163
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,199
vitamins and minerals, has antibacterial

164
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,199
properties, and helps soothe cuts on the

165
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,199
roots.

166
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,000
The final ingredient is ginger. Ginger

167
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,919
has strong natural antibacterial and

168
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,560
antifungal properties that help prevent

169
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,039
root rot and mold in the potting medium

170
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,440
after repotting. You only need about 10

171
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,440
g of ginger.

ingredients are completely combined.

176
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,600
After blending, you need to strain out

177

Diluting it makes the solution gentler,

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,800
This solution will help eliminate any

192
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:31,399
remaining bacteria and mold while

193
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,399
stimulating the growth of new root tips.

194
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,519
Soak for about 20 minutes to allow the

195
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,600
nutrients to penetrate deeply into the

196
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:53,240
roots and take effect in disinfecting

197
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,240
and restoring them.

198
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,240
For this weak orchid, I will soak the

199
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,079
entire plant in the mixture to ensure

200
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,640
all the roots and the stem are evenly

201
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,560
restored. Soaking the whole plant allows

202
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,560
the nutrients to penetrate deeply,

203
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,600
supports rapid new root growth, and

204
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,600
boosts the plant's resistance.

222
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,240
the leaves, stem, and aerial roots of

223
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,240
the plant.

224
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,320
Spraying directly like this helps the

225
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,720
plant quickly absorb nutrients through

226
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,480
the leaves and aerial roots while also

227
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,800
lightly disinfecting the entire surface

228
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,800
of the plant.

229
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,760
Doing this regularly in this way will

230
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,000
help the plant become healthier with

231
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,000
glossy green leaves and strong root

235
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,079
After soaking for about 20 minutes, take

236
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,399
the orchid pot out and let it drain for

237
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:51,800
about 30 minutes before planting it into

238
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,800
the new pot.

240
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,279
Uh once the plant has drained, we

241
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,880
proceed to plant it in the new pot. You

242
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,360
should choose a pot with good drainage

243
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:43,160
to prevent root rot and that fits the

244
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,160
current size of the orchid.

245
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:00,379
[Music]

246
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,240
Uh, the potting medium I chose is

247
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,399
shredded pine bark, which has been

248
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,040
soaked in disinfected water and drained

249
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,279
beforehand. Pine bark helps the roots

250
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:19,199
get good air flow, drains well, and

251
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:21,519
reduces mold growth in the pot.

252
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,440
When planting, gently add the pine bark

253
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,079
around the roots, making sure they are

254
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,399
not bent or compressed. A proper and

255
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,720
clean potting medium is crucial for the

256
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:35,079
plant to recover quickly, grow strong

257
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,079
roots, and have healthy green leaves.

258
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,399
After planting, place the orchid pot in

259
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,800
a cool, airy spot for about 3 to 7 days

260
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,279
without watering. This allows the roots

261
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,680
and any cuts on the plant time to

262
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,759
recover, reduces the risk of rot or

263
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,560
fungal infection, and helps the plant

264
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,560
adjust to its new environment.

[Music]

266
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,560
After the 3 to 7day resting period, you

267
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:08,440
can start lightly watering and caring

268
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,440
for the plant. As usual,

269
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,279
light watering helps the new roots

270
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,360
gradually adapt to the potting medium

271
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:21,079
while providing enough moisture without

272
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,079
causing water logging.

273
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,600
For about 3 weeks after repotting, you

274
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,519
don't need to fertilize the plant

275
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,040
because before planting, we soaked the

276
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,360
roots and potting medium in a

277
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,440
nutrient-rich solution. The nutrients

278
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,690
have already penetrated deeply into the

279
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,949
roots and medium.

[Music]

281
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,959
During this time, the orchid will focus

282
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,880
on recovering its roots and adapting to

283
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,759
the new environment, so additional

284
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,519
nutrients are not yet needed.

285
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,279
To ensure healthy growth, just monitor

286
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:59,720
the leaves, roots, and moisture of the

287
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,720
potting medium and avoid overwatering.

288
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,919
After watering, remember to place the

289
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,000
orchid pot in a spot with gentle

290
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,240
sunlight for photosynthesis.

291
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,520
Avoid direct harsh sunlight as it can

292
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,360
burn or wilt the leaves quickly. A cool,

293
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,199
airy location with adequate light will

294
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,439
help the orchid grow healthy and bloom

295
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,439
more beautifully.

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,919
since repotting.

[Music]

300
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,480
You can see that the orchid has started

301
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:49,280
to grow new roots, which shows that the

302
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,280
recovery process is going very well.

303
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,440
Healthy new roots help the plant absorb

304
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,440
water and nutrients more efficiently

305
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,720
while providing a strong foundation for

306
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,480
green leaves and upcoming flower buds.

307
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,799
This is clear evidence that proper

308
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,760
repotting and careful care bring results

309
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,760
right from the early stages.

310
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,880
And when the orchid has new roots, that

311
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,280
is also the time we need to fertilize

312
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,200
the plant. Fertilizing at this stage

313
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:31,799
provides enough nutrients for the new

314
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,799
roots to grow strong and healthy.

[Music]

316
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,760
Healthy roots help the plant absorb

317
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,679
water and nutrients more effectively,

318
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,450
thereby promoting vibrant green leaves

319
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:49,439
and fully developed flower buds.

[Music]

321
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,679
Now I will fertilize the orchid using

322
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:57,679
the prepared rice water. Rice water

323
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,679
contains many natural vitamins and

324
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,919
minerals helping the orchid roots grow

325
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,919
strong and the leaves stay green and

326
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,919
healthy.

327
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,640
Water evenly around the base and roots

328
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,480
of the plant so the nutrients can

329
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,039
penetrate deeply into the roots and

330
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,880
potting medium. This natural method is

331
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,200
both safe and effective, helping the

332
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:29,240
orchid recover quickly and prepare for

333
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,240
beautiful clusters of blooms.

334
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,720
Apply rice water fertilizer two to three

335
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,960
times a month. This frequency is enough

336
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,640
to provide continuous nutrients keeping

337
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,840
the roots and leaves healthy without

338
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,840

Or you can also alternate with other

341
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,360
types of natural fertilizers to provide

342
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,520
the plant with complete nutrients.

343
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,160
Natural fertilizers like egg fertilizer,

344
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,160
banana fertilizer, or fruit mixtures all

345
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,400
help the roots grow strong, the leaves

346
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,400
stay green, and the flower buds develop

347
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,400
better.

348
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,600
Regularly changing the nutrient sources

349
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
helps the plant absorb a variety of

350
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:36,760
minerals, boosts its resistance, and

351
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,760
