00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:03,900
welcome to my channel

2
00:00:06,004 --> 00:00:11,898
If you want to take care of orchids at home to stay healthy

3
00:00:12,653 --> 00:00:18,897
and blooms many flowers, the flowers cling to the branches for a long time before fading

4
00:00:18,897 --> 00:00:22,896
Watch this video until the end

5
00:00:25,895 --> 00:00:30,894
First I took 3 spoons of rice

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,025
Add 1 liter of water and wait 10 minutes for the nutrients to dissolve in the water

7
00:00:53,890 --> 00:01:00,888
When I eat bell peppers, I keep a piece to use as fertilizer for the orchids

8
00:01:02,888 --> 00:01:09,887
Bell peppers contain many vitamins and minerals such as vitamin C, A, and potassium. 

9
00:01:09,887 --> 00:01:16,885
These substances help improve orchid growth by providing micronutrients that make the plant healthier.

10
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,879
Add 300ml of water

11
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:10,875
puree

12
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:36,869
Filter residue

13
00:02:59,898 --> 00:03:06,897
Add 1 liter of water at room temperature

14
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:14,228
After soaking for 10 minutes, I filtered this water

15
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:23,670
Rice water contains carbohydrates, proteins, B vitamins and minerals such as iron, phosphorus and potassium. 

16
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:32,603
These nutrients help plants grow healthy and stimulate root growth.

17
00:03:34,891 --> 00:03:40,890
Then mix the rice water with bell pepper water

18
00:03:56,887 --> 00:04:00,886
Use soft cotton to absorb this water

19
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:08,884
Then wipe the leaves thoroughly

20
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:19,882
Helps eliminate fungal diseases and leaf-damaging insects

21
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:32,880
The leaf surface will always be clean

22
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:43,877
The leaf surface will always be clean and the stomata will not be clogged.

23
00:04:46,877 --> 00:04:52,876
Orchids will photosynthesize better.

24
00:05:00,874 --> 00:05:06,873
You need to thoroughly clean the underside of the leaves

25
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:15,871
Because the underside of leaves is where bacteria, fungi 

26
00:05:15,871 --> 00:05:20,870
and insects often reside to harm orchids

27
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:32,868
Doing this 1-2 times a month will help protect orchid leaves

28
00:05:38,335 --> 00:05:43,899
Leaves will always be green

29
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:56,896
Insects such as red spiders, leafhoppers, aphids, and thrips will not survive on orchids

30
00:06:08,894 --> 00:06:16,892
Beneficial microorganisms in rice water also protect leaves from fungal diseases

31
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:33,889
Orchid leaves are always strong and plump

32
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:15,881
Method 2

33
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,879
Water the orchid roots with this water

34
00:07:26,878 --> 00:07:32,877
Thanks to nutrients such as phosphorus and B vitamins, 

35
00:07:32,877 --> 00:07:39,876
Rice water can help orchids develop stronger roots, helping the plants absorb nutrients from the soil better.

36
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:48,874
Potassium in bell peppers plays an important role in stimulating the flowering process 

37
00:07:48,874 --> 00:07:52,873
and making orchids grow stronger.

38
00:07:56,873 --> 00:08:03,871
Antioxidants in bell peppers, especially vitamin C, 

39
00:08:03,871 --> 00:08:11,870
It also helps protect plants from attacks by environmental factors and diseases.

40
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:23,867
Using rice water regularly helps improve beneficial microorganisms in the soil,

41
00:08:23,867 --> 00:08:30,899
Create a better living environment for orchids. 

42
00:08:34,898 --> 00:08:40,897
This also helps maintain soil moisture, 

43
00:08:40,897 --> 00:08:48,896
which is helpful in keeping the plant from drying out.

44
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:55,894
Apply once every 2 weeks

45
00:09:02,893 --> 00:09:08,892
Pour this water into a spray bottle

46
00:09:45,884 --> 00:09:48,884
Method 3

47
00:09:50,714 --> 00:09:57,882
Spray this water on orchids every 2 weeks

48
00:10:01,881 --> 00:10:08,880
Spray both the top and bottom of the leaves

49
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:20,877
This method is similar to using foliar fertilizer.

50
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:33,581
The nutrients in rice water stimulate the plant to produce more flowers 

51
00:10:34,664 --> 00:10:42,663
and last longer, helping the plant become more lush and beautiful.

52
00:10:48,097 --> 00:10:57,095
Beneficial organic compounds in bell peppers contribute to enhancing plant resistance to pests and harsh environments.

53
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,899
Result

54
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:30,897
When you regularly apply this method, the leaves will always be green and strong

55
00:11:33,896 --> 00:11:42,894
These nutrients help plants grow healthy and stimulate root growth.

56
00:11:48,893 --> 00:11:58,891
A strong root system will help the orchid easily absorb the most nutrients

57
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:11,555
You can see that the roots of these orchids are very healthy

58
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:10,877
Potassium in rice water and bell peppers helps flowers bloom brilliantly

59
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:21,875
and stays on the branches for a long time before fading

60
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:33,872
Can be kept on branches for up to 6 months before fading

61
00:13:34,872 --> 00:13:42,871
Hope it will help you a lot in taking care of orchids at home

62
00:13:42,871 --> 00:13:48,869
Thank you for watching the video. Wishing you luck and success in life.

63
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:52,869
Goodbye and see you again in the next videos.
