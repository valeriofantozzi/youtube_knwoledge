Welcome to Happiness Garden, where every

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,040
leaf and every petal tells us a gentle

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,200
story of love for nature and care from

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,200
the heart.

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,759
Let's discover together the wonders that

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,920
come from the smallest things in this

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,920
garden.

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,760
After buying an orchid and enjoying its

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,480
blooms, the plant often starts to

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,119
decline. Yellowing leaves, weak roots,

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,119
and a tired look.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,480
Sadly, many people throw it away too

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,430
soon, not knowing there's still a strong

14
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,680
life force inside waiting to be revived.

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,840
Many orchids here have been discarded

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,840
wastefully.

19
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,920
This orchid, although weakened, still

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,559
has fresh green leaves, a sign that it's

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,800
alive. So, I decided to take it home to

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,840
care for and revive it, hoping to bring

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,840
it back to full strength.

[Music]

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,439
We need to gently remove the old growing

26
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,920
medium, which may hold dust and

27
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,360
bacteria, and repot the orchid into a

28
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,000
new container to give it a better

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,000
environment to grow.

30
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,799
This helps the roots breathe and absorb

31
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,840
nutrients and water more effectively,

32
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,840

After removing all the old growing

35
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,040
medium, we trim away all the damaged

36
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,960
roots, those that are rotten or no

37
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,960

38
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,960
nutrients.

39
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,640
This helps the plant focus its energy on

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,400
growing new healthy roots, increasing

41
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,520

52
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,680
Next, we remove the wilted and yellow

53
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,440
leaves as they no longer perform

54
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,840

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,840
harmful bacteria.

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,000
This keeps the plant clean and allows it

59
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,959
Next, we rinse the entire orchid

60
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,519
thoroughly with clean water to remove

61
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:33,799

This step creates a clean environment,

reduces the risk of infection, and helps

66
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,670
the plant absorb nutrients more

00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,040
Next, I sterilize the moss used as the

orchid growing medium.

71
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,799
This step is crucial to eliminate

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,720
bacteria, mold, and harmful agents that

73
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,080

76
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,199
I soak the moss in hot water to

The natural potassium content in the

195
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,800

196
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:07,399
petals last longer, potentially keeping

197
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,399

239
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,760
After planting, we prepare natural

240
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,760
fertilizer to care for the orchid.

241
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,519
To make natural fertilizer, I take I

take 1 tbsp of wheat flour diluted in

243
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,160
one liter of water.

244
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,639
This mixture provides gentle nutrients

245
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,720
and helps stimulate beneficial

246
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,240
microorganisms in the growing medium,

247
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,800
contributing to the orchid's health

250
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,880
After mixing, strain out the sediment so

251
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,639
the solution becomes clear and can

252
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,800
penetrate the growing medium and roots

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,800

most effectively without clogging or

harming the orchid.

257
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,399
Then apply this fertilizer twice a month

258
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,720
to provide consistent nut nutrients for

259
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,560
the orchid.

260
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,800
Regular feeding helps the plant grow

261
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,560

262
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,560

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:33,960
Wipe thoroughly on both the top and

386
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,960
bottom surfaces of the leaves.

387
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,440
Uh, wiping the leaves helps remove dust

388
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:47,880
and enhances photosynthesis, allowing

389
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,880
the plant to absorb light better.

390
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,960
Uh, the combination of tobacco and

391
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,360
banana helps stimulate the plant's

392
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:05,000
natural immune system, helping to fight

393
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,000
diseases and insects.

395
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:23,320
A wiping provides some micronutrients

396
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,320
and can support plant health.

Doing this one to two times a month will

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,760
be very good for your orchid.

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,480
method three.

401
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,559
Um, if you have a large number of orchid

402
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,600
pots, you can put the solution into a

403
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:20,600
spray bottle and spray the entire orchid

404
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,600
plants.

405
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,640
Spray thoroughly on both the top and

406
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,640
bottom sides of the leaves.

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,600
orchid growing medium.

410
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,960
This method is similar to using folure

411
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,960
fertilizer and base watering,

412
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,559
but you should not spray it on the

413
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,559

415
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,870
Because when flowers get wet, they tend

416
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:46,900
to wilt and drop their petals.

419
00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:00,080
After soaking for 20 minutes, uh, take

420
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,080
the orchid pot out and place it in a

421
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:05,799
spot with plenty of diffused light so

422
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,799
the orchid can photosynthesize.

I continue to recycle the banana peel

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,440
and tobacco ashes into fertilizer for

426
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,440

Close

435
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,520
the bottle and place it in a cool place.

436
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,679
After 3 weeks, you will have GE

even the weakest orchid species has
