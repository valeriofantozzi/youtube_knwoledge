00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,999
Welcome to my channel

2
00:00:03,238 --> 00:00:08,285
In this video I will show you how to take care of orchids that have died and bloomed again

3
00:00:08,688 --> 00:00:14,746
In my hand is a flower branch that has fallen, only the branch remains

4
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:19,040
Let these flowers grow and bloom again

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:34,816
need to cut off the places that have bloomed

6
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:41,074
Just for the places where it can thrive like this

7
00:00:41,269 --> 00:00:54,314
and peel off the membrane for easy flower growth

8
00:00:56,245 --> 00:01:03,667
This cut is left to dry naturally. You should not water until the cut is not dry

9
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:11,739
This is a sprouted potato

10
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:23,291
Potato sprouts contain a lot of AUXIN which is a plant growth stimulant

11
00:01:28,848 --> 00:01:33,323
Add 20 grams of fresh ginger

12
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:42,556
Add 0,6 liter of water at room temperature

13
00:01:48,164 --> 00:01:53,912
puree it all

14
00:02:01,273 --> 00:02:08,059
Filter out residue

15
00:02:09,232 --> 00:02:15,606
Add 0.6 liters of water at room temperature

16
00:02:17,724 --> 00:02:21,078
first use

17
00:02:21,078 --> 00:02:27,358
Soak cotton balls in potato germ water

18
00:02:32,123 --> 00:03:30,778
clamp where sprouts can grow

19
00:03:40,032 --> 00:03:59,008
7 days do it again with potato sprout water 1 time

20
00:04:09,092 --> 00:04:12,133
2nd way

21
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:20,651
Pour potato juice into a spray bottle

22
00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:41,152
Spray evenly on leaves, roots, roots and surface of orchid growing medium, but do not spray on flowers

23
00:04:41,601 --> 00:04:46,367
Potato sprouts contain many important nutrients for plants such as:

24
00:04:46,497 --> 00:04:51,263
Potato sprouts contain high amounts of protein,

25
00:04:51,263 --> 00:04:57,564
This is one of the important factors needed for plant growth.

26
00:04:57,884 --> 00:05:05,488
The natural potassium content in potato sprouts is an essential nutrient for the growth of plants,

27
00:05:05,488 --> 00:05:07,974
helping to enhance resistance,

28
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:13,082
resistant to a number of diseases and helps plants resist adverse environmental influences.

29
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:16,229
3rd way

30
00:05:16,989 --> 00:05:26,592
Water evenly on the roots, roots and surface of the substrate

31
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:34,439
Potato sprouts also contain phosphorus,

32
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:42,000
an important nutrient that promotes root growth,

33
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:50,141
play an important role in plant growth.

34
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:59,175
Calcium in potato sprouts is also very abundant, which is an essential nutrient for the growth of plant cells

35
00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:05,624
plays an important role in creating strong cellular structures,

36
00:06:05,624 --> 00:06:15,000
while helping to improve the pH of the soil and increase the plant's ability to absorb other nutrients.

37
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,296
Potato sprouts also contain mage

38
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:24,904
Magnesium is an important nutrient that helps balance pH,

39
00:06:24,904 --> 00:06:30,730
increase the absorption capacity of plants

40
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:35,484
Apply misting method or root watering once a month

41
00:06:36,161 --> 00:06:44,238
Results after more than 1 month stimulate flowering for faded flowers

42
00:07:13,156 --> 00:07:23,890
This way is very many Hoa used by this way

43
00:08:11,462 --> 00:08:13,462
Care results with potato sprout juice

44
00:08:15,087 --> 00:08:24,693
Orchids bloom many flowers at once

45
00:08:24,693 --> 00:08:29,477
and bloom long on flower branches

46
00:08:29,477 --> 00:08:36,379
can last up to 3 months

47
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:44,040
The leaves are very thick and sturdy

48
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:59,658
Roots grow very big and strong
