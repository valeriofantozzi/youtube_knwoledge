48
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,799
for the Orchid stem we need to make a

49
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:16,440
clean cut to avoid crushing it which

50
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,440
will reduce the risk of rot from the cut

51
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,319
these rotting leaves should be removed

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,330
and kept far from the garden to prevent

53
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:40,539
