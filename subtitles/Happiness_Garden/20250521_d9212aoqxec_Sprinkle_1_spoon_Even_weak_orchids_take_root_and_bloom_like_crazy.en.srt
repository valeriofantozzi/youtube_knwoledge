00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,680
Welcome to the happiness

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:07,520
garden. In this video, I continue to

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,679
share a new method for making organic

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,830
fertilizer for orchids. It helps orchids

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:16,460
grow comprehensively and bloom

00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,460
[Music]

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,760
abundantly. Let's get started.

00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:27,119
[Music]

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,119
To make this fertilizer, I need

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,120
tobacco. Only one cigarette is

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,770
[Music]

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,559
enough. Tobacco contains nicotine, which

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,940
has antifungal effects, helping protect

14
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,800
plants from some fungal diseases.

15
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:54,960
[Music]

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,879
Nicotine has insecttoidal effects. It

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,130
can cause suffocation or paralysis in

18
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:04,840
insects upon

19
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:07,520
[Music]

20
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,439
contact. The smell of tobacco makes some

21
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,520
insects like aphids and thris avoid

22
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:15,920
coming near the plant.

23
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,759

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,680
Leave a comment to let me know which

25
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,200
country you're watching the video from.

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,930
It's wonderful that we can chat with

27
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,759

31
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,400

32
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,400
water.

[Music]

34
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,640
Next, we need a

35
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,439
banana. Any type of banana can be used

36
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,439
to make natural

[Music]

38
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:11,239
fertilizer. Take one ripe banana and cut

39
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,239
it into thin slices.

00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,639
[Music]

41
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,239
Bananas are rich in potassium and

42
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,640
phosphorus, which are important

43
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:29,220
nutrients that help orchids grow well,

44
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:32,379
bloom, root, and increase resistance.

[Music]

48
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,560
Then soak the banana in the previously

49
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,560
prepared tobacco water.

50
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,189
[Music]

51
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,080
Then close the lid, let it sit, and wait

52
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,080
for the water to

53
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:29,640
cool. After 2 hours, the water has

54
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,640
cooled.

57
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,949
Strain this water.

method

63
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:49,600
one. When the roots turn silvery white

64
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,560
like this, water the orchid with this

65
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,560
liquid fertilizer solution.

66
00:04:54,650 --> 00:05:05,360
[Music]

67
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,919
Bananas also provide organic matter and

68
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,360
enzymes that help improve soil fertility

69
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,360
and the growth of beneficial

70
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,360
microorganisms.

[Music]

72
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,520
Uh, the tobacco soaking water has

73
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,520
antifungal properties and repels

74
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,630
insects, helping protect the plant roots

75
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,990
from

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,120
diseases. Water the orchid with this

78
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,919
liquid fertilizer one, two, two times

79
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,919
per month.

80
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,400
or combine it with other organic

81
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,400
fertilizers as I have shared on the

82
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,400
channel.

83
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,360
Your orchid will absorb more

84
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,239
[Music]

85
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,280
nutrients. Soak the orchid pot in this

86
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,440
water for about 20 minutes so the roots

87
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,560
can absorb more nutrients and be

88
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,560
protected from fungal diseases.

89
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,400
Method

90
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:51,600
two, use a soft cotton ball to soak up

91
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,960
this liquid fertilizer solution. Then

92
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,960
gently wipe it onto the

93
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,880
leaves. Wipe thoroughly on both the top

94
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,880
and bottom surfaces of the leaves.

95
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,360
Uh, wiping the leaves helps remove dust

96
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,800
and enhances photosynthesis, allowing

97
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,800
the plant to absorb light

98
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,880
better. Uh, the combination of tobacco

99
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,280
and banana helps stimulate the plant's

100
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,919
natural immune system, helping to fight

101
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,919
diseases and insects.

[Music]

103
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:55,240
A wiping provides some micronutrients

104
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,240
and can support plant health.

[Music]

106
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:12,680
Doing this one to two times a month will

107
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,680
be very good for your orchid.

108
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,399
Method three,

109
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,480
um, if you have a large number of orchid

110
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,519
pots, you can put the solution into a

111
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,519
spray bottle and spray the entire orchid

112
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,519
plants.

113
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,560
Spray thoroughly on both the top and

114
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,560
bottom sides of the leaves.

115
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:15,799
[Music]

116
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,519
Spray on the aerial roots and on the

117
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,519
orchid growing

118
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,880
medium. This method is similar to using

119
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,880
folure fertilizer and base

120
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:49,200
watering, but you should not spray it on

121
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,200
the flowers.

122
00:09:55,310 --> 00:10:03,349
[Music]

123
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,780
Because when flowers get wet, they tend

124
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:18,840
to wilt and drop their petals.

[Music]

127
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,000
After soaking for 20 minutes, uh, take

128
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,000
the orchid pot out and place it in a

129
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,720
spot with plenty of diffused light so

130
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,720
the orchid can photosynthesize.

[Music]

132
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,040
I continue to recycle the banana peel

133
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,360
and tobacco ashes into fertilizer for

134
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,360
the next

136
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:20,880

[Music]

138
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:29,739
Then add one teaspoon of yeast.

Close the bottle and place it in a cool

143

159
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,160
