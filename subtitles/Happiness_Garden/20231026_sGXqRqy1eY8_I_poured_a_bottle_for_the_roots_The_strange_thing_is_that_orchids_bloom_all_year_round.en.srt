And share so more people know this good tip.

9
00:01:35,882 --> 00:01:45,880
I cut the peel of an orange and put it in a jar.

10
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:58,877
Add 2 liters of warm water.

11
00:01:59,877 --> 00:02:09,875
Then add 1 spoon of sugar and 1 spoon of yeast.

12
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:38,869
Punch holes in the lid, close the lid and leave in a cool place for 1 month.

13
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,899
1 MONTH LATER.

14
00:03:00,186 --> 00:03:10,896
I already have GE orange peel fertilizer.

15
00:03:12,394 --> 00:03:22,894
I took 4 tablespoons of GE orange peel.

16
00:03:34,065 --> 00:03:41,890
mix 2 liters of water.

17
00:03:43,206 --> 00:03:47,889
FIRST METHOD.

18
00:03:49,705 --> 00:03:59,886
Use a GE orange peel to thoroughly wipe the top and bottom of the leaf.

19
00:04:02,652 --> 00:04:12,884
Orange peels contain essential oils that after incubation will help repel insects very effectively

20
00:04:24,272 --> 00:04:34,879
Helps leaves photosynthesize and create chlorophyll better.

21
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:50,876
Do this 1-2 times a month to protect orchids and keep the leaves green.

22
00:04:59,005 --> 00:05:02,874
SECOND METHOD.

23
00:05:06,297 --> 00:05:16,871
Applying this fertilizer to the roots 1-2 times per month helps provide organic substances such as:

24
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:26,869
humic acid, fulvic acid and enhance water retention in orchid growing media.

25
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:45,899
Orange peel also contains many important minerals such as potassium, magnesium, calcium and trace elements.

26
00:05:51,041 --> 00:06:01,895
GE fertilizer helps orchids grow strongly and increase flower production.

27
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:16,893
GE fertilizer helps improve the ability of plants to absorb nutrients, 

28
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:26,891
helping orchids make better use of available nutrients in the environment.

29
00:06:36,448 --> 00:06:40,888
RESULT.

30
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:53,885
The flower color is more vibrant than usual.

31
00:07:01,386 --> 00:07:11,882
Orchids bloom many flowers on the same tree but do not fall.

32
00:07:15,814 --> 00:07:26,879
Flowers bloom continuously from season to season all year round.

33
00:07:32,144 --> 00:07:42,875
The flowers stay on the branches for a long time before fading.

34
00:07:52,251 --> 00:08:00,872
