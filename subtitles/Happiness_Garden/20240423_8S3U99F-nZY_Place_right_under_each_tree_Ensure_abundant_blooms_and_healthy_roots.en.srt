Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:10,898
When orchids have enough nutrients and a good soil environment,

3
00:00:10,898 --> 00:00:16,897
The plant will grow strongly and flower more.

4
00:00:16,897 --> 00:00:25,895
In this video, I share a type of fertilizer that few people know about.

5
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:31,894
Come explore with me now.

6
00:00:33,528 --> 00:00:41,526
When you grow many orchids, it is inevitable that orchids will rot.

7
00:00:43,212 --> 00:00:51,190
If it accidentally rots, you need to immediately cut off the rotten part.

8
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:59,189
Then isolate the rotten orchid pot from other normal orchid pots.

9
00:01:02,227 --> 00:01:10,220
This helps prevent rot from spreading to normal orchids.

10
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:43,180
Then cut off all damaged roots.

11
00:02:01,252 --> 00:02:07,242
This is charcoal

12
00:02:26,556 --> 00:02:36,536
and grind into powder.

13
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:10,796
Then sprinkle activated charcoal powder on the newly cut wound.

14
00:03:12,231 --> 00:03:20,228
Helps cuts heal faster and eliminates fungal diseases.

15
00:03:21,654 --> 00:03:29,626
Because activated carbon has a very good disinfection function.

16
00:03:31,686 --> 00:03:39,657
Then you sprinkle more on the orchid root.

17
00:03:52,688 --> 00:04:00,020
Then place the orchid pot in a cool place and do not water for 1 week and the orchid will recover.

18
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,008
Next way.

19
00:04:04,104 --> 00:04:12,078
Mix 3 tablespoons of activated carbon with 2 liters of water.

20
00:04:47,177 --> 00:04:55,175
Then use this water to water the orchid roots.

21
00:04:58,195 --> 00:05:06,173
Do this periodically every 2 weeks for normal orchids.

22
00:05:08,615 --> 00:05:16,604
Helps prevent disease and improve pH in growing media.

23
00:05:18,038 --> 00:05:26,036
Activated carbon also contains high levels of calcium and natural minerals that are very good for orchids.

24
00:05:26,036 --> 00:05:30,869
Helps stimulate rooting.

25
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:41,366
Soak the orchid pot in this water for 20 minutes.

26
00:05:44,968 --> 00:05:52,964
After 20 minutes, take out the orchid pot.

27
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:20,858
Then filter to get clear water.

28
00:06:41,754 --> 00:06:50,752
Next method: Use this water to thoroughly wipe the top and bottom of the leaves

29
00:06:54,866 --> 00:07:02,850
The orchid will be protected from fungi and insects.

30
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:16,147
The calcium content in activated carbon helps make leaves strong.

31
00:07:42,784 --> 00:07:52,774
Do this regularly every 2 weeks and you will be as healthy as this.

32
00:08:18,877 --> 00:08:26,900
Next method: You can also use this water to spray the entire orchid plant.

33
00:08:32,836 --> 00:08:40,831
Helps eliminate fungi and insects on leaves very well.

34
00:08:44,652 --> 00:08:52,628
and it also provides some nutrients through its leaves and roots very effectively

35
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:16,390
Now let's see the results.

36
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:23,984
Many new roots grow.

37
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:40,056
Helps orchids absorb nutrients best.

38
00:09:47,734 --> 00:09:55,732
The potassium and phosphorus content in activated carbon stimulates plants to root extremely quickly.

39
00:10:11,395 --> 00:10:19,378
Many flower buds grow on the same tree.

40
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:30,942
The potassium content in charcoal helps prevent flower buds from falling off

41
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:49,838
The flowers are brighter and stronger.

42
00:11:23,454 --> 00:11:30,430
Surely you will be surprised with this type of fertilizer.

43
00:11:34,905 --> 00:11:40,895
If you find it interesting, please like and share it with many people.
