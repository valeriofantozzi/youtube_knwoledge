Hello everyone, to easily care for orchids to always grow healthily.

2
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:15,897
There are more flower buds and flowers stay on the branches longer.

3
00:00:15,897 --> 00:00:23,896
Today I share a very easy way to keep orchids growing healthy.

4
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:36,593
I took a small aloe vera leaf and cut it into thin slices

5
00:00:36,593 --> 00:00:42,192
Aloe vera contains many nutrients,

6
00:00:42,192 --> 00:00:50,291
Very good for the growth of buds, flowers, roots and leaves

7
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:57,422
Aloe vera gel also has very good anti-drought effects

8
00:01:03,173 --> 00:01:10,886
I cut aloe vera leaves thinly and put them in a jar.

9
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:30,882
Next I took a piece of bread.

10
00:01:31,882 --> 00:01:40,881
Bread contains phosphorus, which plays an important role in plant growth, especially stimulating root growth.

11
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:13,874
Adding 1 teaspoon of yeast helps decompose organic matter faster and prevents it from rotting.

12
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:26,871
And adding a spoonful of sugar helps nourish the growth of beneficial microorganisms.

13
00:02:37,173 --> 00:02:44,868
Add 500ml warm water.

14
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:07,897
Then leave in a cool place for 3 weeks.

15
00:03:15,075 --> 00:03:17,895
3 weeks later.

16
00:03:19,217 --> 00:03:29,192
Take 2-3 liters of water.

17
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:38,890
After 3 weeks of composting, we have this wonderful fertilizer.

18
00:03:40,578 --> 00:03:43,889
Take 50ml.

19
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:56,887
then mix into water.

20
00:04:04,336 --> 00:04:10,318
Method 1: Apply fertilizer to the roots.

21
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:19,573
Water each orchid pot with this water 10 spoons per week.

22
00:04:34,005 --> 00:04:41,983
This fertilizer provides natural potassium, phosphorus and nitrogen which are important minerals that help improve plant health and vitality.

23
00:04:54,606 --> 00:05:03,600
This type of fertilizer also helps retain water and enhances the plant's ability to absorb water.

24
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:34,746
The beneficial fungus Mycorrhiza will grow to help the plant more easily absorb nutrients from the orchid growing medium.

25
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:28,554
Method 2.

26
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:35,522
Use this water to spray on the leaves.

27
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:43,887
Helps supplement nutrients through leaves very effectively.

28
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:53,885
Helps orchid leaves become strong and healthy.

29
00:06:55,253 --> 00:07:03,250
and sprayed on aerial roots to help aerial roots grow and easily absorb nutrients in the air.

30
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:15,927
You should do it early in the morning and by noon the leaves will dry very quickly.

31
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:28,784
Do this once a week to keep the orchid healthy.

32
00:07:41,876 --> 00:07:45,875
Method 3:

33
00:07:48,731 --> 00:07:55,873
Now I wash the leaves with this water.

34
00:07:59,343 --> 00:08:07,871
Beneficial microorganisms will help kill mold and insects very effectively.

35
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:20,868
Do this every 2 weeks to protect your orchids.

36
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:35,898
Result

37
00:08:37,314 --> 00:08:45,296
After fertilizing, the orchid will always be green and healthy.

38
00:08:56,109 --> 00:09:03,093
Potassium and phosphorus found in aloe vera leaves and breadfruit help flower buds grow strongly.

39
00:09:15,897 --> 00:09:23,889
When the flowers bloom, they will stay on the branches for a long time.

40
00:09:30,221 --> 00:09:38,219
Flowers can last on branches for up to 6 months before fading.

41
00:09:41,063 --> 00:09:48,884
Hopefully the video will help you a lot in taking better care of orchids at home.

42
00:09:53,264 --> 00:10:00,881
Thanks for watching. Good luck and see you in the next video
