orchids by spraying both the top and

589

away dirt and eliminate insects on your

591

for orchids once every 2 to 3 weeks.

967
01:32:14,239 --> 01:32:20,159
Banana peel is rich in potassium,

968
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:23,520
phosphorus, and essential vitamins.

969
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:25,600
Will promote the growth of orchid roots.

970
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:29,440
In particular, the potassium in banana

971
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:32,630
peels stimulates flowering very well.

[Music]

973
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:37,360
In addition, you need to combine using

974
01:32:35,199 --> 01:32:40,239
other organic fertilizers for orchids

975
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:44,199
like manure made from soybeans, peas,

976
01:32:40,239 --> 01:32:44,199
fish poop as I shared.

989
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:29,520
In addition to the English voiceover, we

990

Now, let's get started.

999
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:56,440
To make this type of organic fertilizer,

1000
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:56,440
you need black tea or tea grounds.

1002
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:08,960
I use 3 teaspoons of black tea.

1003
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:19,719
Add one liter of boiled water.

ability to increase the pH level in

1043
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:48,119

insects and fungi that are harmful to

1050
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:20,840

[Music]

1057
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:24,010
