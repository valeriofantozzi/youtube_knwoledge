00:00:21,191 --> 00:00:26,739
Welcome to my channel

2
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:33,376
Today I continue to share a new organic fertilizer to help stimulate flowering for orchids.

3
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:39,325
It is made from part of the red beetroot.

4
00:00:39,613 --> 00:00:45,150
It is really a great fertilizer for flower growth

5
00:00:45,821 --> 00:00:53,394
Using this fertilizer will always have beautiful orchids,

6
00:00:54,066 --> 00:01:02,206
Your garden always blooms,

7
00:01:02,877 --> 00:01:12,291
Each orchid will bloom again and again many times a year

8
00:01:15,895 --> 00:01:17,895
STEP 1

9
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,750
This is red beetroot

10
00:01:22,204 --> 00:01:28,519
Eat beets, do not rush to throw away the skin

11
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:33,814
Beetroot contains many minerals

12
00:01:33,814 --> 00:01:39,596
vitamins like B1, B6, B12

13
00:01:39,596 --> 00:01:46,866
They are essential nutrients important for orchid growth

14
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,521
Use the peel of 1 red beetroot

15
00:01:52,521 --> 00:02:02,419
This young shoot will contain many plant stimulants called AUXIN

16
00:02:02,419 --> 00:02:08,216
will stimulate the budding of plants and flower buds.

17
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:16,449
Add 1 liter of water

18
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:54,385
Closed

19
00:02:58,006 --> 00:03:09,212
Leave in a cool and dark place for 6 hours

20
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:21,719
AFTER 6 HOURS

21
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:49,704
Add water to get 4 liters

22
00:03:56,267 --> 00:04:01,911
Now water the orchid with this water

23
00:04:01,911 --> 00:04:07,722
Red radish is rich in natural potassium,

24
00:04:07,722 --> 00:04:16,111
so orchids are easier to absorb than chemical potassium and safe

25
00:04:16,782 --> 00:04:23,892
Potassium helps balance water and ions,

26
00:04:24,947 --> 00:04:33,419
Potassium also controls stomatal activity,

27
00:04:34,378 --> 00:04:43,776
prevent excessive water loss in dry conditions,

28
00:04:43,776 --> 00:05:01,000
Therefore, potassium is one of the essential macronutrients provided to plants during the maturation and flowering stages,

29
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:09,075
Same goes for orchids,

30
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:20,035
So, if you want orchids to have flowers, pay attention to fertilizing with high potassium content,

31
00:05:20,035 --> 00:05:30,000
Do this once a month for your orchid to bloom

32
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:45,478
Note that you should not apply too much potassium because if you apply too much potassium, the orchid will have atrophy of its roots, small and bad leaves.

33
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:56,306
Applying this fertilizer once a month is enough.

34
00:05:57,163 --> 00:05:59,163
STEP 2

35
00:06:01,806 --> 00:06:13,299
Use 1/3 teaspoon of baking soda

36
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,830
add 1 liter of water

37
00:06:26,275 --> 00:06:31,727
use cotton balls

38
00:06:33,036 --> 00:06:57,763
Wipe the top and bottom of the orchid leaves with baking soda salt water,

39
00:06:57,763 --> 00:07:09,025
Baking soda is a very good disinfectant,

40
00:07:09,503 --> 00:07:16,585
Please clean the orchid leaves once a month,

41
00:07:17,176 --> 00:07:26,100
it helps to remove dirt on the leaves,

42
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:34,826
and kill fungi and bacteria on orchids,

43
00:07:34,826 --> 00:07:40,276
and also kill insects such as aphids, aphids, mosquitoes... clinging to orchids,

44
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:46,508
Helps protect orchid leaves always beautiful shine,

45
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:52,873
Orchid leaves photosynthesize better,

46
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:59,005
When the orchid is healthy, it will always bloom with many beautiful and long-lasting flowers

47
00:08:00,853 --> 00:08:06,871
Welcome to part 2 of the video

48
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:39,897
When orchids are old and have poor resistance, we need to rejuvenate them.

49
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:58,894
First you need to cut off all damaged leaves and roots.

50
00:09:53,883 --> 00:09:58,882
Keep only fresh roots.

51
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:20,877
Onions have very good antiseptic and growth stimulating effects

52
00:10:50,871 --> 00:11:00,869
Take about 20 grams of thinly sliced ​​onion.

53
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:13,900
Take 1 teaspoon of baking soda.

54
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:20,899
Helps balance PH levels and eliminate fungal diseases harmful to orchids

55
00:11:23,898 --> 00:11:33,896
Add 2 liters of water at room temperature.

56
00:11:40,895 --> 00:11:45,894
Wait 30 minutes before using

57
00:11:52,892 --> 00:12:02,890
After 30 minutes, filter to remove residue

58
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:41,883
Then water the orchid with onion water and baking soda

59
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:23,874
Soak in this water for 30 minutes

60
00:13:54,868 --> 00:14:04,900
Cover the pot with a layer of dry moss

61
00:14:19,897 --> 00:14:29,895
Place the dried moss in this transparent plastic box

62
00:14:43,892 --> 00:14:52,890
Leave in a cool place for 1 day without watering

63
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:01,888
1 Day later

64
00:15:03,888 --> 00:15:13,886
From now on, water your orchids once a week

65
00:15:17,885 --> 00:15:25,884
Or water when the moss is dry

66
00:15:32,882 --> 00:15:42,880
Be careful to keep the moss moist. If the moss is waterlogged, the orchid will easily rot.

67
00:15:52,878 --> 00:16:02,876
Then place it in a cool place with enough light for the orchid to grow

68
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:16,873
3 Weeks Later

69
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:06,897
Many baby orchids have sprouted

70
00:17:25,893 --> 00:17:30,892
Take 2 liters of water at room temperature

71
00:17:34,891 --> 00:17:44,889
Then add 5 spoons of rice

72
00:18:03,886 --> 00:18:13,884
Water the orchid with rice water once a week

73
00:18:15,883 --> 00:18:25,881
Helps stimulate baby orchids to grow and take root quickly

74
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:42,878
Continue to place in a cool, well-lit place for the orchid to grow

75
00:18:52,876 --> 00:18:56,875
After the next 1 month

76
00:19:03,874 --> 00:19:13,872
The baby orchids grow very healthy.

77
00:19:18,871 --> 00:19:28,869
