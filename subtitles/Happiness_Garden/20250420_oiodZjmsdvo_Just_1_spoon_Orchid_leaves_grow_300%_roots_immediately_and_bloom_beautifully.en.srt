00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,920
Welcome to my

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:07,600
garden. Uh here I share orchid care tips

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,720
to help your plants stay healthy, grow

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,720
strong roots, and bloom

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,160
beautifully. In the process of growing

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,560
orchids over the years, it's inevitable

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,439
that plants may suffer from rot,

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,680
especially during the summer. This is a

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,920
common issue when humidity is high and

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,960
temperatures are hot, which can easily

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,880
damage your orchids.

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,360
You can see that this orchid is severely

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,960
affected by rot. If not addressed in

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,559
time, the rot can spread quickly

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,559
throughout the garden, damaging other

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,440
plants. Rot often occurs due to several

17
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,039
factors, primarily overwatering,

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,039
especially when the soil doesn't drain

19
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,680
well. This creates an environment for

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:57,480
bacteria and fungi to thrive, damaging

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,480
the plant's soft tissues.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,920
Uh when an orchid is affected by rot, we

23
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,320
need to immediately remove it from the

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,080
garden to prevent spreading. Then trim

25
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,720
off all the damaged leaves to stop the

26
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,720
disease from

27
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,680

33
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,880
Next, we check the roots and the growing

34
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,880
medium. If the roots are rotten, we need

35
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,799
to trim off the damaged parts and

36
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,320
replace the growing medium to ensure the

37
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,320
plant has a healthy environment to

38
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,520
thrive. Next, we check the roots and the

39
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,439

50
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,560
I proceed to trim off all the damaged

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,560
roots.

52
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,800
The growing medium being too moist is

53
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,560
also a cause of the disease. So I need

54
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,280
to remove it and replace it with a

55
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,640
fresher, more breathable medium. This

56
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,599
will help the orchid roots drain

57
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,599
properly and grow healthily.

After removing the old growing medium,

69
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,159
We rinse the orchid under running water

70
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,760
to remove any dirt and bacteria,

71
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,760
ensuring the plant is clean before

72
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,760
replanting.

73
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,479
After washing the plant, we continue to

74
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,000
trim off any remaining damaged roots to

75
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,039
prevent the plant from getting infected

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,039
and to help it grow healthier.

81
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,880
Here you can see that the soft tissue of

82
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,560
the stem has completely rotted making it

83
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,759
very difficult for nutrients to be

84
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,680
transported from the roots upward. If

85
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,039
left as is and replanted, the plant will

86
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,039
gradually weaken and grow more

87
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:35,599
slowly. So, I decided to cut across here

88
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,280
to separate the base and the upper part

89
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:41,560
of the stem, giving the plant a chance

90
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,560
to recover and grow back.

91
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,560
Then take about 5 L of

92
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,400
water.

93
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:28,400
Here is baking soda, which is great for

94
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,840
disinfecting orchids affected by rot. It

95
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,319
helps kill bacteria and prevents the

96
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,319
disease from

97
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,719
recurring. Take 3 tesp of baking soda

98
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,399
and mix it with the 5 L of water from

99
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:49,080
earlier to create an effective

100
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,080
disinfecting solution for the orchid.

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,760
Next, soak both the base and the upper

103
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,080
part of the stem in the diluted baking

104
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,640
soda solution for about 10 minutes. This

105
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,760
helps disinfect and prevent bacteria,

106
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,760

cloth to blot off any excess water from

111
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,040

helps reduce the risk of infection.

126
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,560
I sprinkle cinnamon powder on the cuts

127
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,560

130
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,560
Next, pour 1.5 L of water into a

131
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,160

132
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,360
that will help stimulate the orchid's

133
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,360
growth during its recovery

134
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,240
phase. Next, I use vitamin B1, which

135
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,680
helps stimulate root growth, boost the

136
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,399

137
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,399
recovery after damage.

138
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,240
Take five vitamin B1 tablets and

139
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,760
dissolve them in the water, helping to

143
00:13:56,199 --> 00:14:00,880
Here is honey, which is excellent for

144
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,720
providing nutrients to the plant,

145
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,360

greenhouse, helping the orchid recover

205
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,880
Next, plant the orchid into a new pot

206
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,640
with well- draining growing medium to

207
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,880
give the plant enough space to grow and

208
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,880
prevent rotting.

growing medium for the orchids in my

212
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,480
garden because it drains well, maintains

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,440
stable moisture, and provides good air

223
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,240
grow. After planting, leave the orchid

224
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,159
overnight without watering to help the

225
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,400
plant settle in and reduce the risk of

226
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,400
root rot.

227
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,760
After one night, water the orchid with

228
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,600
the mixture of vitamin B1 and honey to

229
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,000
stimulate root growth and help the plant

230
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,000
recover

231
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,240
quickly. From now on, water the plant

232
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,720
with this mixture once a week to

233
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,559
maintain nutrients, support healthy

234
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,720
growth, and promote stable root

235
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,480
development.

236
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,120
Normally, if the growing medium looks

237
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,520
dry, just mist it with water to provide

238
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:21,840
enough humidity without causing root

239
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:24,080
rot. After that, place the orchid pot in

240
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,240
a spot with gentle sunlight and wait for

241
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,280
the plant to recover under ideal light

242
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,280

00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,640

244
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,120
the results after 1 month of the

245
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,120
orchid's recovery.

246
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,000
You can see that the base stem has

247
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,840
developed many roots which proves that

248
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,480
the plant has recovered well and is

249
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,480
starting to grow again.

250
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,600
The new healthy roots show that the

251
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:29,720
orchid is absorbing enough nutrients and

252
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,720
water from the surrounding environment.

253
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,679
With proper care, the orchid shows

254
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:02,200
strong signs of regeneration and will

255
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,200
continue to grow well in the future.

256
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,520
With the base, you can see that the

257
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,039
orchid has regenerated a new chute in

258
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:27,240
indicating that the plant has recovered

259
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,240
and is starting to grow more vigorously.

260
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,400
Now I will plant the upper part of the

261
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,159
stem into a new pot so that the plant

262
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,559
can grow better in the outside

263
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:09,440

264
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,440

as a support to stabilize the orchid,

268
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,960
preventing the new roots from being

269
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,360
damaged after being planted in the new

270
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,360

maintain moisture, protect the roots,

274
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:01,159

secure the orchid to keep it stable so

279
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,440
the new roots won't be disturbed or

280
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:45,559
