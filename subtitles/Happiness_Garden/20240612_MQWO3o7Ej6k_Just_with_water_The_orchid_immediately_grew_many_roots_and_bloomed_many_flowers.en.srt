Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:03,034 --> 00:00:14,851
Today I share how to propagate and stimulate roots for orchids easily.

3
00:00:45,614 --> 00:01:02,231
Blot the cut dry

4
00:01:02,231 --> 00:01:47,396
Light a candle and apply it on the cut so the water doesn't get in.

5
00:01:47,396 --> 00:01:54,133
That way the orchid will not rot.

6
00:02:49,172 --> 00:02:58,477
Take 1 small piece of ginger

7
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:22,834
Store in a place with daylight and take care not to expose to direct sunlight.

8
00:05:26,901 --> 00:05:41,753
After 3 weeks

9
00:06:34,866 --> 00:06:42,649
after 3 months

Next, I show you how to revive a rotten orchid like this.

12
00:07:55,934 --> 00:08:02,871
When the orchid has withered all the leaves, only the stem and roots remain, do not rush to throw it away.

13
00:08:32,633 --> 00:08:37,631
Here are still fresh roots.

14
00:08:42,548 --> 00:08:50,529
First, cut off all damaged, rotten roots.

15
00:09:18,894 --> 00:09:26,888
Apply a molten candle on the cut so that the water does not penetrate the tree.

16
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:11,379
Use 2 teaspoons of cinnamon powder.

17
00:10:27,386 --> 00:10:35,374
Add 1 liter of boiled water.

18
00:10:52,987 --> 00:11:00,969
Close the lid and wait for the water to cool.

19
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:15,533
The water has cooled down

20
00:11:17,659 --> 00:11:25,631
Filter out residue.

21
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:09,889
Soak orchids in this water for 30 minutes.

22
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:28,085
The rest of the water I will spray on other orchids to help protect the orchid from insects and fungal diseases

23
00:12:59,757 --> 00:13:06,744
After soaking for 30 minutes, plant it.

24
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:27,007
Using pine bark and dry pumice stone to plant will help absorb moisture in the roots, making the orchid roots not rot.

25
00:13:29,465 --> 00:13:35,439
Add some dry moss on the face.

26
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:41,751
Put in a cool and well-lit place for 7 days

27
00:13:41,751 --> 00:13:48,736
After 7 days, you can spray water to keep the plants moist.

28
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:05,233
Cover with a clear, vented plastic container and wait for the plant to revive.

29
00:14:09,222 --> 00:14:15,197
AFTER 3 WEEKS,

30
00:14:16,084 --> 00:14:21,063
A sprout has sprouted,

31
00:14:23,258 --> 00:14:30,228
Spray water once every 5 days to keep the sprouts moist

32
00:14:36,128 --> 00:14:40,126
AFTER 2 MONTHS

33
00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:52,157
