00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:08,899
Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:42,325
After the orchids have withered away

3
00:00:44,423 --> 00:00:54,390
Cut off all flower stems and take care of them so that they continue to revive and bloom.

4
00:01:05,378 --> 00:01:16,352
At this time, it is necessary to take care of the roots so that they can develop and absorb nutrients best.

5
00:01:30,456 --> 00:01:40,447
Use 2 thin slices of onion.

6
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:52,459
Helps stimulate root and flower development very effectively.

7
00:02:11,857 --> 00:02:18,840
Add 2 liters of water at room temperature.

8
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:36,203
Add 5 tablespoons of rice.

9
00:02:42,335 --> 00:02:52,366
Leave for 1 day before using

10
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,931
1 Day Later

11
00:03:27,257 --> 00:03:37,224
Method one: Clean the leaves with this water

12
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:51,821
This water helps stimulate growth and eliminate fungal diseases and leaf-damaging insects

13
00:03:56,393 --> 00:04:06,385
Helps leaves synthesize and create more chlorophyll.

14
00:04:13,884 --> 00:04:22,882
The leaves will always be green and sturdy, increasing their resistance to pests.

15
00:04:25,407 --> 00:04:35,379
Method 2: This water net for plant roots

16
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:50,943
Doing this once a week helps stimulate root and flower growth.

17
00:04:51,943 --> 00:05:03,707
Rice water creates beneficial microorganisms that help protect roots from fungal diseases very effectively

18
00:05:14,877 --> 00:05:24,869
Method 3: Spray this water on the entire orchid

19
00:05:31,177 --> 00:05:41,200
Doing this once a week helps eliminate fungus and insects that harm orchids.

20
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:51,797
At the same time, supplement nutrients through leaves and roots for orchids

21
00:05:53,416 --> 00:06:03,395
After only 1 month the roots have grown a lot

22
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:15,759
Roots help orchids absorb the most nutrients.

23
00:06:18,725 --> 00:06:28,890
Old orchids will recover quickly and synthesize nutrients for the next blooming season.

24
00:06:32,723 --> 00:06:42,721
and after 2 months the orchid begins to produce buds for the next flower crop.

25
00:06:58,955 --> 00:07:08,949
and after 3 months the orchids began to bloom

26
00:07:26,076 --> 00:07:36,044
With this simple method, orchids will bloom continuously from season to season.

27
00:07:38,043 --> 00:07:48,074
and your garden will always bloom with colorful flowers

28
00:07:59,984 --> 00:08:06,871
Hello friends.

29
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:25,900
Orchids thrive in the right light and humidity conditions.

30
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:32,899
You should not put the orchid in a place where there is direct sunlight, it will make the orchid yellow.

31
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:42,897
Mist once every 7 days to create moisture for orchids to grow

32
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:46,896
There are many different ways to care for orchids to grow

33
00:08:46,896 --> 00:08:56,894
Today I share a liquid natural fertilizer made from garlic

34
00:08:56,894 --> 00:09:02,893
I use 3 cloves of garlic

35
00:09:27,888 --> 00:09:33,887
Pour 1 liter of water in

36
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:58,882
I left it in a place without light for a day

37
00:09:58,882 --> 00:10:12,879
After 1 day, I take this garlic water to water my orchids

38
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:41,873
I water each orchid 10 tablespoons

39
00:10:41,873 --> 00:10:50,872
Garlic juice has the effect of repelling insects and protecting the roots of orchids

40
00:10:50,873 --> 00:10:57,870
And provides nutrients for orchids such as: Vitamins

41
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:04,869
Minerals, calcium, potassium, phosphorus and magnesium

42
00:11:04,869 --> 00:11:15,900
Help orchids to be protected and developed

43
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:24,898
Do this once a week to protect and grow the orchid

44
00:11:24,898 --> 00:11:40,895
When fully provided with nutrients: Calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, orchids will bloom and last long.

45
00:11:40,895 --> 00:11:52,893
To protect the leaves, I use 1 tablespoon of water mixed with 2 tablespoons of filtered water.

46
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:15,888
Fresh milk helps protect orchid leaves from fungi and bacteria

47
00:12:15,888 --> 00:12:19,887
And clean the dirt on the leaves

48
00:12:19,887 --> 00:12:25,886
You see this leaf clinging to a lot of dust

49
00:12:25,886 --> 00:12:32,885
When there is a lot of dust, the surface of orchid leaves is not ventilated.

50
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:37,884
stomata blocked by dust

51
00:12:37,884 --> 00:12:42,883
Orchid will have difficulty in photosynthesis

52
00:12:42,883 --> 00:12:53,881
After wiping, the stomata are ventilated

53
00:12:53,881 --> 00:13:03,879
Orchids will photosynthesize well, the leaves will be green again.

54
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:11,877
Do this every 2 weeks to protect and promote orchid growth

55
00:13:11,877 --> 00:13:18,876
