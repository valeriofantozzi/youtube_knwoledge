Welcome to my Happiness Garden channel.

2
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:51,900
In my hand is a phalaenopsis orchid with bacterial rot.

3
00:01:04,678 --> 00:01:23,868
First I need to check the roots for damage.

4
00:01:33,813 --> 00:01:44,013
So this orchid is completely root damaged.

5
00:01:51,238 --> 00:02:18,623
All damaged roots need to be removed.

6
00:03:39,855 --> 00:03:54,509
Rinse with water.

7
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:14,870
Take 100ml of boiled water and let it cool.

8
00:04:19,663 --> 00:04:24,826
Take 1 teaspoon of dried garlic powder.

9
00:04:39,535 --> 00:04:47,313
Soak the orchid root in garlic water for 30 minutes.

10
00:04:50,891 --> 00:05:00,874
In the meantime I recycle this foam sheet into a tool to revive orchids.

11
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:48,734
Pour filtered water into the tank.

12
00:07:59,305 --> 00:08:10,434
then put the orchid in a cool place.

13
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:22,834
and change the water when the water is dirty.

14
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:43,934
3 WEEKS AFTER.

15
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:56,428
orchids have taken root in the water.

16
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:20,156
In this way, the orchid's roots grow very quickly.

17
00:09:44,842 --> 00:09:54,600

19
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:36,141
Now I plant in pots so that the orchids grow in the outside environment.

20
00:10:47,855 --> 00:11:08,478
Orchid growing medium I choose aquaponic medium and a little moss to keep the surface moist.

21
00:11:16,297 --> 00:11:26,265

Goodbye and see you in the next videos.
