Hello everyone. I'm very happy to

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,960
welcome you to the channel today. I hope

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,480
the sharing here will inspire you.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,559
Today I will share a method to help

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,639
orchids quickly recover when affected by

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,639
soft rot caused by insects or harmful

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,639
fungi.

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,199
With just simple ingredients readily

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,279
available in every household kitchen, we

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,720
can easily revive and help a rotting

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,480
orchid quickly grow back. and then the

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,480
flowers will bloom brightly again,

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,320
continuing to shine in your beautiful

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,960
garden.

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,960
Let's get started.

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,239
Um, for orchids that have rotted like

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,239
this, don't rush to throw them away.

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,239
You can see this orchid is suffering

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,920
from soft rot, which may be caused by

20
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,520
insect bites followed by fungal

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,039
infection, or it could also be due to

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,200
the environment, making the orchid prone

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,200
to disease.

24
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,509
[Music]

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,520
Soft rot develops very quickly in hot

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,280
and humid climates. If not treated

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,640
promptly, the disease can spread widely

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,640
and cause the orchid to rot completely.

29
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,560
We need to quickly separate the orchid

30
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,479
with soft rot from the garden and

31
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,230
immediately remove the rotted part to

32
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:38,449
prevent the disease from spreading.

33
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:38,449
[Music]

34
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,680
After that, we need to check the roots

35
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,320
and the growing medium to see if they

36
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,360
are still airy and clean so the plant

37
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,360
has better conditions to recover.

38
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,320
When checking, I see the growing medium

39
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,290
is still clean and airy, so there is no

40
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,469
need to replace it immediately.

41
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,469
[Music]

42
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,879
You can see that many roots are still

43
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,720
healthy and growing well, giving the

44
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,720
plant a better chance to recover faster.

45
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,120
You can trim the old and weak roots to

46
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,890
help the plant focus nutrients on the

47
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:30,639
healthier roots.

48
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:30,639
[Music]

49
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:39,160
Having many healthy roots will help the

50
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,160
orchid recover quickly after soft rot.

[Music]

52
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,400
You can see this orchid is being

53
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,030
attacked by insects, leaving wounds on

54
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,760
the leaves.

55
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,280
[Music]

56
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,879
We need to remove the insects

57
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,720
immediately because they are one of the

58
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,720
main causes of soft rot disease on

59
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,720
orchids.

60
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,000
Insect bites on the leaves combined with

61
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,760
hot and humid weather create favorable

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,760
conditions for fungal infections to

63
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,760
invade, causing soft rot on the orchid.

64
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,000
And now we will make natural fertilizer

65
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,000
together to help the orchid recover

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
faster.

67
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,280
The first ingredient I choose to make

68
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,519
natural fertilizer is garlic because

69
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,080
garlic has strong antibacterial and

70
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:50,840
antifungal properties helping protect

71
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,840
the orchid from harmful agents.

72
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,560
Take two cloves of garlic and slice them

73
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,720
thinly to easily release the

74
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,720
antibacterial essences when soaking the

75
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,720
fertilizer.

Is there a lot of garlic where you live?

78
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,519
I'd love to know. Please leave a comment

79
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,519

wonderful that we can chat together from

85
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,600
After putting the sliced garlic into a

86
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,080
jar, pour one liter of room temperature

87
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,080
water to soak.

88
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,320
Cover the jar and let it sit for a few

89
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,880
hours so the essences from the garlic

90
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,880
can fully release.

100
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,960
To help the orchid recover quickly, I

101
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,199
add vitamin B1 because it stimulates

102
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,199
root growth and increases the plant's

103
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,199
resistance.

104
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,400
Add three vitamin B1 tablets to enhance

105
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,800
root stimulation and help the orchid

106
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,800
recover faster.

119
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,720

196
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,440
After wiping off the water droplets on

197
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,040
the leaves, place the orchid pot in a

198
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,959
spot with gentle sunlight to help the

199
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,550
plant photosynthesize better and enhance

200
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:27,040
its recovery.

[Music]

202
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,560
Uh, you should choose pots with good

203
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,800
drainage holes or create additional

204
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,880
drainage holes for the orchid pot,

205
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,720
helping water not to accumulate,

206
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,959
preventing root rot, and keeping the

207
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,959
plant healthy.

210
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,519
After soaking for 20 minutes, take the

211
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,200
orchid out and replant it into a new,

212
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,519
more ventilated pot to help the roots

213
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,519
grow better.

214
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,240
With moss as the growing medium that

215
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,560
retains moisture well, uh you should

216
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,079
only water again after 2 to 3 weeks or

217
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,880
when you see the medium starting to dry

218
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,880
to avoid root rot.

219
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,920
If your orchid is planted in a well-

220
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,920
draining medium such as pine bark or

221
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,600
pummus, you should base your watering

222
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,000
schedule on the moisture level of the

223
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,560
medium to avoid overwatering that can

224
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,560
cause root rot.

225
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,200
And here is the result. After 1 month of

226
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,279
recovery, the orchid has visibly revived

227
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,760
with larger new leaves and the rot spots

228
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,760
have dried up.

230
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,519
You can see that the rot spots on the

231
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,839
orchid have completely dried, proving

232
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:24,600
that this natural fertilizer is very

233
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,600
effective in treating soft rot disease.

And you can also see the new roots

237
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,199
growing vigorously, which proves that

238
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,240
the orchid is recovering well and

239
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:09,080
absorbing nutrients effectively.

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:26,880

242
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,959
Uh, these new roots help the orchid

243
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,360
increase its ability to absorb water and

244
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,800
nutrients, thereby promoting overall

245
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,800
growth and enhancing the plant's

246
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,800
resistance.

247
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,160

248

gradually have a vibrant garden filled

255
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,050
