Welcome to the Happiness Garden, where

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,480
we explore the beauty of nature together

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,000
and find joy in every moment of plant

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,920
care. If you love orchids and wish to

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,719
propagate and care for your orchids so

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,400
they grow strong, lush, and bloom all

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,000
year round, then this is the video for

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,680

orchid growing tips. It's truly

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,920
wonderful to have you along on this

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,280
journey. Let's get

14
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,920
started. This is an orchid that has

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,000
finished blooming and I bought it at a

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,520
very low price to restore, propagate,

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,520
and help it bloom again in future

18
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,360
seasons. After orchids finish blooming,

19
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,280
they usually have been through quite a

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,000
long period, so we need to carefully

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,220
check their roots and repot them to help

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,480
the plant grow healthier.

23
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,000
[Music]

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,239
Uh you can see that because the orchid

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,719
pot has been used for a long time, mold

26
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:06,159
has appeared on the growing medium which

27
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,159
negatively affects the plant's

28
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:12,479
[Music]

29
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,159
growth. If this situation is left

30
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,400
untreated for too long, it will cause

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,480
root rot and weaken the orchid, even

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:24,400
risking the plant's death.

33
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:27,040
[Music]

34
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,520
uh we need to remove all the moldy

35
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,119
growing medium and replace it with fresh

36
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,450
clean medium to provide the best

37
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,599
conditions for root

39
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,280
growth. Um next we will cut away all the

40
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,560
damaged roots to prevent disease spread

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,560
and help the plant recover faster.

[Music]

45
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,640
The spots where the flower buds have

46
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:27,239
bloomed cannot bloom again and will not

47
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,239
develop into kiki baby plants.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,840
Uh, these two nodes haven't bloomed yet,

49
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:38,000
so we can stimulate them to grow into

50
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,000
Kiki baby plants or produce new flower

51
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:49,280
buds. Um, that's why I cut off the spent

52
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,120
flower nodes so the nutrients won't be

53
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,120
scattered and can focus on supporting

54
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,120
the potential growth of Kiki baby

55
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,120
plants.

56
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,920
Next, I prepare a natural fertilizer to

57
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,840
help restore the orchid and stimulate

58
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,319
the growth of Kiki Kiki baby plants on

59
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,319
the orchid

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,640
cutting. Take 3 tablesp of oat flour as

61
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,599
the main ingredient to provide natural

62
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,599
nutrients for the orchid.

63
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,360
Add one liter of water to the oat flour

64
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,879
to dissolve it and create a natural

65
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,400
fertilizer

66
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:38,560
mixture. Cover the container and wait

67
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,720
for 2 hours to allow the nutrients from

68
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,460
the oat flour to fully dissolve into the

69
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:47,530
water.

[Music]

71
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,480
Next, sprinkle turmeric powder on the

72
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,480
cut surface of the orchid cutting to

73
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,620
prevent bacteria and promote faster

74
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:09,000

77
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,280
After 2 hours, strain out the sediment

78
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,120
to collect the clear liquid, which will

79
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,120
be used as a natural fertilizer for the

80
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,120
orchid.

81
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,160
Oat flour contains many natural vitamins

82
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,720
and minerals that provide essential

83
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,250
nutrients, stimulating orchid roots to

84
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,389
grow stronger and

86
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,639
healthier. The antioxidants in oat flour

87
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,800
help boost the plant's resistance,

88
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,840
keeping orchid leaves green and

89
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,910
promoting healthy growth.

91
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,680
Then add one teaspoon of honey into the

92
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,199
solution to boost nutrients and

93
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,120
stimulate the orchid's

94
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:15,120
growth. Honey has natural antibacterial

95
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,840
properties that help prevent the growth

96
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,120
of bacteria and fungi on cuts,

97
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,120
protecting the orchid from

98
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:26,720
infections. Then add three vitamin B1

99
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,320
tablets into the mixture to enhance

100
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,919
nutrient absorption and stimulate

101
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,919
stronger orchid root growth.

106
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,720
Then use this mixture to soak the orchid

107
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,800
roots for about 20 minutes, helping to

108
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,800
disinfect and stimulate faster root

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,800
growth.

110
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,080
While waiting, I prepare stakes to

111
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,319
secure the orchid after planting,

112
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,720
helping the plant stand firm and grow

[Music]

129
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,919
Next, plant the orchid into a new pot

130
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:07,800
with fresh, nutrient-rich growing medium

131
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,800
to support better growth.

132
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,720
I choose crushed pine bark as the

133
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,599
growing medium because it provides good

134
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,280
drainage, retains moderate moisture, and

135
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:23,560
creates a well ventilated environment

136
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,560
for healthy orchid root growth.

137
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,320
Using stakes to secure the orchid after

138
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,320
planting prevents the plant from shaking

139
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,279
uh thus protecting the new roots from

140
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,279
damage or negative impact.

142
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,279
Then water the orchid with this natural

143
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,040
fertilizer mixture to provide essential

144
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:19,000

From now on, use this mixture to water

149
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,920
or spray the entire orchid about two to

[Music]

153
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,839
When sprayed, the mixture supplies

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,760
nutrients directly through the leaves

155
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:06,399

159
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,440
wash away dust and fungal pathogens on

160
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,600
the leaves, keeping the orchid cleaner

163
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,040
Uh after spraying, use a soft cloth to

164
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,360
wipe off the water droplets on the

165
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:37,399
leaves to prevent mold growth and

166
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,399
protect the orchid from damage.

167
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,800
Next, I peel off the protective layer

the dormant kiki bud for about 30

185
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,240

187
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,079
stimulate the bud to awaken and begin

00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,800
buds. After 30 minutes, remove the

194
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,040
cotton. After that, if you place the

195
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,200
orchid pot in a cool and humid area, the

196
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,760
dormant bud will grow into a kiki

197
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,839
plantlet. However, if you place it in a

198
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,590
sunnier spot, the dormant bud will

199
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,440
develop into a flower

200
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:54,040
[Music]

201
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:57,199
bud. And here are the results after 5

202
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,800
weeks. Um, you can see that the roots

203
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,279
have grown very strong, indicating that

204
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,580
the orchid is recovering well and

205
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:07,440
absorbing nutrients effectively.

[Music]

207
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,760
When the roots are healthy, they help

208
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,839
the orchid absorb water and nutrients

209
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,320
more efficiently, leading to strong

210
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:19,680
growth, new leaves, new shoots, and an

211
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,680
easier blooming in the next

212
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:25,040
season. The leaves have also become

213
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,880
glossier and plumper, showing that the

214
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,090
plant is in a healthy and vigorous

215
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,249
growth state.

[Music]

217
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,160
And you can clearly see that the dormant

218
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,320
bud has developed into a kiki orchid

219
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,240
plantlet, proving that the stimulation

220
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,560
method is completely effective and safe

221
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,560
for the

222
00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:00,399
orchid. If you find this content helpful

228
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,680
Uh after that, I continue to care for

229
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,800
the orchid using fertilizer made from

230
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,480
oat solution, honey, and vitamin B1.

231
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,320
Watering or spraying two to three times

232
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,639
a month to keep the plant healthy and

233
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,639
growing well.

And here are the results after 10 weeks.

239
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,639
You can see that the kiki baby plant

240
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,440
from the stem cutting has grown very

241
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,440
strong with fresh robust roots proving

242
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,440
the effectiveness of the care method we

243
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,440
applied.

244
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,480
When the kiki baby plant on the stem

245
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,720
cutting is sturdy and has strong roots,

246
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,399
we can completely separate and replant

247
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,639
the baby orchid to help it grow better

248
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,639
and stronger.

[Music]

250
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,799
Now I separate the baby plant to replant

251
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,880
it individually, creating favorable

252
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,480
conditions for strong growth in an

253
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:17,079
environment with better controlled

254
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,079
light, humidity, and nutrients.

[Music]

257
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,440
I choose pine bark chips as the main

258
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,840
growing medium for the baby orchid

259
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,400
because it provides good arration,

260
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:51,280
retains moderate moisture, and supports

261
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,280
healthy root development.

262
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,720
[Music]

263
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,919
I spread a thin layer of moss on top to

264
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,200
retain moisture and create a soft

265
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:05,840
environment, helping protect the young

266
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,840
roots of the baby orchid for better

267
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,840
growth.

268
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,120
When planting in the pot, we only need

269
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,840
to place the orchid cutting from the

270
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,480
stem on top of the moss layer without

271
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,440
burying the roots under the medium,

272
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,200
which helps avoid damaging the young

273
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,750
roots and creates better conditions for

274
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,640
new root

275
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:30,480
[Music]

276
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:32,799
growth. Then, water the orchid to keep

277
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,360
it moist. Only when new roots grow and

278
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,520
firmly attach to the medium should you

279
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,720
start fertilizing, allowing the plant to

280
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,720
absorb nutrients more

281
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:45,120
effectively. If you care for them

282
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,960
patiently, gradually you will have a

283
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,559
beautiful orchid garden filled filled

284
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,280
