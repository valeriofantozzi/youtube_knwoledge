Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:12,898
 
In this video, I share a new type of organic fertilizer for orchids.

3
00:00:15,897 --> 00:00:25,895
It seems like every house has one but few people know about it

4
00:00:30,894 --> 00:00:40,892
Very convenient and very good for the growth of orchids.

5
00:00:57,889 --> 00:01:07,887
When the flower stalks wither, you need to cut them all off.

6
00:01:12,086 --> 00:01:22,884
and cut off damaged branches and leaves.

7
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:34,882
If the position of the orchid pot is not suitable, the orchid will not bloom.

8
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:48,879
Place them in a sunny spot.

9
00:01:52,878 --> 00:02:02,876
Without sunlight, flowers will not bloom.

10
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:19,873
But if the sun is too harsh, the orchid will easily go into shock and die.

11
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:46,867
This is chrysanthemum tea.

12
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:59,898
It is not only good for human health but also very good for the growth of orchids.

13
00:03:09,896 --> 00:03:19,894
Use 1 bag of chrysanthemum tea (or 5 bags of used chrysanthemum tea grounds).

14
00:03:22,894 --> 00:03:35,891
Soak in boiled water for 3 minutes.

15
00:04:06,885 --> 00:04:20,882
Take 1 teaspoon of honey.

16
00:04:39,878 --> 00:04:46,877
Take 1 liter of water.

17
00:04:48,877 --> 00:04:58,875
Then mix chamomile tea and honey into the water.

18
00:05:01,874 --> 00:05:11,872
So you have a special fertilizer.

19
00:05:15,871 --> 00:05:22,870
FIRST METHOD.

20
00:05:29,868 --> 00:05:39,900
Wipe the top and bottom of the leaves with honey chamomile tea.

21
00:05:50,898 --> 00:05:59,896
Honey has antiseptic properties that help kill fungi and insects very effectively.

22
00:06:08,894 --> 00:06:18,892
Honey and chrysanthemums contain many nutrients that are very good and safe for orchids to grow.

23
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:40,888
SECOND METHOD

24
00:06:43,887 --> 00:06:54,885
Apply this liquid fertilizer to the orchid roots 1-2 times a month.

25
00:07:01,884 --> 00:07:11,882
This type of fertilizer helps orchids increase resistance to pests.

26
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:30,878
because it provides essential nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sugar, vitamins...

27
00:07:37,876 --> 00:07:47,874
This type of fertilizer also creates conditions for beneficial microorganisms to grow, helping to protect orchids very well.

28
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:56,873
THIRD METHOD.

29
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:11,870
You can also spray this fertilizer on the entire orchid.

30
00:08:18,868 --> 00:08:28,900
Helps supplement nutrients through leaves very effectively.

31
00:08:36,898 --> 00:08:46,896
This method is also performed 1-2 times/month.

32
00:08:54,895 --> 00:08:59,894
RESULT

33
00:09:00,893 --> 00:09:10,891
After 2-3 times of applying this fertilizer, you will see good green orchids.

34
00:09:14,891 --> 00:09:24,889
Many roots and branches grow.

35
00:09:26,888 --> 00:09:36,886
Flowers bloom brightly and stay fresh for a long time.

36
00:09:42,885 --> 00:09:52,883
The whole garden blooms but does not cause the orchid to lose its strength.

37
00:09:59,882 --> 00:10:09,880
Flowers bloom for a long time before fading.

38
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:26,876
Thank you for watching the video. Good luck and see you in the next videos.
