00:00:03,097 --> 00:00:06,899
Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:08,066 --> 00:00:18,897
In this video, I share about the mystery behind the growth speed of orchid roots that few people know.

3
00:00:21,445 --> 00:00:30,428
These are orchids that people throw away.

4
00:00:33,904 --> 00:00:42,892
The leaves of this tree are still fresh so I will restore them.

5
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:19,751
This orchid's damage may be due to inorganic fertilizer shock.

6
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:35,882
Orchid growing media contaminated with many molds are also harmful to orchids.

7
00:01:42,062 --> 00:01:52,045
We need to cut off all damaged branches, leaves, and roots.

8
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:03,609
The roots were completely damaged.

9
00:02:06,225 --> 00:02:16,207
The orchid stem has also completely dried up.

10
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:36,869
Only 1 leaf left on the top is still fresh.

11
00:02:38,301 --> 00:02:46,268
Remove yellow leaves due to disease.

12
00:02:48,937 --> 00:02:56,932
then rinse with water.

13
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:30,892
Sprinkle cinnamon powder on the cut to help it heal quickly.

14
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:47,406
Leave for 1 day without watering until the wound is completely healed before planting.

15
00:03:51,124 --> 00:04:01,119
Using vinegar helps reduce the pH of the soil, creating good conditions for the growth of orchids.

16
00:04:02,121 --> 00:04:12,117
Take 3 tablespoons of vinegar.

17
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:22,648
Honey is antibacterial and contains natural sugars such as glucose and fructose,

18
00:04:22,648 --> 00:04:29,914
 which help energize orchids and stimulate their growth.

19
00:04:30,348 --> 00:04:36,137
Take 1 teaspoon of honey.

20
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:46,877
Add 500ml of water.

21
00:04:59,094 --> 00:05:06,378
Leave for 1 day before using.

22
00:05:09,327 --> 00:05:13,872
1 Day Later

23
00:05:29,518 --> 00:05:39,533
Wiping orchid leaves with this water helps eliminate fungi and bacteria that cause diseases in orchids.

24
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:15,793
Soak the leaf stalks in this water for 30 minutes.

25
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:23,633
This helps stimulate roots and sprouts to grow very quickly.

26
00:06:25,891 --> 00:06:33,889
The remaining water is used to irrigate other normal orchids.

27
00:06:38,888 --> 00:06:46,887
Helps roots grow healthily.

28
00:06:48,886 --> 00:06:58,318
The flowers bloom on the branches for a long time before fading.

29
00:07:13,013 --> 00:07:22,979
Fertilizing 1 to 2 times a month will help orchids bloom more and stay fresh longer.

30
00:07:27,878 --> 00:07:36,877
The flowers bloom more brightly than usual.

31
00:07:41,723 --> 00:07:51,874
Increases resistance to fungi and bacteria that cause orchid diseases.

32
00:08:20,681 --> 00:08:28,700
I use jute rope to grow orchids.

33
00:08:37,126 --> 00:08:46,096
Then wrap the jute rope around the leaf stem.

34
00:08:52,306 --> 00:09:00,293
Jute rope has the ability to absorb water and retain moisture very well.

35
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:34,020
Pour filtered water into the jar.

36
00:09:41,609 --> 00:09:51,583
This wire will absorb water to help keep the leaf drain moist.

37
00:09:55,064 --> 00:10:01,750
then put in a cool place.

38
00:10:02,692 --> 00:10:06,680
1 Month Later

39
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:19,402
You can see the roots are growing very well.

40
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:49,605
and also grew another young leaf

41
00:11:01,236 --> 00:11:11,867
If the roots grow healthy like this, plant it in a pot so it can grow in the outside environment.

42
00:11:28,656 --> 00:11:38,629
