Welcome to the happiness garden. Today I

will continue sharing a simple yet

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,120
effective method to help all types of

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,759
orchids grow healthily, develop strong

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:15,000

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,000

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,680
This is an orchid that was once thrown

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,400
into the trash, but today I will bring

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:28,400
it back and begin the recovery journey

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:31,460

Although the orchid has withered,

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,520
orchids are incredibly resilient plants.

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,160
Therefore, as long as they are properly

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,000
cared for, they can fully revive and

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:47,740

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,790

After washing, let the orchid dry

51
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,959
prevent root rot and create ideal

Um, to revive the orchid, I will use

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,040
rice, a familiar ingredient, but very

56
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,280
rich in nutrients to make a natural

57
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,150
fertilizer that helps the plant recover

58
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,840

60
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,920
Take about 3 teaspoon of rice and mix

61
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,840
them with 600 ml of hot water. This will

62
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,050
help effectively extract the natural

let the mixture steep until the water

67
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,840
has completely cooled. This process

68
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,810
allows the nutrients in the rice to

69
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:58,799

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,600
Step one, place the orchid in a clean

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,279
Um, what do you think about the way I

193
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,040
revived this little orchid? Don't

194
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,640
hesitate to leave a comment and share

195
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,360
your thoughts. I'd love to hear your

196
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,360

201
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,959
being with me.

202
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,480
Although the leaves are still wilted,

203
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,800
once the roots grow strong and dense,

204
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,200
the plant will gradually recover fully

205
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,519
and fresh green leaves will soon appear

206
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,800
as the roots are the lifeline that

207
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,800
nourishes the entire orchid.

208
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,000
When the roots are healthy, plant the

209
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,079
orchid in a pot with a suitable growing

210
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,079
medium to help it grow and get ready to

211
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,079
bloom.

212
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,160
I chose a pot with drainage holes at the

213
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,800
bottom to ensure the roots stay well

214
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,120
ventilated and to prevent water

215
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,320
accumulation uh that could cause root

216
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,639
rot during care.

217
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,120
At the bottom of the pot, I placed a few

218
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,360
pieces of foam to improve drainage and

219
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,079
keep the roots from getting water logged

220
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,399
when watering.

221
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,160
And the main growing medium I use is

222
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,880
dried moss that has been treated to

223
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,120
remove any fungi or diseases. It retains

224
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,650
moisture well and is safe for the young

225
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:47,120
roots during the recovery process.

[Music]

227
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,680
However, when planting with moss, make

228
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,320
sure not to pack it too tightly so the

229
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,079
roots have enough space to grow and to

230
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,720
avoid excessive moisture that that can

231
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,720
cause root rot.

232
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,360
During care, you should only water just

233
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,440
enough to keep the medium moist, as the

234
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,519
roots are still young and fragile after

235
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,720
recovery and can easily rot if the

236
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,720
environment is too wet.

[Music]

239
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,040
After planting, I will care for the

240
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,800
orchid using diluted rice water,

241
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,800
watering it twice a month to provide

242
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,800
natural nutrients and support healthy

243
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,800
growth.

244
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:15,839
[Music]

245
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,480
Diluted rice water contains many natural

246
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:21,120
vitamins and minerals such as vitamin B,

247
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,120
potassium, and phosphorus. When used

248
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,519
regularly, it helps stimulate healthy

249
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:29,000
root growth and supports more efficient

250
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,000
nutrient absorption.

251
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,760
In addition, rice water also helps

252
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
improve the plant's resistance, making

253
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,079
the leaves greener, thicker, and

254
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
healthier, while reducing fungal

255
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,760
diseases in humid conditions, which is

256
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,760
especially important during the recovery

257
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,760
phase.

258
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,279
After that, place the plant in a spot

259
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,600
with gentle sunlight in the morning or

260
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,079
late afternoon to support better

261
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,079
photosynthesis and continued strong

262
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,079
growth.

264
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,240
And here is the result after the next 3

265
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,160
months. The healthy orchid roots

266
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,480
spreading throughout the growing medium

267
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,920
show that the plant is absorbing well

268
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,760
and ready to grow.

269
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,320
And especially the orchid has also grown

270
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:27,040
two new flower buds looking plump and

271
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:30,430
healthy like a sweet reward in return

272
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:34,720

completely firm, showing that the plant

276
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,930
has recovered well and is growing

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,760

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,440
strong, which shows that the plant has

281
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,959
not only revived but is also ready to

282
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,959
enter a promising new blooming season.

completely care for and revive weak

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,480
orchids at home, allowing them to come

286
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,480
back strong and once again bloom

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,480
beautifully.

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,519
Uh, from a withered flower that seemed

289
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,360
close to dying, it has now recovered and

290
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,600
is even getting ready to bloom in the

291
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,160
