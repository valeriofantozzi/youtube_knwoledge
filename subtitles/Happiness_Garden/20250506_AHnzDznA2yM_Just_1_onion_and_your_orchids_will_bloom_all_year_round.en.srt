00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,590
share how to care for orchids using

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,320
natural and easy to find

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,350
fertilizer that helps keep orchid leaves

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:20,840
shiny and

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,800
healthy. This fertilizer will help the

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,410
orchid roots grow stronger and more

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,579
abundantly.

14
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:47,160
the flower buds will appear earlier and

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,160
they will also become plump and healthy.

[Music]

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,360
This fertilizer also helps multiple

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,510
branches grow on the same flower stem,

19
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:02,440
creating a beautiful and dense flower

00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,880
cluster. In addition, this fertilizer

22
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,920
helps the petals grow larger and stay on

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,280

wilting. Let's get started.

26
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,159
To make this amazing natural fertilizer

27
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,439
today, I'm using onions, something that

28
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,439
every household has in their

29
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:31,640

30
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,920
kitchen. Onions contain many natural

31
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,840
antibacterial compounds that help

32
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,000
protect orchid roots from fungal

33
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,380
diseases and stimulate strong new root

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,920
growth.

36
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,720
Um, when you eat onions, save the peels

37
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,439
to use as natural fertilizer. It's very

38
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,439
beneficial for orchids.

41
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,400
Take the peel of one onion and put it

42
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,400
into a clean jar.

Cover the jar and wait until the water

49
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,959
cools down

50
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,200

56
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,159
Once the water has cooled completely,

57
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:02,680
stir it well to extract the nutrients

58
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,680
from the onion peel into the water.

59
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,120
Then strain out the solids to keep only

60
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,120
the liquid.

61
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,120
Next, add about 10 milllers of fresh

62
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,120
milk to the

63
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,800
mixture. Fresh milk provides calcium and

64
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,120
protein, helping the orchid grow

65
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,759
stronger with vibrant green leaves and

66
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,759
long-lasting flowers.

67
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,080
In addition, fresh milk has

68
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,919
antibacterial and disinfectant

69
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,639
properties, helping protect the plant

70
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,639
from fungal diseases.

[Music]

72
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,759
Step one, use a soft cloth to soak up

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,479
the mixture and gently wipe both the top

74
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,479
and bottom of the

75
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,080
leaves. Wiping the leaves helps remove

76
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,880
dust and impurities, allowing the plant

77
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,880
to absorb light better.

78
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,840
Fresh milk has antibacterial properties

79
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,120
that help prevent fungi and harmful

80
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,120
bacteria from affecting the

81
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:06,160
plant. Wiping the leaves also helps the

82
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,680
stamata on the leaves to open wider

83
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,680
enhancing the photosynthesis process.

84
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,280
Wiping with this mixture also provides

85
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,960
calcium and protein from the milk,

86
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,960
helping the leaves stay healthy and grow

87
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:32,639
well. Uh, cleaning the leaves helps the

88
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,120
plant absorb light more efficiently,

89
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,120
promoting growth.

90
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,840
This mixture helps reduce the growth of

91
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,840
pests that harm the

92
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,080
plant. Wiping the leaves helps create a

93
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,840
natural protective layer, making the

94
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,720
leaves glossy and giving the plant a

95
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,720
fresh, vibrant look.

96
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,319
Once a month, you should wipe the leaves

97
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,080
with this mixture one to two times to

98
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,080
help your orchid stay healthy and grow

Step two, spray this mixture on the

105
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,440
leaves, especially the underside where

106
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,440
fungi and pests are more likely to

107
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,280
thrive.

108
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,840
Spraying this mixture is like washing

109
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,400
away dust, mold, and fungi on the leaves

110
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,479
and leaf joints, making the leaves

111
00:07:53,400 --> 00:08:00,080
glossy and keeping the plant

112
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:01,919

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,960
prevent pest attacks, protecting the

118
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,440
leaves from harmful factors.

119
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,120
Fresh milk provides calcium and protein,

120
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,120
improving the plant's health and

121
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,560
supporting the growth of leaves and

122
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,120
roots. Once a month, you should spray

123
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,199
this mixture one to two times. The best

124
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,599
time to do this is in the early morning

125
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,560
or late afternoon when the plant is not

126
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,560
exposed to harsh

127
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:40,560
sunlight. Step three, water the roots

128
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,560
and the orchid growing medium with this

129
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,560
mixture.

130
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,839

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,120
helps the flowers have brighter, more

195
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,800
vibrant colors, enhancing the beauty of

196
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,800
the orchid and making the garden more

197
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,800
lively.

199
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,880
The fertilizer mixture also supports the

200
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,040
orchid in maintaining its health

201
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,959
throughout the blooming process, helping

202
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,279
the plant withstand stress and grow

203
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:22,240
strong, ensuring that it continues to

204
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,240
bloom in the following

205
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,639
[Music]

206
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,200
seasons. You should spray the fertilizer

207
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,519
mixture on blooming orchids about 1 to

208
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,600
two times a month. The best time to do

209
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,519
this is in the early morning or late

210
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,240
afternoon when the temperature is not

211
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,720
too high, allowing the plant to absorb

212
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,030
nutrients easily without experiencing

213
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:49,850
heat

215
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,560
shock. Now, let's take a look at the

216
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:58,360
results after 1 month of using this

217
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,360
fertilizer care routine.

218
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,079
You can clearly see the changes in your

219
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,000
orchid with glossy, healthy leaves,

220
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:09,680
large, longlasting flowers, and

221
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,680
especially the strong growth of new

222
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:17,600
roots. The orchid will become healthier,

223
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,600
better able to fight off diseases, and

224
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,890
produce even more beautiful flowers in

225
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:26,079
the following seasons.

226
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:28,160
[Music]

227
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,920
The abundant growth of new roots shows

228
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,040
that the orchid has absorbed enough

229
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,040
nutrients from the natural

230
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,600
fertilizer. When the roots are healthy

231
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,240
and strong, the plant will have a solid

232
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,079
foundation to continue growing, allowing

233
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,000
the orchid to absorb enough water and

234
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:49,000
nutrients to nourish its flowers and

235
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
leaves.

236
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,720
The strong growth of the roots is also a

237
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,519
sign of a healthy plant system ready for

238
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,519
the next blooming

239
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:04,560
cycle. Uh the orchids that were

240
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,639
previously cared for with the natural

241
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,519
fertilizer made from milk and onion

242
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:13,880
skins have produced more buds which are

243
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,880
healthier, plumper, and stronger.

244
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,320
[Music]

245
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,639
The combination of nutrients from onion

246
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,600
skins and milk helps the orchid develop

247
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,800
strong buds, ensuring they will bloom

248
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,800
evenly and last

249
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,160
longer. The buds are not only plentiful

250
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,560
uh but also plump, showing that the

251
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:39,079
orchid is healthy and wellnourished,

252
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,079
ready to develop into beautiful flowers.

253
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,360
Multiple branches growing on the same

254
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,120
flower stem is a fantastic result of

255
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,000
using the natural fertilizer made from

256
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,000
milk and onion

257
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,360
skins. This fertilizer provides

258
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,519
essential nutrients that help the orchid

259
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,519
grow vigorously, stimulating a uniform

260
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,519
bloom.

261
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,560
And when the plant receives enough

262
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,399
nutrients, it will develop multiple

263
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,079
flower branches on the same stem,

264
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,440
creating a beautiful and dense bouquet

265
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,440
that adds more charm to your

266
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,279
garden. I hope this video will be very

267
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,839
