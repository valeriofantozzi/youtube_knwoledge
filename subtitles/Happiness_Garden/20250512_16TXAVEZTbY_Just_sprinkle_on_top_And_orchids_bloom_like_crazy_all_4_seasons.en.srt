Hello everyone. Today I'm going to share

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,680
with you a simple way to make natural

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,240
fertilizer at home, which will help your

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,620
orchids grow healthy, lush, and bloom

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,710
beautifully throughout the

7
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,279
garden. Thanks to this natural

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,279
fertilizer, the roots and leaves of the

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,279
plant will stay healthy, which in turn

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,519
helps the orchid produce not only more

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,519
flowers, but also longerlasting blooms

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,359
that retain their color and stay on the

13
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,439
stem for a long time before fading.

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,280
The method is very simple. Anyone can do

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,000
it using familiar ingredients found

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,480
right in the

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,480
kitchen. Let's get

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,719
started. You can easily notice that this

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,320
orchid is having a pro problem as many

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,440
of its leaves have turned yellow and

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,440
show signs of

22
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,840
rot. We need to remove the damaged

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,440
leaves from the orchid immediately as

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,760
this will help the plant recover and

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,760
grow better.

26
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,360
After removing the damaged leaves, we

27
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,760
need to carefully check the roots and

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,159
the orchid's growing medium to ensure

29
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:16,439
the plant is not infected and has a good

30
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,439
environment for for growth.

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,860
Cut off the damaged roots to help the

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,989
orchid regenerate and grow healthier.

[Music]

34
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,680
Um, this orchid pot I bought from an

35
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,520
industrial orchid garden is entirely

36
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,800
planted with moss which helps retain

37
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,160
moisture very well. However, if um if

38
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,599
the watering is not carefully

39
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,840
controlled, the plant is very prone to

40
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,840
root

41
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:32,160
rot. Therefore, I will remove about 2/3

42
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,959
of the old moss and replace it with new

43
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,120
growing medium, which is pine bark. uh

44
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,800
to help the roots stay more airrated and

45
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,000
prevent water

46
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,760
logging. You should not completely

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,959
remove the old growing medium because

48
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,280
the orchid still has flowers. Keeping it

49
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,280
will help to maintain moisture and grow

50
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,280
steadily.

51
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,680
Then remove the wilted flowers to help

52
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,840
the orchid focus its energy on

53
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,159
developing new buds and extend the

54
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,239
freshness of the remaining flowers on

55
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,239
the

56
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,800
stem. Next, we will prepare natural

57
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,879
fertilizer to help the orchid recover

58
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,640
quickly without affecting the beautiful

59
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,640
flowers remaining on the stem.

60
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,040
The first ingredient I need to make

61
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,040
natural fertilizer is

62
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,720
coffee. Take three teaspoons of coffee

63
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,720
and put them into the bottle.

64
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,949
[Music]

65
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,319
Next, pour one liter of boiling water

66
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,319
into the coffee

67
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,680
bottle.

68
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,120
Close the lid and let it sit overnight

69
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,400
so the nutrients from the coffee can

70
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,400
fully dissolve into the

72
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,720
water. The next ingredient I will use to

73
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,720
make natural fertilizer is oat flour.

74
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,120
Take 3 teaspoon of oat flour and put

75
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,120
them into the bottle.

76
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,479
Then add one liter of room temperature

77
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,479
water to the bottle.

78
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,320
Um, close the lid and let it sit

79
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,240
overnight so the nutrients from the oat

80
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,240
flour can fully dissolve into the

81

82
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,560
water. After one night, strain out the

83
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,560
coffee grounds and oat flour, keeping

84
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,720
only the liquid to use as fertilizer for

85
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,720

coffee grounds and oat flour, keeping

89
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,440
only the liquid to use as fertilizer for

90
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,440
the orchid.

95
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,440
Step one, use a soft cotton ball to soak

96
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,800
up the coffee mixture and gently wipe

97
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,800
the top and bottom of the orchid

98
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,000
leaves. Wiping the leaves with the

99
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,840
coffee solution helps remove dust and

100
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,840
residue from the leaf surface,

101
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,919
especially the top side where most of

102
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,199
the photosynthesis takes

103
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:09,440
place. Clean leaves help the plant

104
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,039
absorb light more effectively, thereby

105
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,520
boosting energy production for the

106
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,520
orchid's growth.

[Music]

108
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,560
Coffee contains natural compounds that

109
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,960
can gently polish the leaves, making the

110
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:29,120
orchid leaves look healthier and more

111
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,759
vibrant. A glossy leaf surface not only

112
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,280
looks attractive, but also reflects that

113
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,280
the plant is in good health and

114
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,280
thriving.

115
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,840
This is sy mold on the orchid. Orchids

116
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:52,039
that lack sunlight and are in humid

117
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:54,560
environments are often affected by sy

118
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:57,039
mold. The coffee solution also helps

119
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,440
eliminate fungi, especially sy mold on

120
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,440
orchid leaves.

121
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,479
Diluted coffee solution can provide a

122
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,199
small amount of nutrients such as

123
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:14,720
potassium and antioxidants directly

124
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,720
supporting the nutrition of the

125
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,919
leaves. Um, absorption through the leaf

126
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,599
epidermis helps increase resistance and

127
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,420
improve the overall vitality of the

128
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,199

The scent and natural compounds in

131
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,399
coffee can help reduce the presence of

132
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:37,080
small insects like aphids or fungusnats,

133
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,440
which are common pests that harm

134
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,279
orchids. Regularly wiping the leaves

135
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,000
helps keep the plant clean and less

136
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,000

of harmful mold and bacteria on the

140
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,000
leaves. At the same time, it creates

141
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,480
conditions for beneficial microorganisms

142
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,720
to thrive, promoting healthy orchid

143
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,959

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,560
coffee solution one to two times a month

147
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,040
helps keep the plant clean, provides

148
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:15,240
gentle nutrients, and reduces insects

this mixture once a week to provide

to help the plant absorb the maximum

235

nutrients. Then, take the orchid pot out

236
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,680
and place it in a spot with gentle

237
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,839

[Music]

242
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,600
To protect the new roots as they grow,

243
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,399
we need to secure the orchid with a

244
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,959
support stick to stabilize its position,

245
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,440
prevent movement that could break tender

246
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,199
roots, and create favorable conditions

247
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,440
for the plant to anchor itself to the

248
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,440
growing

medium. Remember, no matter how good the

251
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,199
fertilizer is, if the orchid lacks

252
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,639
sunlight, it will grow slowly, be prone

253
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,920
to rot, and will not be able to

254
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:32,079
bloom. Therefore, always place the

255
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,639
orchid pot in a spot with gentle

256
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,600
sunlight so the plant can

257
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:38,290
photosynthesize, absorb nutrients

258
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:47,680
