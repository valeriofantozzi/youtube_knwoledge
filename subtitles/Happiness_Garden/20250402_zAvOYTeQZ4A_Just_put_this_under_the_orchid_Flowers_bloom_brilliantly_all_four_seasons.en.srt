00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,720
started this is a phenopsis orchid after

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,960
it has finished blooming I bought it

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,960
from an orchid nursery for $3

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,840
today I will guide you on how to repot

14
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,840

00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,640
again after blooming orchids often

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,600
become exhausted because the nutrients

18
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,280
were focused on flowering leaving the

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,600
plant weak with poor resistance making

20
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:54,120
it susceptible to diseases like Leaf rot

21
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,120

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,960
after cutting off the old flower Spike I

24
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,600
proceed to remove the old plastic pot to

25
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,600

growth orchids planted in Moss retain

30
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,920
moisture very well however if the

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,159
environment is too moist and not

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,920

33
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:34,920
to fungal infections and root

34
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,750

35
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:48,310
replace it with fresh potting

00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,079

41
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,840
the roots creating the best conditions

42
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:01,840
for the plants growth

43
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:11,200
uh Moss is an excellent moisture

44
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,840
retaining medium but over time it can

45
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,560
decompose become compacted and restrict

46
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,720
air flow to the roots potentially

47
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,720
harboring bacteria and

48
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,280
fungi removing the old Moss will help

49
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,280
improve the air flow to the roots

50
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:37,640
if there are any soft rotting damaged or

51
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,640
shriveled Roots I will cut them off

52
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,400
immediately this helps prevent the rot

53
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,400
from spreading to the healthy

00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:55,800

55
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,800
quick recovery after repotting

56
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,360
uh by cutting off the damaged Roots the

57
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,599
plant will have space for new healthy

58
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,440

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,440
and nutrients more

60
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:21,239
effectively damaged Roots can reduce the

61
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,200
air flow in the pot leading to water

62
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:27,000

64
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,560
cutting off the damaged Roots allows the

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,560
plant to focus on growing new healthy

66
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,560
Roots which helps the Orchid Thrive

67
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,360
better cutting off the damaged Roots

68
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,720

after cutting off the damaged Roots it

72
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:09,280
is also important to remove wilted
