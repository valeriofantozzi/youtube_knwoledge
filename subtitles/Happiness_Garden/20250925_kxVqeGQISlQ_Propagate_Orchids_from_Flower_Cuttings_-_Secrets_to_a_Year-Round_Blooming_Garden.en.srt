00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,440
Welcome to the happiness garden. Today I

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,680
continue to share with you a method of

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,400
propagating orchids from spent flower

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,960
spikes, making the most of every part of

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,040
the plant. In this way, it not only

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,199
helps the mother plant continue to grow,

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,199
but also opens up the opportunity to

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,960
create healthy new orchid plants.

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,119
When the petals begin to fade, that is

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,080
the best time to cut the flower spike

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,160
for propagation. If cut too early, the

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,800
young spike is prone to rot and hard to

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,239
recover. While if left too old, the

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,239
chances of sprouting will decrease

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,239
significantly.

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,079
The flower nodes that have bloomed will

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,000
no longer have the ability to sprout

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,399
into new orchid plants, so we will

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,399
remove them.

[Music]

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,840
The nodes that have not bloomed yet like

23
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,320
this are the parts we can take advantage

24
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,799
of to propagate from the flower spike.

25
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,720
This is where new life is hidden with

26
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,200
the potential to grow into healthy young

27
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,200
orchid plants.

28
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,960
After cutting, use a very sharp knife to

29
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,600
trim again uh making the cut smoother

30
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,840
and removing the damaged tip. This is

31
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,000
very important because damaged tips are

32
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,159
prone to rot, affecting the ability to

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,640
propagate. A clean cut will help the

34
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,640
flower spike heal quickly and reduce the

35
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,000
risk of infection, creating the best

36
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,000
conditions for new shoots to grow.

[Music]

38
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,720
Next, gently peel off the outer

39
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,440
protective layer to wake up the dormant

40
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,520
bud. This step helps the bud come into

41
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,280
contact with air and light, creating

42
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,280
favorable conditions for it to start

43
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,280
growing.

44
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,760
Be very careful not to damage the bud

45
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,560
inside because this is where new life

46
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,840
will begin.

[Music]

58
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,720
Now I will prepare a natural fertilizer

59
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,159
to support the propagation process to go

60
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,640
better.

61
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,720
The first ingredient I choose is ginger.

62
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:21,159
A familiar spice but with amazing

63
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,159
effects in stimulating bud growth.

64
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,720
Take a small piece of ginger, then slice

65
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,239
it into very thin pieces. Slicing thinly

66
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,159
will help the nutrients in the ginger

67
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,920
dissolve more easily into the water,

68
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,630
bringing better results when used to

69
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,919
care for the flower spike.

72
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,599
After slicing, put the ginger slices

73
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,519
into a very clean container. Uh, using a

74
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,560
clean container helps keep the solution

75
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,300
pure and prevents bacteria or mold from

76
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,379
harming the flower spike.

[Music]

79
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,639
Um, the next ingredient I choose is

80
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,359
rice. Just about 3 teaspoons of rice is

81
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,360
enough. Rice is a wonderful natural

82
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,440
source of nutrients for the plant,

83
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,600
containing many vitamins and minerals

84
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,680
that help stimulate the growth of roots

85
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,680
and young shoots. When combined with

86
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,240
ginger, they create a solution that is

87
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,320
both mildly antibacterial and provides

88
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,320
energy to help the buds sprout more

89
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,320
strongly.

90
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,160
Now, pour one liter of clean water into

91
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,160
the prepared ginger and rice.

92
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,560
Stir the mixture well, then cover it and

93
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,080
let it sit for 20 minutes. The soaking

94
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,240
time will help the nutrients from the

95
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,240
ginger and rice completely dissolve into

96
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,880
the water, creating a natural,

97
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,800
nutrient-rich solution. This is an

98
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,280
important step to obtain a mixture that

99
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,600
is both mildly antibacterial and

100
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,600
stimulates the buds and roots to grow

101
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,600
stronger.

102
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,440
Next, take 400 ml of clean water and

103
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,120
pour it into a cup. This will be the

104
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,800
water used to mix the medium

105
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,800
disinfecting solution, helping to

106
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,199
eliminate harmful bacteria and fungi

107
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,199
before replanting.

108
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,039
Then add about 3 to four drops of

109
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,960
methylene blue. This is a mild

110
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,880
disinfectant that helps eliminate any

111
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,199
remaining bacteria and mold in the

112
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,199
growing medium.

113
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,240
Next, I put the dried moss growing

114
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,199
medium into the prepared solution and

115
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,960
soak it for about 20 minutes. This

116
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,800
soaking time will help the moss be

117
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,759
completely disinfected, removing

118
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,759
pathogens and harmful bacteria. At the

119
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,759
same time, the moss will absorb enough

120
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:20,120
moisture, creating an ideal environment

121
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,120
for the flower spike when replanting.

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,880
While waiting for the moss to finish

123
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,639
soaking, I reuse plastic cups to recycle

124
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,800
them into tools for sprouting baby

125
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,440
orchids from the flower spike. This

126
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,000
recycling not only saves costs but is

127
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,080
also environmentally friendly. The small

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,080
cups will create a humid and warm

129
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,880
environment which is very suitable for

130
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,880
young shoots to grow.

[Music]

133
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,280
after soaking for about 20 minutes, stir

134
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,599
the mixture once more. This step helps

135
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,919
the nutrients in the ginger and rice

136
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,479
fully dissolve, creating a uniform and

137
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,319
nutrient-rich solution. This is when the

138
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,000
solution is ready for you to strain out

139
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,720
the clear liquid and use it for

140
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,720
propagation.

into a clean cup and soak the flower

145
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,479
spike for about 20 minutes. This soaking

146
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,039
time will help the spike absorb enough

147
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,440
nutrients, wake up the dormant buds, and

148
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,360
stimulate them to start growing. This is

149
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,360
an important step to lay the foundation

150
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,240
for healthy baby orchids to form from

151
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,240
the spent flower spike.

153
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,080
The remaining solution can be used to

water the roots and growing medium of

155
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,880
the mother orchid. This will provide

156
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,719
extra nutrients, help the roots grow

157
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,279
strong, and stimulate the plant to form

158
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,039
new flower spikes. This is a simple yet

159
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,919
effective way to help the mother plant

beautiful blooming season.

162
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,200

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,800
feeding the roots, new leaves, and new

165
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,040
flower buds. Removing old leaves helps

166
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,839
the plant stay healthier, reduces the

167
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,160
risk of pests and diseases, and creates

168
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,160
favorable conditions for new growth.

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,360
gently sprinkle it on the cut of the

203

204
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,519
act as a natural disinfectant,

205
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,360

into the prepared propagation container.

213
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,200
Make sure the spike is gently secured on

214
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,680
the loose moss layer so the buds can

216
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,839
Arranging it carefully will help the
