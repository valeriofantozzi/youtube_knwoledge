13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,360
Let's get started.

14
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,360
To make this magical fertilizer, first

15
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:51,920
prepare 3 L of clean water in a clean

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:54,640
container, ready for the next steps.

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,600
Next, you can use expired milk or

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,680
leftover milk from the fridge. A great

24
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,680
way to avoid waste and help your orchids

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,680
grow.

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:20,320
Just about 1 tsp of milk, equivalent to

27
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,479
around 15 ml, is enough for this recipe.

28
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,159
Next, simply stir the milk into the

29
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,159
water until the mixture is fully

30
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,159
blended.

31
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,200
Next, we will add a little lemon juice

32
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,200
to the mixture.

33
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,920
You can choose either a yellow lemon or

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,150
a green lime. Both provide excellent

35
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:47,840

The first method is to use a soft cloth

to soak up the mixture and gently wipe

51
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,160
both the top and underside of the leaves

52
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,580

stay clean, photosynthesize more easily,

57
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,280

can absorb the nutrients optimally.

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,639
This spraying method also helps clean

94
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,639
dust and remove insects on the leaves,

95
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,960
especially on the underside where pests

96
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,960
often hide.

97
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,280
Additionally, spraying the mixture on

98
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,600
