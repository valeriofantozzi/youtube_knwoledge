00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
Welcome to my channel

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,899
In my hand is a dry orchid branch

3
00:00:10,748 --> 00:00:16,197
And I will revive it to become a healthy orchid

4
00:00:17,657 --> 00:00:23,896
First, it is necessary to remove damaged roots

5
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:33,894
Then apply glue to the cut to help the bark heal quickly and prevent rot.

6
00:00:37,597 --> 00:00:40,892
and wait 1 day for the glue to dry

7
00:01:22,255 --> 00:01:28,883
After 1 day, apply aloe vera gel on the orchid stem

8
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:38,881
This helps retain moisture and stimulates germination on dry orchid stems

9
00:02:28,954 --> 00:02:36,936
Then place the orchid stem on a layer of damp moss

10
00:02:59,901 --> 00:03:05,897
Spray moisturizer every 3 days

11
00:03:15,645 --> 00:03:23,894
Cover tightly with a transparent plastic box like a miniature greenhouse

12
00:03:33,634 --> 00:03:38,891
3 Weeks Later

13
00:04:05,266 --> 00:04:13,064
The old orchid stem has sprouted a small sprout

14
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:48,877
Continue to place in a cool, well-lit place and spray with moisturizing mist every 3 days

15
00:04:50,346 --> 00:04:53,876
2 MONTHS LATER

16
00:05:02,856 --> 00:05:10,873
From a small sprout, it has grown into a healthy baby orchid

17
00:05:49,554 --> 00:05:56,897
The new root system is very strong

18
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:13,894
This will help the orchid absorb nutrients through the roots best

19
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:57,885
Now I need to plant them in pots so they can grow in their natural environment outside

20
00:07:09,467 --> 00:07:18,881
I plant with charcoal and pumice which helps keep moisture well and the roots are always well ventilated

21
00:08:22,796 --> 00:08:30,460
Cover the top of the pot with a little moss to help retain moisture better

22
00:08:34,102 --> 00:08:40,898
Spray moisturizer on orchids every 3 days

23
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:50,896
Note: Only when the roots cling to the orchid growing medium can you fertilize the orchid

24
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:58,894
Thank you for viewing

25
00:08:58,894 --> 00:09:05,893
Good luck and see you in the next video
