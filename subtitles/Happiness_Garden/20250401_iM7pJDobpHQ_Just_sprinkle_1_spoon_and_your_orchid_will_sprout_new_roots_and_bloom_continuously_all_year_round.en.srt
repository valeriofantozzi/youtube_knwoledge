Welcome to my

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:10,360
channel. When you grow orchids, it is

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,120
unavoidable that the leaves may

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,440
rot. If your orchid's leaves are rotting

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,680
like this, don't worry because in this

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,560

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,920
you quickly treat leaf rot in

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,279
time. First, you need to cut off the

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,920
rotting part of the leaf from the

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:31,760
orchid. This helps prevent the rot from

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,760
spreading to the stem and other healthy

12
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,960
leaves. Then we check the roots and

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,399
remove any rotten ones from the orchid.

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,000
This helps prevent the rot from

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,840
spreading throughout the entire plant

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,840
from the roots to the stem and

17
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,559
leaves. Please comment to me which

43
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,520
Uh, it's best to check the orchid once a

44
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,520
week to remove yellow or rotting

45
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,000
leaves. For orchids with rotting leaves

46
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,640
caused by bacteria, we need to isolate

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,080
them from the garden to treat the rot.

48
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,879
This helps prevent the rot from

49
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,879
spreading to other

50
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,080
plants. Now I am using turmeric powder

51
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,280
because it has excellent natural

52
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,720
antibacterial and anti-inflammatory

53
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:04,440

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,440
orchid leaf rot.

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,200
Apply turmeric powder to the cut as it

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,200
helps the wound heal

58
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,280
quickly. This helps reduce the risk of

59
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,680
infection and aids the plant in

60
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,680

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,799
Moreover, turmeric helps stimulate the

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,720
process of cell regeneration, allowing

64
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,599
the cut to heal quickly and the plant to

65
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,599
return to a healthy state.

66
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,959
Then place it in a well ventilated area

67
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,959
and avoid watering to help the cut heal

68
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:17,120
quickly. Then add one teaspoon of

69
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,040
turmeric powder into a bottle and mix it

70
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,600
with four cups of hot water, about one

71
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,600

72
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,479
Cover the bottle and wait for the water

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,479
to cool

74
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,960

75
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,960
as a very good natural fertilizer for

76
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,960

77
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,680
Take 1 tbsp of oatmeal powder and mix it

96
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,080
The first step is to soak a cotton ball

97
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,759
in the turmeric water mixture and gently

98
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,240
wipe both the top and bottom of the

99
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,240
orchid leaves.

100
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,800
Wiping the leaves with turmeric water

101
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,160
not only helps clean the leaves but also

102
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,080
provides nutrients that keep the leaves

103
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,120
healthy. Additionally, it has

104
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,280
anti-inflammatory and antibacterial

105
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,280
properties helping the leaves avoid

106
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,280
diseases.

107
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,639
You should wipe evenly and gently to

108
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,639
avoid damaging the

109
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,560
leaves. Turmeric contains curcumin which

110
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,960
helps reduce inflammation and prevent

111
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,360
the growth of harmful bacteria and fungi

112
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,440
on the leaves. This helps the plant

113
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,599
fight against diseases such as leaf rot

114
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,599
and

115
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,319
mold. Curcumin and turmeric also has

116
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,000
antioxidant properties, protecting the

117
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,880
leaves from the harmful effects of the

118
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,560
environment and strong sunlight, helping

119
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,560
the orchid leaves maintain their

120
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,879
freshness. To care for orchids

121
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,879
effectively, you can wipe the leaves

122
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,280
with turmeric water about one to two

123
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,280
times a

124
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:16,000

125
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,879
into a spray bottle. Then spray it onto

126
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,879
the entire orchid plant.

127
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,479
Um, this helps the turmeric water cover

128
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,080
the leaves, roots, and stem evenly,

129
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,200
providing nutrients and protecting the

130
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,200
plant from harmful agents.

131
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,560
Regularly spraying turmeric water helps

132
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,519
the orchid maintain its health, reduce

133
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,519
inflammation, and prevent mold

134
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:04,160
growth. You should spray turmeric water

135
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,399
on the orchid about one to two times a

136
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,880
month. This is enough to provide the

137
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,959
plant with nutrients from turmeric while

138
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,200
also protecting the leaves from bacteria

139
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,560
and fungi without causing excess

140
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,560
moisture to linger too

141
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,519
long. Um, if the plant has health issues

142
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,959
or is infected, you can do it more

143
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,800
frequently, but for healthy plants, a

144
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,800
frequency of one two times a month is

145
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,800
ideal.

146
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,640
Now, mixing turmeric water with oatmeal

147
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,240
water is a great way to create a

148
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,240
natural, nutrient-rich mixture for

149
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,040
orchids. Oatmeal water is rich in

150
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,640
vitamins and minerals, providing

151
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,640
essential nutrients for the plant's

evenly, ensuring the mixture soaks into

171
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,760

[Music]

175
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,720
Moss has excellent moisture retention,

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,160
so you only need to water with this

177
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,160
mixture once every 2

178
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,880
weeks. With moss as the growing medium,

179
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,680
you don't need to water too frequently

180
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,360
because it retains water longer, helping

181
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,839

is bark chips, it drains water faster.

186
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,000
So, you will need to water with this

187
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,640
mixture once a week to ensure the plant

188
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,640
receives enough nutrients.

189
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,680
Bark chips don't retain moisture as well

190
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,839
as moss, so more frequent watering is

191
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:17,480
needed to ensure the plant doesn't lack

192
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,480
water and nutrients.

193
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:24,219
[Music]

194
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,959
Step four. After watering the plant with

195
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,959
the turmeric and oatmeal mixture, you

196
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:42,240
should wipe off any remaining mixture on

197
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,240
the leaves and leaf

198
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,839
axles. Uh this is an important step to

199
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,560
prevent the mixture from remaining on on

200
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,000
the plant which could create prolonged

201
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,760
moisture and provide favorable

202
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,760
conditions for mold or bacterial growth.

203
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,560
Um, you can use a soft cloth or cotton

204
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,399
ball to gently wipe away any excess,

205
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,880
ensuring that areas like the top and

206
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:18,880
bottom of the leaves and the leaf axles

207
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,880
are dry and not left wet for too

208
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,800
long. This helps the orchid maintain its

209
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,120
health, prevents mold, and keeps the

210
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,120
leaves clean.

211
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,079
After wiping off the excess mixture, you

212
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,880
should place the orchid pot in a spot

213
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,639
with gentle sunlight as light is a

214
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,959
crucial factor that helps the orchid

215
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,959
perform photosynthesis and grow

216
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:52,320
well. However, you should avoid direct

217
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:56,760
and intense sunlight as it can cause

218
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,760
leaf burn or stress the plant.

220
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,480
Now, let's take a look at the results

221
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,800
after 2 months of caring for the orchid.

222
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,720
The with it with the natural fertilizer

223
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,720
mixture made from turmeric powder and

224
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,519
[Music]

225
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,680
oatmeal. You can see that my orchid pot

226
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,399
has grown three new flower spikes, all

227
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,320
thick and healthy. This shows that the

228
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,120
natural fertilizer made from turmeric

229
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,519
powder and oatmeal has truly had an

230
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,519
amazing

231
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,320
effect. Not only has it produced many

232
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,040
new flower spikes, but it's also

233
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,480
developed many new

234
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,320
roots. This proves that the plant is

235
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,519
very healthy and receiving enough

236
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,519
nutrients from the natural fertilizer.

237
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:52,800
[Music]

238
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,440
New roots help the orchid absorb water

239
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,199
and nutrients more efficiently, which in

240
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,760
turn helps the plant grow better and

241
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,760
maintain its

242
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,199
health. The strong growth of the flower

243
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,279
spikes is a sign that the plant is

244
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,120
receiving all the necessary nutrients

245
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,360
and the care environment is perfect for

246
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,360
its growth.

247
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,160
This orchid, although smaller, has grown

248
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,399
two flower spikes after 2 months of

249
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,399
careful care, which is a very positive

250
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,399
sign.

251
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,040
This proves that although the plant

252
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,480
doesn't grow as vigorously as the

253
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,759
others, with the right care and natural

254
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:57,399
fertilizer, it can still bloom and

255
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,399
recover its health.

256
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,800
Uh this is a clear example that patience

257
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,480
and careful care will help the plant

258
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,480
recover and produce beautiful

259
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:26,959
blooms. Here's another regular orchid.

260
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,800
And when cared for using this method,

261
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:33,720
you can clearly see the difference. The

262
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,720
leaves are vibrant, firm, and healthy.

263
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:53,170
The flower spikes are not only large but

264
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,120
also thick and full of vitality.

265
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:57,040
[Music]

266
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,360
This care method has helped the plant

267
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,519
grow vigorously and bloom brilliantly,

268
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,720
proving its exceptional effectiveness in

269
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,720
nurturing and caring for

270
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,760
orchids. With this simple method, you

271
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,120
can easily care for and revive orchids

272
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,000
right at home, helping them grow

273
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,000
healthily and bloom beautifully.
