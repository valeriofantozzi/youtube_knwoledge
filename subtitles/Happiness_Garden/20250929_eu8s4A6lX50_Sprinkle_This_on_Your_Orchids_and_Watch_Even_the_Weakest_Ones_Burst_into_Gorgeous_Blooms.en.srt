00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,120
Welcome to the happiness garden. Here we

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,520
will explore together how to care for

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,200
orchids in a natural and effective way

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,320
so that the plants are always healthy

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,719
and bloom brilliantly. When caring for

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,800
orchids, the most important part is the

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,279
roots because healthy roots help the

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,800
plant absorb nutrients well, nourishing

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,199
fresh green leaves and brilliant

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,519
flowers.

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,199
Do you have cucumbers? When eating

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,359
cucumbers, don't rush to throw away the

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,519
peel. Keep it because cucumber peels

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,000
contain many wonderful nutrients for the

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,320
plants. You can turn the peels into

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,920
natural fertilizer, helping the plants

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,920
grow healthy from roots to leaves.

journey.

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,040
After peeling, take the peels and put

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,040
them into a blender to prepare for

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,040
grinding.

33
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,490
The next ingredient is rice. You only

34
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:36,320
need one teaspoon of rice.

36
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,920
Next, add 500 ml of water.

[Music]

39
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,799
Then cover the mixture and let it

40
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,200
ferment for about 6 hours to allow light

41
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,799
fermentation. This fermentation process

42
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,280
will release more nutrients from the

43
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,039
ingredients, creating a nutrientrich

44
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,840
natural fertilizer that is easily

45
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,840
absorbed by the orchids.

[Music]

47
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,000
Um, after fermenting for about 6 hours,

48
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,920
blend the mixture again. Blending after

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,080
fermentation helps release the nutrients

50
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,319
to the maximum, creating a smooth

51
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,640
fertilizer solution that is easily

52
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:42,419
absorbed by the orchids.

54
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,840
Next, strain out the solids to obtain a

55
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,519
smooth liquid fertilizer.

56
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,760
Removing the solids helps the solution

57
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,159
absorb easily into the orchid roots,

58
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,159
prevents clogging, and keeps the plants

59
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,159
clean.

61
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:36,000
Then dilute with more water to get about

62
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,760
3 L of fertilizer mixture. Um, diluting

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
helps the solution be gentle enough for

64
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,519
the orchid roots to absorb effectively

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,990
while preventing it from being too

66
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:48,099
strong, which could harm the plants.

00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,099
[Music]

68
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,040
First, we need to clean the leaves. Take

69
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,439
a soft cloth and wipe the leaves with

70
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,810
this mixture, making sure both the top

71
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,310
and bottom surfaces are cleaned.

72
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,310
[Music]

73
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,040
Wiping the leaves helps remove dust and

74
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,799
deposits on the leaf surface.

75
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,959
When the leaves are clean, light can

76
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,400
easily reach the photosynthetic tissues,

77
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,639
allowing the plant to synthesize

78
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,140
nutrients more effectively, thus

79
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:25,209
nourishing healthy leaves and flowers.

80
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,209
[Music]

81
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,400
Uh the leaf wiping mixture also helps

82
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,320
remove bacteria, fungi, and pathogens on

83
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,400
the leaves. This reduces the risk of

84
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,720
disease and protects the overall health

85
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,720
of the plant, especially in humid

86
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,720
environments.

87
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,639
Wiping the leaves with this mixture also

88
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,440
helps distribute nutrients from the

89
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,440
solution directly onto the leaf surface.

90
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,600
The leaves absorb a small amount of

91
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,000
nutrients supporting the plant to grow

92
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,000
healthy and maintain overall nutritional

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
balance.

94
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,280
Be careful to wipe the underside of the

95
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,919
leaves. The underside is often moist

96
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,680
where insects and fungi tend to hide.

97
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,759
They only wait for an opportunity and

98
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,720
when conditions are favorable, they can

99
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,560
harm and damage the orchids. Thoroughly

100
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,960
wiping the underside helps remove these

101
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:31,400
hiding spots for pests, protecting the

102
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,400
plant and maintaining vibrant blooms.

103
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,160
The orchid leaves once cleaned become

104
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,240
shinier.

105
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,840
A fresh leaf surface not only looks

106
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,759
beautiful but also helps the plant

107
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,680
absorb light better, enhancing

108
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,880
photosynthesis and supporting full

109
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,880
development from roots to flowers.

110
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,039
The habit of wiping leaves one to two

111
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,360
times a month helps you observe small

112
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,080
changes in the plant. You can detect

113
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,479
issues early, such as pests, yellowing

114
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,000
leaves, or weak roots, and take timely

115
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:12,039
care measures to keep the orchids

116
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,039
healthy and blooming brilliantly.

[Music]

118
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,440
Next, water this mixture onto the roots

119
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,520
and the growing medium.

120
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,600
Direct watering helps the nutrients

121
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,600
penetrate deep into the roots,

122
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,759
nourishing the plant from the base up,

123
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,600
while also enriching the growing medium,

124
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,080
creating an ideal environment for the

125
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,000
orchids to thrive.

126
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,080
When done regularly, the orchid roots

127
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,120
become stronger, leaves stay green, and

128
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,120
flowers bloom more brilliantly.

129
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,080
Regular watering helps stimulate the

130
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,479
roots to produce new shoots. Strong,

131
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,319
healthy roots mean green leaves and

132
00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,840
brilliant blooms, bringing lasting

133
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,840
vitality and beauty to your garden.

[Music]

135
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,199
Regularly watering with the mixture also

136
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,960
stimulates vigorous growth of new roots.

137
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,440
Healthy new roots support lush green

138
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,319
leaves, beautiful flowers, and extend

139
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,319
the lifespan of the orchid.

140
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,960
The watering mixture also helps clean

141
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,520
the growing medium and wash away excess

142
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,680
mineral salts. This prevents root

143
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,080
toxicity and keeps the plant in optimal

144
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,080
growth condition.

145
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,919
This watering also helps maintain proper

146
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,680
moisture for the roots, preventing them

147
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,240
from drying out or becoming water

148
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,720
logged. When the roots have an ideal

149
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,520
moist environment, the orchids grow more

150
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,520
steadily and healthfully.

151
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,560
Apply this mixture twice a month,

152
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,479
alternating with regular watering when

153
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,080
the growing medium is dry.

154
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,479
You can also put the mixture into a

155
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,560
spray bottle to mist the plants. This

156
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,120
method allows the fertilizer solution to

157
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,520
evenly reach the leaves, roots, and even

158
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,800
small gaps in the growing medium while

159
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,800
gently adding moisture to the orchids.

160
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,080
Misting the mixture helps the orchid

161
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,639
leaves directly absorb nutrients from

162
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,400
the fertilizer, providing essential

163
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,479
trace elements to support healthy

164
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,639
growth. When the leaves receive enough

165
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,879
nutrients, the plant increases its

166
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:35,959
photosynthesis capacity, generating

167
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,959
energy to nourish roots and flower.

168
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,560
At the same time, spraying the leaf

169
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:45,040
surfaces helps clean dust and pathogens,

170
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,480
reducing the risk of pest development.

171
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,920
Clean and healthy leaves are the

172
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,040
foundation for the orchids to bloom

173
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,040
regularly and last longer.

174
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,399
The mixture also provides gentle

175
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,959
moisture to the leaves and leaf

176
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,279

humid environment, especially on dry

178
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,160
days. Well moisturized leaves stay

179
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,530
green, reducing wilting and maintaining

180
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,760
the plant's vitality.

growing medium and roots. When the new

187
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,839
roots are healthy, the orchid absorbs

188
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,279
nutrients more effectively and the

189
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,279
leaves and flowers develop more

190
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,279

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,000
observe small changes in the plant,

194
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,959
detecting issues early, such as pests,

195
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,560
yellowing leaves, or weak roots. This

196
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,399
allows you to provide timely care,

197
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,279
keeping the orchids healthy and blooming

198
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,279
brilliantly all year round.

199
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,160
Note, do not spray the mixture onto the

200
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,080
flower petals. When the flowers are wet,

201
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,080
the petals can easily fall off or get

202
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,040
damaged, reducing the orchid's vibrant

203
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,959
beauty. Focus on spraying the leaves,

204
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,279
roots, and growing medium so the plant

205
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,040
can optimally absorb nutrients, helping

206
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,150
the orchids grow healthy and bloom

207
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:28,419
longer.

[Music]

209
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,720
Next, I will share how to care for weak

210
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,200
orchids using a natural fertilizer

211
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,020
mixture made from cucumber peels and

212
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,839
lightly fermented rice.

213
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:41,760
[Music]

214
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,399
You can see that this orchid has wilted

215
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,800
leaves. The roots are still fresh, but

216
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:50,200
overall the plant is very weak and needs

217
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,200
special care.

218
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:57,680
[Music]

219
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,079
First, use a soft cloth soaked in the

220
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,480
mixture to wipe the leaves clean, uh,

221
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,320
removing dust as well as pathogens,

222
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,560
fungi, and harmful insects on the

223
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,480
leaves. Cleaning the leaves helps the

224
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,079
orchids absorb light better, enhancing

225
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,920
photosynthesis.

226
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,079
This makes the plant healthier and more

227
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,110
resilient to adverse conditions while

228
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:32,240
preparing it for full recovery.

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,280
wonderful to have you along for the

234
00:11:41,440 --> 00:12:06,789
journey.

235
00:11:44,280 --> 00:12:06,789
[Music]

236
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,680
You observe that when the orchid roots

237
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:22,800
turn silvery, it means the plant needs

238
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,639
watering. At this time, water the orchid

239
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,120
thoroughly with the natural fertilizer

240
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:31,240
mixture, helping the roots absorb enough

241
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,240
moisture and essential nutrients.

242
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,360
Watering at the right time and

243
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,839
thoroughly will help the plant recover

244
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,560
quickly with new roots developing and

245
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,800
new leaves forming. When the roots and

246
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,800
leaves are wellnourished, the orchid

247
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,000
will be healthier and ready to bloom

248
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,000
beautifully in the upcoming cycles. This

249
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,160
regular care habit creates a solid

250
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,720
foundation, helping the orchids grow

251
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,120
sustainably and maintain long- lasting

252
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,279
vitality.

253
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,880
[Music]

254
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,360
You can also put the mixture into a

255
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,519
spray bottle to mist the plants. This

256
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,760
method allows the solution to evenly

257
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,079
reach the leaves, roots, and growing

258
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,920
medium while gently adding moisture to

259
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,839
the orchids.

260
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,079
When done regularly, the orchids will

261
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,920
grow healthy with vibrant green leaves

262
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,520
and brilliant blooms, bringing full

263
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:26,000
vitality to your garden.

[Music]

265
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,240
And here is the result after 2 weeks of

266
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,839
care using the natural fertilizer made

267
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,480
from cucumber peels and lightly

268
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:37,760
fermented rice. You can see that from a

269
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,959
weak orchid in just 2 weeks, it has

270
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,639
developed many healthy new roots. This

271
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,480
recovery also means the leaves will be

272
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,480
greener and the plant is gradually ready

273
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,490
to bloom, bringing full vitality to your

274
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,320

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,560
Um, what do you think about how I

277
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,240
revived this small orchid? Uh, don't

bloom abundantly.

286
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,040
The roots of other orchids have also

287
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,240
grown very strong. This proves that

288
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,320
caring for them with a natural

289
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,560
fertilizer mixture made from cucumber

290
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,290
peels and lightly fermented rice is

291
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,720
truly effective.

292
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:32,720
[Music]

293
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,000
When the roots are healthy, the leaves

294
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,240
are green and the flowers bloom more

295
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,600
brilliantly, bringing lasting vitality

296
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,600
and beauty to the entire garden.

297
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,199
Not only do the flowers bloom

298
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,279
brilliantly, but the petals also stay uh

299
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,600
firmly on the stems for a long time

300
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,920
before wilting. This shows that the

301
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,600
orchid is not only healthy in its roots

302
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,920
and leaves, but also maintains

303
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,680
long-lasting vitality for the flowers.

304
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,160
With proper care, you can enjoy the

305
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:08,760
enduring beauty of each bloom, bringing

306
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,760
joy and color to your garden.
