Hello orchid lovers. Welcome to the

happiness garden

00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,639
channel. Today I will show you how to

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,840
make natural fertilizer that is both

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,910
simple and

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,320
effective. This fertilizer will help

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,400
your orchids grow sustainably and bloom

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:30,880
for a longer time.

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,679
Now, let's get

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,800
started. This orchid has finished

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,879
blooming. If not properly cared for, the

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,600
plant can become stunted and grow

15
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,360
slowly. So, post-flowering care is very

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,510
important to help the plant recover and

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:55,670
prepare for the next blooming cycle.

20
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,430
First remove all damaged, rotting or

00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:14,400
roots. This will allow the orchid to

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,400
focus its energy on healthy parts for

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,400
growth.

26
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,720
This process also helps stimulate the

27
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,680
plant to grow new roots and prepares it

28
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,680
for the next growth

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,759
cycle. After removing damaged roots, we

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,340
will proceed to cut off all unhealthy

32
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,419

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,320
Next, cut off the old flower stems so

36
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,360
the plant can focus its energy on

37
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,360
growing new roots and

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,599
leaves. Old flower stems usually no

39
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,360
longer have the ability to grow and can

40
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,360
cause the plant to waste energy if left

Sprinkle a layer of cinnamon powder onto

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,239
the cut areas to disinfect and prevent

45
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,239
infection.

46
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,640
Next, leave it overnight without

47
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,640
watering to allow the cuts to heal

50
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,920
Now take one spoonful of cinnamon powder

51
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,920

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,800
one liter of boiling water to create a

55
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,800
natural fertilizer solution.

56
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,159
Cover the lid and let it sit overnight

57
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,239

58
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,400
cinnamon powder are fully dissolved in

the

61
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:59,599
breadcrumbs, which are rich in nutrients

62
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,599

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,919
Let it sit overnight to ensure the

82
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,880
Step one, use a soft cotton pad soaked

83
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,560
in the cinnamon water and gently wipe

84
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,560
the top and bottom surfaces of the

85
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,360
leaves. This method helps eliminate

86
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,520
fungi, pests, and harmful insects from

87
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,520
the plant.

88
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,000
This method also cleans the leaves,

89
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,160
allowing them to photosynthesize more

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,960
effectively, which improves the plant's

91
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,960
overall nutrient exchange.

Step two, pour this cinnamon water

95
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,000
solution into a spray bottle.

96
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,360
Then spray the solution over the entire

97
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:41,400
orchid to remove dust, mold, and any

98
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,400
pests clinging to the plant.

99
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,120
This method also stimulates the plant's

100
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,639
natural resistance, helping it grow

101
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,639
stronger and better withstand diseases.

102
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,400
Step three, use a soft cloth to wipe off

103
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,840
any excess water from the leaves to

104
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,840
prevent mold and bacterial growth.

105
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,680
Wiping off water helps the leaves dry

106
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:39,440
quickly, improving the plant's ability

107
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,440
to photosynthesize and exchange

108
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,959
nutrients. Reduces the risk of the

109
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,360
orchid getting sick due to prolonged

110
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,360
damp conditions.

112
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,160
Uh, step four, add a thin layer of moss

113
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,480
on the surface of the orchid pot to to

114
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,270
retain moisture and create a better

115
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:16,840
growing environment for the

118
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,200
maintain moisture balance and prevents

119
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,160
the plant from losing water too quickly

120
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,160
in dry conditions.

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,519
Now I mix the cinnamon water solution

123
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,519
with the breadcrumbs water solution

124
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,519

After mixing, we will have a natural

128
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:18,279
nutrient solution that is excellent for

129
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,279

131
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,950
Step five. From now on, water this

132
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,920

growth of new roots, allowing the plant

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,640
to absorb nutrients more effectively.

138
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,279

You can use the leftover mixture to

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,839
water other regular orchids as well. It

147
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,839

that the orchid is growing healthily.

183
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,519
I will continue to water this natural
