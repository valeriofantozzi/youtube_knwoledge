Hello friends!

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,899
So glad you've come to my channel!

3
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:12,898
What natural methods do you usually take care of orchids?

4
00:00:12,898 --> 00:00:19,897
Please share your experiences with flower lovers in the comments!

5
00:00:19,897 --> 00:00:25,895
Today I continue to introduce to you a new type of organic fertilizer.

6
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:28,028
Let's start.

7
00:00:28,917 --> 00:00:38,893
When orchids are damaged by insects, they cause diseases to spread from insect bites.

8
00:00:39,347 --> 00:00:45,325
And insect bites damage beautiful orchids

9
00:00:55,556 --> 00:01:04,554
Now I will show you how to make a fertilizer that combines insect repellent with a very easy natural method.

10
00:01:04,554 --> 00:01:09,553
In my hand is an orange

11
00:01:09,553 --> 00:01:15,525
I will scrape its shell

12
00:01:15,525 --> 00:01:22,784
Orange peel contains very high levels of vitamin C and essential oils

13
00:01:22,784 --> 00:01:28,016
This gives it excellent antibacterial properties

14
00:01:28,016 --> 00:01:33,882
Will help protect orchids from pests, fungi and bacteria.

15
00:01:42,606 --> 00:01:48,579
You put orange peel in the cup

16
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:08,708
Next, add 1 teaspoon of baking soda to help eliminate insects and equal the PH level in the orchid growing medium

17
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:14,574
Next you need Rice

18
00:02:16,555 --> 00:02:22,539
Add 5 spoons of rice to the cup

19
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:38,036
Then add 2 liters of water

20
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:53,899
Cover and leave for 1 hour before using.

21
00:03:01,135 --> 00:03:04,131
1 Hour Later

22
00:03:26,292 --> 00:03:32,292
Method 1: Clean the leaves with this water.

23
00:03:34,675 --> 00:03:42,656
This helps remove dust and insects from the leaves

24
00:03:46,701 --> 00:03:54,687
Helps clean stomata and helps orchids photosynthesize and synthesize chlorophyll better.

25
00:03:56,491 --> 00:04:02,886
Apply 1-2 times per month.

26
00:04:03,885 --> 00:04:08,884
Method 2: Water this water on the orchid root.

27
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:19,282
This type of liquid fertilizer not only provides nutrients but also helps balance the PH level in the orchid growing medium

28
00:04:24,494 --> 00:04:33,879
and also protects orchid roots from attacks by harmful insects and fungi.

29
00:04:41,109 --> 00:04:50,076
The essential oil in orange peel is very hot, so after watering, take the orchid pot out immediately.

30
00:04:55,234 --> 00:05:02,207
Fertilize your orchid twice a month with this liquid fertilizer.

31
00:05:10,614 --> 00:05:16,604
Then pour this water into a spray bottle

32
00:05:32,535 --> 00:05:38,567
Method 3: spray this water on the entire orchid.

33
00:05:40,688 --> 00:05:46,898
Vitamin C content and essential oils in orange peel

34
00:05:46,898 --> 00:05:55,896
Will help protect plants from fungus, bacteria or harmful insects.

35
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:06,994
You do not need to use chemical pesticides.

36
00:06:06,994 --> 00:06:13,246
Helps protect a clean, green living environment.

37
00:06:18,426 --> 00:06:26,424
Orange peel also contains a lot of calcium, potassium and some biological compounds

38
00:06:26,424 --> 00:06:33,889
Necessary for growth and stimulation of orchids flowering.

39
00:06:35,807 --> 00:06:43,887
You can also spray this fertilizer on your flowers to help protect them from harmful insects.

40
00:06:47,852 --> 00:06:52,885
Fertilize your orchids 1-2 times a month.

41
00:06:58,424 --> 00:07:00,424
Result

42
00:07:00,424 --> 00:07:08,415
Orchids are protected from pests and are provided with enough nutrients so their leaves are always green.

43
00:07:13,143 --> 00:07:23,112
The nutrient content in this fertilizer is abundant so the buds grow very large and strong.

44
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:50,007
Flowers bloom brightly and stay fresh for a long time

45
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:13,869
When orchids are provided with enough nutrition, the flowers will stick on the branches for a long time before fading

46
00:08:29,955 --> 00:08:39,931
These orchids of mine can be kept on branches for up to 6 months before blooming.

47
00:08:43,635 --> 00:08:52,895
If you want Phalaenopsis orchids to bloom for a long time, you need to place the plant in a place with a temperature of 15 - 20 degrees Celsius.

48
00:08:56,874 --> 00:09:06,859
Where the temperature is 30 degrees Celsius or higher, Phalaenopsis orchids will quickly wilt

49
00:09:15,057 --> 00:09:25,055
