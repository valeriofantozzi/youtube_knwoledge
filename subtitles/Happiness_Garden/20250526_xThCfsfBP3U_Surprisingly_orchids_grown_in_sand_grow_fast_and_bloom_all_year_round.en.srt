00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,879

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,020

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:55,120

prevents harmful bacteria and fungi,

Then soak the sand in cinnamon water for

177

178
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,600
can absorb water and nutrients more

179
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:21,079

181
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,560
The growth of new roots also creates a

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,440
strong foundation for the orchid to

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,560
Rooting weak orchids in sand stimulates

186
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,480
quick new root growth, but we should

187
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,639
avoid keeping them in sand for too long

188
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,360
as it can cause root rot and damage due

189
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,360
to poor air circulation.

191
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,680
Therefore, you need to plant the orchid

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,760
into a new pot using mediums like pine

199
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,160
After planting, you need to secure the

200
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,199
orchid stem to a ST to keep the plant

201
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,680
stable, reduce movement from wind or

202
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:21,070
handling, which helps the roots firmly

203
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:27,959
attach to the medium and grow stronger.

205
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,680
If you are busy, you can use slowrelease

206
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,680
fertilizer designed for

207
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:42,000
orchids. Um, this type of fertilizer

208
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,839
gradually supplies nutrients over a long

209
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,470

210
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:51,680

However, if you're not too busy, I

213
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,240
recommend using natural fertilizers.

214
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,320
These are environmentally friendly and

215
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,959
help orchids grow well and sustainably

over

217
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:08,839

218
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,839
and maintain moisture for the orchid.

Depending on the weather conditions, I

221
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,839
usually water the orchid once every one

222
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:24,600
to two weeks to ensure the plant is

223
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,600
neither too dry nor water logged.

a spot with gentle sunlight to allow the

227
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,240
orchid to

00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,690
