Hello everyone, today I share a simple and easy way to care for orchids at home

2
00:00:09,899 --> 00:00:16,897
Helps plants grow quickly and always have lots of flower buds

3
00:00:18,897 --> 00:00:24,896
The flowers will stay on the branches longer.

4
00:00:24,896 --> 00:00:30,894
so that orchids grow quickly and are healthy and lush

5
00:00:30,894 --> 00:00:33,894
and blooms beautifully all year round

6
00:00:34,894 --> 00:00:44,892
Once every 10 days, water the plant.

7
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:56,889
This method will help orchids grow very quickly and healthy.

8
00:01:04,888 --> 00:01:14,886
Soak the potted plant in water for 20 minutes.

9
00:01:14,886 --> 00:01:19,885
then take it out.

10
00:01:22,884 --> 00:01:32,882
I used 1 okra, which contains a lot of nutrients.

11
00:01:36,881 --> 00:01:44,880
Helps orchids grow very quickly.

12
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:56,877
It positively affects the growth of leaves, branches and flowers.

13
00:02:00,877 --> 00:02:08,875
Helps plants take root quickly and flower abundantly

14
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:32,870
Add 200ml of water and wait 30 minutes before using.

15
00:02:45,868 --> 00:02:55,899
When orchids are purchased or have been grown for a long time without flowers.

16
00:03:01,898 --> 00:03:08,896
You should repot the plant.

17
00:03:12,896 --> 00:03:22,894
Remove all old planting material.

18
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:46,889
Then cut off all damaged roots.

19
00:03:48,888 --> 00:03:58,887
The roots are damaged to the point that the leaves wilt.

20
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:36,879
After soaking for 30 minutes, okra gel will form.

21
00:04:41,878 --> 00:04:47,877
Please use this water.

22
00:04:48,877 --> 00:04:58,875
Cleans the leaves, helping to remove dirt.

23
00:05:02,874 --> 00:05:10,872
and helps plants grow better when replanted.

24
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:26,869
Then add the onion peel water.

25
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:46,898
Then filter out the residue.

26
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:08,894
Mix with 2 liters of water.

27
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:32,889
Then soak the entire root in okra gel solution for about 30 minutes.

28
00:06:37,888 --> 00:06:46,887
This helps new roots grow faster..

29
00:06:51,886 --> 00:07:00,884
Then water this water at the base of the tree.

30
00:07:00,884 --> 00:07:08,882
You should apply this method every 2 weeks

31
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:28,878
Use this water to spray on the leaves.

32
00:07:30,878 --> 00:07:39,876
Helps prevent mealybugs, thrips, and spiders from sticking to orchid leaves.

33
00:07:41,876 --> 00:07:50,874
Okra gel has adhesion and antibacterial and antiseptic properties.

34
00:07:50,874 --> 00:07:56,873
Helps plants to be protected and healthier.

35
00:08:00,872 --> 00:08:09,870
The tree will continuously develop new roots very quickly.

36
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:22,868
Roots help absorb nutrients fastest and best

37
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:32,899
Helps weak plants quickly recover and grow strongly again.

38
00:08:46,896 --> 00:08:51,895
Now take it out and plant it in a pot.

39
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:03,893
I use pine bark as a substrate that has been sterilized to treat fungal diseases

40
00:09:08,892 --> 00:09:18,890
I have created a lot of subtitles, you can view and choose the appropriate language.

41
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:39,886
After planting, water just enough to keep it moist.
