tips you can see that this Orchid hasn't

130
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:27,600
grown for 6 months its leaves are

131
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:31,160
gradually wilting the roots are rotting

132
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,160
and the plant is on the brink of

133
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,079
dying have you ever encountered a

134
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,440
similar situation and didn't know what

135
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:44,440
to do to save your beloved

136
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:52,279
Orchid uh first I'll carefully remove

137
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,079
all the wilted and damaged leaves this

138
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:56,440
is important because unhealthy leaves

139
00:12:54,079 --> 00:13:00,399
can drain the plant's energy hindering

140
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,399
its recovery and growth

141
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,000
next I'll cut off all the damaged Roots

142
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,959
this is essential because rotten Roots

143
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,240
can spread Decay to healthy parts of the

144
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:20,970
plant preventing it from from absorbing

145
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:36,600
nutrients properly

[Music]

147
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,920
uh finally I'll cut off any old flower

148
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,800
stems if present this helps the plant

149
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,800
Focus its energy on New Growth rather

150
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:51,920

this is moss for planting orchids I put

205
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,559
it into the

206
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:28,360

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,760
soaking the Moss before planting orchids

209
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,919
helps eliminate harmful bacteria and

210
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:41,840
mold while providing a clean and safe

211
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,840
environment for the orchid's roots to

212
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:48,919

213
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,919
it to plant the

214
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:59,720

215
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:01,960

219
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,280
keep the rice water to make a liquid

220
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,280

water for 20 minutes this helps

225
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,240

soak it in the rice water and gently

232
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,840
wipe the leaves to help revive wilted

233
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,880

234
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:48,880

place the Orchid pot in a spot with with

268
