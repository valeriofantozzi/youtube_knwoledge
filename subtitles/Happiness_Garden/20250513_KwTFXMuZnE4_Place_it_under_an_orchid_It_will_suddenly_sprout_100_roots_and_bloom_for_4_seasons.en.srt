Hello everyone. Welcome to the Happiness

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,240
Garden

00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:08,080
channel. Today I will share a great tip

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,800
for taking care of orchids after the

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,240
flowers have

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,080
faded. This method is especially

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,600
effective in helping wilted or weak

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,039
orchids recover and grow

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,359
quickly. This Phelinopsis orchid has

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,400
finished blooming but became wilted and

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,760
stunted, so it was

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,320
removed. I picked it up with the hope of

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,760
reviving it and helping it grow strong

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,009
again.

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,719
And now I will show you how to revive

you as a companion on this orchid care

22
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:53,559
journey. Thank you so much for watching

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,559
and sharing this passion with me.

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,600
First, we need to remove the yellowing

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,680
and damaged leaves from the orchid. Um,

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,520
this helps the plant focus its energy on

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,400
healthier parts and prevents diseases

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,529
from spreading through the damaged

29
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,529
[Music]

30
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,720
leaves. Then, we need to check the roots

31
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,119
and the orchid's growing medium as after

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,159
the flowers fade, the plant often goes

33
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,130
through a resting phase or prepares for

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,159
a new growth cycle.

35
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,720
[Music]

36
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,040
Due to the growing medium too wet, many

37
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,600
of the orchids roots were damaged,

38
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,040
resulting in the plant being unable to

39
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,240
absorb enough water and

40
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,840
nutrients. This caused the orchid's

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,119
leaves to start wilting, and the plant

42
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,200
became weak.

43
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,840
To fix this issue, we need to remove the

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,520
old growing medium and replace it with a

45
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,439
new one, ensuring that the orchid's

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,520
environment is well ventilated and not

47
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,040
water logged, allowing the roots to grow

48
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,040
healthily and the plant to recover

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,040
quickly.

50
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,920
[Music]

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,080
Next, cut off the damaged roots to stop

52
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,760
the growth of fungi and bacteria while

53
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,239
also creating space for new healthy

54
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,239
roots to

55
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,200
grow. Uh, this step not only helps the

56
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,879
orchid recover faster, but also allows

57
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,760
the plant to absorb nutrients better

58
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,760
from the new growing medium.

59
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,160
Next, cut off the wilted flower stalks

60
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,720
to help the plant focus its energy on

61
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:41,480
developing new leaves and roots rather

62
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,480
than nourishing the spent flower stems.

63
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,040
Next, we wash the orchid with water to

64
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,879
remove dust, fungus residues, bacteria,

65
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,879
or any impurities that could harm the

66
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:09,599
plant. Um, in addition to the English

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,800

next

79
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:41,440
step. Next, take one aloe vera leaf to

80
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,440
make a natural fertilizer to revive the

81
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,440
orchid.

82
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,680
Aloe vera has antibacterial properties,

83
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,000
helping the orchid recover quickly and

84
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,000
grow

85
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,519
healthily. Put the aloe vera leaf into

86
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,560
300 ml of water and blend it to create a

87
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,560
natural fertilizer solution.

89
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,759
After blending, strain it through a

90
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,759
sieve to remove the coarse fibers. ers

91
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,000
leaving only the aloe vera gel mixed

92
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,000
with

93
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,880
water. After straining, dilute it with

94
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,240
an additional 0.7 lers of water to get

95
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,240
one liter of aloe vera

96
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:31,440
solution. Next, I add three vitamin B1

97
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,800
tablets to the aloe vera solution to

98
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,800
enhance the recovery effect for the

99
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,800
orchid.

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,759

this mixture and gently wipe both the

103
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,840

104
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,840

plant's recovery and growth process.

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,479
After wiping the leaves, soak the entire

115
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,479
orchid in this mixture for about 20

116
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,479
minutes.

117
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,199
Soaking helps the roots absorb the

118
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,599
maximum nutrients from the aloe vera and

119
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,520
vitamin B1, supporting the stimulation

120
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,919
of new root growth and the recovery of

121
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,919
damaged cells.

122
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,120
During the soaking time, you should

123
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,879
place the plant in a cool area, avoiding

124
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,879
direct sunlight to prevent thermal

125
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:05,599
shock. Next, we need to prepare the new

126
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,599
growing medium before

127
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:11,199
planting. I use pine bark chips for

128
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,440
planting orchids because pine bark chips

129
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:17,639
are breathable and retain moisture well,

130
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,639
helping the orchid grow healthily.

131
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,120
And I add a little moss to spread on top

132
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,440
of the orchid pot, helping to retain

133
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,400
moisture better and create a breathable

134
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,400
environment for the plant's

135
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:42,680
roots. Then pour boiling water over the

136
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,680
pine bark chips and soak the moss.

137
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,160
This helps sterilize and remove harmful

138
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:49,680

139
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,720

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,639
evenly distributed around the roots and

222
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,890

out and place it in a spot with gentle

239
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:30,480
after 3 months of reviving the wilted

240
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:32,720
orchid. You can see that the orchid has

241
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,920
become healthy again with strong root

242
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,920
growth and lush green

243
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,279
leaves. Um, although the bottom leaves

244
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,199
are still wilted and soft, once the

245
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,600
orchid has a healthy root system that

246
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,760
absorbs enough water and nutrients, it

247
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,760
will gradually recover and begin to grow

248
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,760

In addition to recovering wilted leaves,

252
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,440
the orchid has also grown two new

253
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,360
leaves. This is a very positive sign

254
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,040
that the plant is developing well and

255
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,040
adapting successfully to its new

healthy, bright white and plump,

260
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,720

they provide a strong foundation for the

266
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:53,000
plant to continue producing new leaves

267
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,000

the liquid fertilizer mixture made from

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,399

274
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:21,000
stronger roots, lush green leaves, and

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,000
readiness for the next blooming phase.

276
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,360
Regular fertilization helps the plant

281
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,080
