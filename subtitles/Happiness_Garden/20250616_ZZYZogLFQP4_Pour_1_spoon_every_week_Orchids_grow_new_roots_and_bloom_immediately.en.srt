[Music]

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,600
To start making natural fertilizer,

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,720
simply take one liter of warm water and

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,720
pour it into a clean bottle.

[Music]

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,200
The first ingredient you need to add is

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,360
molasses. This is a natural sugar source

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,520
rich in minerals that helps nourish

33
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,080
beneficial microorganisms in the

34
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,240
fertilizer.

35
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,000
With just one teaspoon of molasses, you

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,680
create the ideal conditions for the

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,680
fermentation process to occur naturally.

This type of sugar not only activates

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,840
beneficial microorganisms but also helps

41
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,840
create a nutrient-rich environment that

42
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,760
supports orchid roots to grow quickly,

The next ingredient you need to prepare

46
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,920
is oatmeal. It is a natural and healthy

47
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,319
source of starch that when combined with

48
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,680
molasses creates an ideal environment

49
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,520
for beneficial microorganisms to thrive.

51
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,800
Just add 3 tsp of oatmeal to the bottle

52
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,800
and that's enough.

53
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,400
Then stir well to dissolve the oatmeal

54
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:30,320
evenly in the water, making the

55
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:33,470
fermentation process smoother.

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,120
During this time, the microorganisms

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,879
will begin to work, transforming the

62
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,290

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,400
The first method is to use a soft cloth

impurities that have accumulated on the

leaf surface.

When sprayed evenly on both leaf

158
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,720

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,960
the plant absorb nutrients more quickly

160
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,800

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,199

and come into direct contact with the

189

Regularly watering the orchid base

194
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,399
enriches the microbial community,

195
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,240
promotes the decomposition of organic

196
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,839
matter in the growing medium, and

197
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,399
suppresses the growth of harmful

198
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,090
bacteria and fungi, helping the orchid

199
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,679

Uh, orchid roots are the primary site

203
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,399
for nutrient absorption. So, when

204
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,040
nourished with a natural fertilizer rich

205
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,040
in enzymes and easily digestible sugars,

206
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,040

thicker.

208
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,080
A healthy root system is the solid

209
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,600
foundation for vigorous plant growth and

210
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,600
proper preparation for the blooming

the growing medium retains just the

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,760
right amount of moisture and becomes

216
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,519
more airrated thanks to the gentle

217
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,519
decomposition activity of the

219
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,600
After watering, you can also soak the

entire orchid pot in the mixture for

221
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,140
about 20 minutes. Soaking allows the

222
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:30,330
roots to absorb more nutrients.

the roots airy and healthy.

231
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,240
After that, use a soft cloth to absorb

Standing water in the leaf axles or

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,279
orchid crown can easily become a

237
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,839
breeding ground for fungi and bacteria,

238
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:18,360
leading to leaf or crown rot, especially

239
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,360
in humid weather or during the night.

240
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,200
Timely drying helps the plant avoid

241
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:27,720
these dangerous diseases, keeping the

242
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,720

Wiping off standing water also helps

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,399
keep the orchid clean, preventing

246
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,640
yellowing or discoloration on the leaves

247
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,600
caused by residue left behind as the

248
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,079
water evaporates.

249
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,600
At the same time, a well- ventilated dry

250
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,399
environment will limit the development

251
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,839
of white mold, black mold, and other

252
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,839
diseases that spread through high

humidity.

254
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,440
Fermented fertilizer should be applied

255
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,440
in the morning. This is when the orchid

256
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,160
begins its most active metabolic

257
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,680
processes of the day, allowing it to

258
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,920
absorb nutrients more effectively.

259
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,240
At the same time, sunlight helps the

260
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,079
leaves and roots dry quickly, reducing

261
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,079
the risk of fungal infections or root

262
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,079
rot.

263
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,639
And finally, remember to place the

264
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,079
orchid pot in a spot with gentle

265
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,480
sunlight so the plant can

266
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,639
photosynthesize well.

267
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,800
When exposed to natural light, orchids

268
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,120
can convert nutrients into energy,

269
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:35,880
allowing them to absorb fertilizer more

270
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,880
