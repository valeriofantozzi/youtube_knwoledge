00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
Hello friends! How are you?

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:10,898
In this video, I continue to share natural fertilizers that are easy to make from things in the kitchen

3
00:00:10,898 --> 00:00:18,897
Help your orchids grow strongly and bloom continuously.

5
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:45,891
Let's get started!

6
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:52,890
To make this fertilizer I need bananas.

7
00:01:00,888 --> 00:01:08,887
Banana peels contain a lot of potassium, phosphorus and nitrogen, essential elements for plant growth. 

8
00:01:08,887 --> 00:01:16,885
Potassium helps enhance resistance and flowering ability.

9
00:01:18,885 --> 00:01:28,883
Compounds in banana peels help plants resist pests and mold.

10
00:01:47,798 --> 00:01:57,796
Cut banana peel into small pieces.

11
00:02:00,877 --> 00:02:10,875
Banana peel is a natural material, easy to find and environmentally friendly, 

12
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:16,873
helps you reduce waste.

13
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:23,872
This is aloe vera leaf.

14
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:31,870
Aloe vera contains many vitamins and minerals, 

15
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:38,869
helping to increase the plant's resistance.

16
00:02:42,868 --> 00:02:50,900
Cut aloe vera into small slices.

17
00:02:58,898 --> 00:03:08,896
Then add aloe vera and banana peel into the jar.

18
00:03:55,887 --> 00:04:00,886
Next I need beer.

19
00:04:08,885 --> 00:04:18,883
Take 100ml of beer, which is equivalent to about 7 tablespoons.

20
00:04:19,882 --> 00:04:26,881
Beer after fermentation helps prevent aloe vera and banana peels from rotting

21
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:32,880
Beer contains sugar and carbohydrates, 

22
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,879
which help provide energy to plants, promoting growth and flowering.

23
00:04:40,878 --> 00:04:48,877
Add 2 cups of warm water (about 500ml) to help GE ferment better.

24
00:04:52,876 --> 00:05:00,874
The vitamins in beer can support metabolism in plants.

25
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,869
Use cotton to cover the hole in the bottle cap. 

26
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:36,867
Helps prevent bacteria and mold from entering the GE during fermentation.

27
00:06:08,894 --> 00:06:18,892
Place in a cool place and incubate for 3 weeks.

28
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:33,889
3 Weeks Later.

29
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:42,888
This is a GE jar made from banana peels and aloe vera that I made 3 weeks ago.

30
00:06:52,886 --> 00:06:59,884
Take 20ml of this GE (about more than 1 tablespoon).

31
00:07:06,883 --> 00:07:12,882
Add 1 liter of water (about 1 liter).

32
00:07:33,877 --> 00:07:41,876
When the roots are silvery white like this, we need to water the orchid.

33
00:07:59,872 --> 00:08:06,871
Use this water to water orchid roots.

34
00:08:08,871 --> 00:08:16,869
GE made from banana peels and aloe vera helps improve soil structure 

35
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:22,868
and retain moisture for plant roots.

36
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:36,898
Nutrients help roots grow healthily, allowing the plant to absorb nutrients better.

37
00:08:40,898 --> 00:08:50,896
When combining two types of banana peel and aloe vera to make GE, 

38
00:08:50,896 --> 00:09:00,894
You will provide a rich source of nutrients for the orchid, helping the plant develop comprehensively.

39
00:09:09,892 --> 00:09:19,890
Banana peel adds potassium and phosphorus, while aloe vera adds vitamins and moisture, 

40
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:29,888
creates a perfect formula for plant growth.

41
00:09:33,887 --> 00:09:43,885
Doing this 1-2 times a month or combining it with other organic fertilizers will help orchids develop comprehensively.

42
00:09:46,585 --> 00:09:56,882
Remember that GE organic fertilizer made from aloe vera and banana peels is great. 

43
00:09:56,882 --> 00:10:06,881
But if the orchid does not absorb enough light, the orchid will not grow.

44
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:19,878
Soaking the roots in this water for 20 minutes helps the orchid absorb nutrients better.

45
00:10:22,877 --> 00:10:32,875
When the substrate is still moist and the roots are still green like this, you do not need to water the orchid.

46
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:37,874
If you water too much, the roots can easily rot.

47
00:10:42,873 --> 00:10:52,871
While the orchid is absorbing moisture and nutrients, we can take advantage of this time to take care of the plant's leaves.

48
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:06,869
Do you see any white streaks left on the leaves from the spray?

49
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:29,897
While the orchid is absorbing moisture and nutrients, we can take advantage of this time to take care of the plant's leaves.

50
00:11:35,918 --> 00:11:45,894
Wiping leaves with tea water not only cleans dirt and dust, 

51
00:11:45,894 --> 00:11:55,892
but also provides nutrients to the plant through the leaves.

52
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:15,888
Be sure to clean the undersides of leaves as well because that's where pests like to hide.

53
00:12:15,888 --> 00:12:25,886
Look how green and shiny the leaves are after cleaning!

54
00:12:30,885 --> 00:12:40,883
This method not only cleans the leaf surface but also provides nutrients through the leaves to the orchid.

55
00:12:45,882 --> 00:12:55,880
After cleaning, the orchid's photosynthetic organs will function better.

56
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:08,878
Helps improve orchids' metabolism.

57
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:26,874
Do this 1-2 times a month to keep the orchids protected.

58
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:53,869
Now put this water in a spray bottle.

59
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:28,895
Banana peel solution is not only great for watering orchids but can also be used to mist them.

60
00:14:33,894 --> 00:14:43,892
This helps provide nutrients, freshen the leaves, increase humidity and clean dust from the leaves.

61
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:58,889
You can mist orchids once a week with this GE water.

62
00:15:03,888 --> 00:15:13,886
On weekdays, you only need to spray water regularly when you see the roots turn silvery white.

63
00:15:17,886 --> 00:15:27,884
Treat your plants with love and they will repay you with lush green leaves and blooming flowers.

64
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:48,880
