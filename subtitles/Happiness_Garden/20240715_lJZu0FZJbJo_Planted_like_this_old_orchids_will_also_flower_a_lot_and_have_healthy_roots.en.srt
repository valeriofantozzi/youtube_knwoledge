00:00:28,464 --> 00:00:33,461
welcome to my channel

2
00:00:35,695 --> 00:00:42,692
Today I show you how to propagate orchids at home from flower branches

3
00:01:03,868 --> 00:01:27,545
Peel off the cover to make sprouts easy to grow

4
00:01:56,536 --> 00:02:04,115
Apply molten candle solution to the cut

5
00:02:05,342 --> 00:02:13,338
Doing so will not allow water to seep into the branches.

6
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:23,826
At the same time, it helps the orchid not to lose water.

7
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:34,753
Helps protect orchid branches from rot

8
00:02:46,091 --> 00:03:02,373
Use 2 small cloves of garlic

9
00:03:09,283 --> 00:03:13,515
add 1 liter of water at room temperature

10
00:03:15,476 --> 00:03:19,596
puree

11
00:03:24,322 --> 00:03:26,900
filter out residue

12
00:03:31,385 --> 00:03:40,303
Soak orchid branches in garlic water for 20 minutes

13
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:57,700
Garlic contains a number of natural hormones that stimulate the growth of sprouts and roots

14
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:10,811
Soak moss in garlic water for 20 minutes

15
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:22,613
Garlic contains sulfur compounds and natural antibiotics, which help prevent the growth of harmful bacteria and pests that exist in orchid media.

16
00:04:32,969 --> 00:04:40,659
AFTER 20 MINUTES

17
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:03,734
I recycle plastic boxes as orchid propagating tools

18
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:59,442
Put the orchid branch here and remember to put the sprout facing up

19
00:06:11,196 --> 00:06:15,874
Put in a cool place for the orchid to revive

20
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:32,461
AFTER 2 WEEKS

21
00:06:34,158 --> 00:06:38,836
Sprouts have grown a bit

22
00:06:45,128 --> 00:06:47,128
Keep misting to keep moisture regularly

23
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:07,562
Continue to put it in a shady place to wait for the tree to revive

24
00:07:15,641 --> 00:07:19,761
AFTER 3 MONTHS

25
00:07:21,211 --> 00:07:23,211
WOW

26
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:31,152
The orchid has grown into a very healthy seedling

27
00:07:55,295 --> 00:08:07,114
The roots are very big and strong

28
00:08:07,114 --> 00:08:15,828
So with only garlic bulbs, we can propagate orchids at home very easily

29
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:24,484
We don't need to use chemical drugs

30
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:31,025
In order for the plant to be perennial and not have root rot, I will replant it later

31
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:43,133
I planted with pine bark and pumice stone so that the roots of the orchid can be ventilated

32
00:09:00,626 --> 00:09:21,372
Just put the orchid on and water to keep it moist

33
00:09:22,483 --> 00:09:31,513
From now on you can take care of it like any other orchid

34
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:15,879
There are many different ways to revive old, wilted, or rootless orchids like this

35
00:10:24,877 --> 00:10:33,875
This video will add a new way for you to have more choices

36
00:10:50,872 --> 00:11:00,870
Cut off all damaged roots

37
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:17,888
Rinse with water

38
00:12:23,886 --> 00:12:33,885
Use 1 clove of garlic

39
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:08,878
300ml of water at room temperature

40
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:22,875
Puree

41
00:13:38,872 --> 00:13:46,870
Filter out residue

42
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:56,868
add 700ml of water

43
00:13:58,868 --> 00:14:06,899
Soak orchid branches in garlic water for 30 minutes

44
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:25,896
After soaking for 30 minutes, take it out and dry it

45
00:14:40,893 --> 00:14:50,891
Sprinkle cinnamon powder on the cut and orchid root

46
00:14:52,890 --> 00:15:02,888
This helps the cut to heal quickly and is highly resistant to rot

47
00:15:07,887 --> 00:15:16,886
Use bricks with holes like this

48
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:26,884
then you recycle 5 liter plastic bottles like i do here

49
00:15:34,882 --> 00:15:46,880
Add water like I do

50
00:16:02,876 --> 00:16:12,874
Plug the orchid branch into the hole of the building brick

51
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:25,872
2 days misting 1 time

52
00:16:26,872 --> 00:16:36,870
Place it next to a window or a place with light

53
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:46,868
but avoid direct sunlight

54
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:52,900
45 Days Later

55
00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:06,897
Orchids have developed very healthy roots

56
00:17:09,897 --> 00:17:15,895
In this way,

57
00:17:17,895 --> 00:17:27,893
bricks do the job of absorbing water and keeping moisture very well

58
00:17:29,893 --> 00:17:32,892
Therefore,

59
00:17:32,892 --> 00:17:43,890
it will create a favorable environment for orchids to recover

60
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:48,889
 and grow very well

61
00:17:50,888 --> 00:17:59,887
From now on, spray organic foliar fertilizer once a week like I shared on the channel.

62
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:11,884
AFTER THE NEXT 3 MONTHS

63
00:18:16,883 --> 00:18:26,881
With a very good orchid growing environment, the orchids recovered and grew quickly.

64
00:18:38,879 --> 00:18:48,877
From leaves to roots and flower buds grow wonderfully.

65
00:18:55,876 --> 00:19:02,874
Many flower buds grow at the same time.

66
00:19:08,873 --> 00:19:18,871
Only healthy orchids produce so many flower buds at the same time.

67
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:30,869
Hopefully the video will help you a lot in taking better care of orchids at home.

Welcome to part 3 of this video

71
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:39,888
When orchids are old and have poor resistance, we need to rejuvenate them.

72
00:20:48,886 --> 00:20:58,884
First you need to cut off all damaged leaves and roots.

73
00:21:53,874 --> 00:21:58,873
Keep only fresh roots.

74
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:20,868
Onions have very good antiseptic and growth stimulating effects

75
00:22:50,896 --> 00:23:00,894
Take about 20 grams of thinly sliced ​​onion.

76
00:23:08,892 --> 00:23:13,891
Take 1 teaspoon of baking soda.

77
00:23:13,891 --> 00:23:20,890
Helps balance PH levels and eliminate fungal diseases harmful to orchids

78
00:23:23,889 --> 00:23:33,887
Add 2 liters of water at room temperature.

79
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:45,885
Wait 30 minutes before using

80
00:23:52,883 --> 00:24:02,881
After 30 minutes, filter to remove residue

81
00:24:31,876 --> 00:24:41,874
Then water the orchid with onion water and baking soda

82
00:25:13,867 --> 00:25:23,899
Soak in this water for 30 minutes

83
00:25:54,893 --> 00:26:04,891
Cover the pot with a layer of dry moss

84
00:26:19,888 --> 00:26:29,886
Place the dried moss in this transparent plastic box

85
00:26:43,883 --> 00:26:52,881
Leave in a cool place for 1 day without watering

86
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,879
1 Day later

87
00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:13,877
From now on, water your orchids once a week

88
00:27:17,876 --> 00:27:25,875
Or water when the moss is dry

89
00:27:32,873 --> 00:27:42,871
Be careful to keep the moss moist. If the moss is waterlogged, the orchid will easily rot.

90
00:27:52,869 --> 00:28:02,867
Then place it in a cool place with enough light for the orchid to grow

91
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:16,898
3 Weeks Later

92
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:06,888
Many baby orchids have sprouted

93
00:29:25,884 --> 00:29:30,883
Take 2 liters of water at room temperature

94
00:29:34,882 --> 00:29:44,880
Then add 5 spoons of rice

95
00:30:03,877 --> 00:30:13,875
Water the orchid with rice water once a week

96
00:30:15,874 --> 00:30:25,872
Helps stimulate baby orchids to grow and take root quickly

97
00:30:32,871 --> 00:30:42,869
Continue to place in a cool, well-lit place for the orchid to grow

98
00:30:52,900 --> 00:31:00,899
After the next 1 month

99
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:10,897
The baby orchids grow very healthy.

100
00:31:18,895 --> 00:31:28,893
Newly growing roots will help the orchid absorb the most nutrients

101
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:51,888
From now on, you can add other organic fertilizers to your orchids such as fish protein or soybean fertilizer to help your orchids grow faster

102
00:32:06,886 --> 00:32:11,885
After 4 months orchids will bloom throughout the garden

103
00:32:12,884 --> 00:32:19,883
