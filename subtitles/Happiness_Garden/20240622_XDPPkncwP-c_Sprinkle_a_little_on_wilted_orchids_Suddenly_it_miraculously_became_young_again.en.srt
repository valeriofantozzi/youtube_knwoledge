00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,233
Hello friends.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,899
Nice to meet you on my channel.

3
00:00:08,899 --> 00:00:15,897
You see here a withered orchid.

4
00:00:15,897 --> 00:00:22,896
Maybe it's because you didn't water it.

5
00:00:22,896 --> 00:00:31,894
or due to direct sunlight shining on the orchid.

6
00:00:31,894 --> 00:00:40,892
If you want orchids to be nourished and grow quickly.

7
00:00:40,892 --> 00:00:47,891
Please watch this video carefully.

8
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:55,490
Now I will share this amazing trick with you.

9
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:14,886
You need 1 aloe vera leaf.

10
00:01:14,886 --> 00:01:28,883
This aloe vera gel is great for reviving orchids.

11
00:01:28,883 --> 00:01:43,880
Now apply aloe vera gel on the top and bottom of the leaf.

12
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:54,878
Aloe vera gel has a very good moisturizing effect.

13
00:01:54,878 --> 00:02:06,875
In addition, aloe vera also contains vitamins A, B, and C

14
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:18,873
and minerals such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.

15
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:30,871
Do this every 5 days and leave the orchid pot in a cool place for 3 weeks.

16
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:43,868
Next, take 1 liter of warm water and put it in the bottle.

17
00:02:43,868 --> 00:03:00,898
Then take 1 spoon of rice and soak it in this water for about 30 minutes.

18
00:03:00,898 --> 00:03:11,896
Let the nutrients in the rice completely dissolve into the water.

19
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:21,894
Chop the remaining aloe vera leaves into small pieces.

20
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:50,888
Then puree with 300ml of water.

21
00:04:06,885 --> 00:04:18,883
Filter out residue half past four Add 2 liters of water at room temperature.

22
00:04:42,956 --> 00:04:54,942
After soaking for 30 minutes, filter this rice water.

23
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:16,871
Mix rice water with aloe vera juice.

24
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:29,868
So I ended up with about 3 liters of this wonderful liquid manure solution.

25
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:09,894
Cover the pot with moss to retain moisture better.

26
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:32,889
Now you use this solution to water the orchid every 5 days.

27
00:06:47,886 --> 00:06:57,884
Soak the orchid pot in this water for 2 hours.

28
00:07:02,981 --> 00:07:12,948
After soaking for 2 hours, remember to lift the orchid pot and place it in a cool place to let the orchid recover.

29
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,879
2 WEEKS LATER.

30
00:07:29,878 --> 00:07:36,877
Fertilize after 2 weeks for fresher orchid leaves.

31
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:46,875
New roots develop very well.

32
00:07:50,874 --> 00:07:59,872
Many new roots are growing.

33
00:08:04,871 --> 00:08:14,869
New roots will help transport water and nutrients from the roots to the stem.

34
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:24,867
If the leaves are provided with enough water and nutrients from the roots,

35
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:32,899
The leaves will gradually become lush again.

36
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:42,897
1 MONTH LATER.

37
00:08:45,896 --> 00:08:55,894
You see the leaves are very fresh.

38
00:09:14,891 --> 00:09:24,889
and the orchid grows a new leaf.

39
00:09:34,887 --> 00:09:38,886
after the next 2 months

40
00:09:39,886 --> 00:09:50,883
The orchid has grown two branches (two buds).

41
00:09:52,883 --> 00:10:02,881
But the leaves at the base have turned yellow so I will cut off these yellow leaves.

42
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:16,878
Instinctively, when an orchid buds, if the plant lacks nutrients,

43
00:10:16,878 --> 00:10:26,876
the base leaves will turn yellow and fall off to provide nutrients for the buds to develop.

44
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:42,873
Now I need to supplement the orchid's nutrition by taking 3 spoons of rice.

45
00:10:47,872 --> 00:10:56,870
Then soak in 2 liters of water at room temperature

46
00:10:58,026 --> 00:11:06,868
and wait 30 minutes for the nutrients to completely dissolve in water before using.

47
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:12,734
30 Minutes Later

48
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:26,898
Add 3 tablespoons of milk

49
00:11:33,896 --> 00:11:43,894
Rice water and milk are excellent sources of nutrients for orchids to grow

50
00:11:50,893 --> 00:12:00,891
Now you water the orchid with this solution once a week to help the orchid recover quickly.

51
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:22,887
After the next 1 month.

52
00:12:28,886 --> 00:12:38,884
After 3-4 times of applying liquid fertilizer from milk and rice water, the orchid had many roots.

53
00:12:39,883 --> 00:12:47,882
Hope the video will help you a lot.

54
00:13:06,345 --> 00:13:16,343
Next, I share how to make orchids bloom at the same time with many flower branches.

55
00:13:19,342 --> 00:13:29,340
Orchids after flowers fade.

56
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:40,338
We cut off all the spent flower stems.

57
00:13:43,387 --> 00:13:52,369
If the plant has never bloomed, it must have 3 or more pairs of leaves.

58
00:13:53,369 --> 00:14:00,368
and healthy roots.

59
00:14:10,619 --> 00:14:20,597
Sprinkle cinnamon powder on the wound to help it heal quickly.

60
00:14:28,595 --> 00:14:35,594
Then wait 1 day for the cut to dry.

61
00:14:47,592 --> 00:14:57,889
Then take 1/2 small onion and cut it into thin slices.

62
00:15:15,886 --> 00:15:25,884
Add 1 liter of water and bring to a boil.

63
00:15:28,883 --> 00:15:32,883
Wait a day then use.

64
00:15:41,881 --> 00:15:51,879
Next take 3 spoons of rice.

65
00:15:53,878 --> 00:16:03,876
Then soak in 1 liter of water and leave for 1 day before using.

66
00:16:20,873 --> 00:16:30,871
After a day, filter out the residue.

67
00:16:46,868 --> 00:16:56,899
Mix the two types together.

68
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:12,896
Clean the leaves with this water.

69
00:17:15,896 --> 00:17:25,894
Helps eliminate fungi and bacteria to help orchids grow better.

70
00:17:25,894 --> 00:17:31,892
Do it once a week.

71
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:47,889
Then use this water to water the orchid roots.

72
00:17:54,888 --> 00:18:03,886
This will help stimulate root and flower stem growth.

73
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:12,884
Do it once a week.

74
00:18:21,882 --> 00:18:31,880
Place cotton balls between 2 leaves

75
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:06,874
Then spray this water on the cotton pad.

76
00:19:07,873 --> 00:19:15,872
This stimulates flower stems to grow.

77
00:19:18,871 --> 00:19:28,869
and spray on the top and bottom of the leaves to help supplement nutrients through the leaves for the orchids.

78
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:39,867
This should be done early in the morning, so that by noon the leaves will dry before the sun shines.

79
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:51,898
After 30 minutes, remove the cotton and repeat once a week.

80
00:19:54,897 --> 00:20:03,896
and take out the orchid pot.

81
00:20:11,894 --> 00:20:14,893
2 Months Later.

82
00:20:17,893 --> 00:20:25,891
Many flower stems grow at the same time.

83
00:20:41,888 --> 00:20:47,887
Orchids also grow many new roots.

84
00:20:49,887 --> 00:20:58,885
With this simple method, you can easily care for blooming orchids at home.

85
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:19,142
If you find the video interesting, don't forget to like, share and subscribe to the channel to easily follow tips on growing orchids.

86
00:21:44,548 --> 00:21:49,541
Now I share with you a wonderful organic fertilizer,

87
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:52,679
And anyone can do it easily.

88
00:21:53,593 --> 00:21:55,593
Just 1 to 2 ripe bananas,

89
00:21:56,583 --> 00:22:03,572
And the orchid garden will bloom all kinds of flowers.

90
00:22:04,931 --> 00:22:13,903
Now I will revive this orchid with new flowers,

91
00:22:13,903 --> 00:22:19,902
You've seen this orchid lose all its flowers, leaving only withered branches

92
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:33,099
And here are the withered orchids that have been revived with lots of new flowers.

93
00:22:43,478 --> 00:22:47,463
STEP

94
00:22:52,866 --> 00:23:00,861
cut off the withers

95
00:23:14,129 --> 00:23:20,123
Apply toothpaste on the cut

96
00:23:32,908 --> 00:23:40,886
This will disinfect and help prevent rot

97
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:12,546
Don't throw away banana peels when eating bananas

98
00:24:27,943 --> 00:24:32,942
Use 1 to 2 ripe banana peels

99
00:24:52,014 --> 00:25:01,003
Clip the banana peel to the place where the flower buds can grow

100
00:25:01,003 --> 00:25:08,938
and note to remove after 6 hours

101
00:25:08,938 --> 00:25:18,967
This helps to create the right moisture, provide essential nutrients and stimulate flower sprouts,

102
00:25:22,002 --> 00:25:29,998
do this once a week

103
00:25:37,141 --> 00:25:39,141
STEP 2

104
00:25:39,141 --> 00:25:48,627
Use a banana peel to wipe the top and bottom of the leaves,

105
00:25:48,627 --> 00:25:55,626
Helps eliminate insects, fungi, bacteria hiding on orchid leaves,

106
00:25:55,626 --> 00:26:04,224
and at the same time provide a part of nutrients through the leaves for orchids

107
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:16,888
Orchids will be protected and will not be affected by yellowing and rotten leaves.

108
00:26:18,888 --> 00:26:26,886
After wiping, you will see green leaves,

109
00:26:29,582 --> 00:26:36,551
Orchids will photosynthesize better to increase resistance.

110
00:26:41,921 --> 00:26:43,921
 STEP 3

111
00:26:50,258 --> 00:26:55,248
1 liter of water

112
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:29,307
Leave in a cool and dark place for 1 day

113
00:27:38,711 --> 00:27:40,711
AFTER 1 DAY

114
00:27:46,056 --> 00:27:52,036
banana juice is darker

115
00:28:21,877 --> 00:28:26,863
Use this absorbent cotton

116
00:28:29,256 --> 00:28:35,228
 Clip a cotton ball where the flower buds can grow

117
00:28:35,228 --> 00:28:41,527
and note to remove after 6 hours

118
00:28:42,893 --> 00:28:50,891
This helps to create the right moisture, provide essential nutrients and stimulate flower sprouts,

119
00:28:50,891 --> 00:28:54,791
do this once a week

120
00:28:55,744 --> 00:28:58,723
STEP 4

121
00:29:00,574 --> 00:29:06,555
Normally after 3-4 weeks flower buds will be formed and develop like this,

122
00:29:06,555 --> 00:29:15,053
With a flower sprout this big, there's no need to sandwich banana peels with cotton balls

123
00:29:27,654 --> 00:29:37,649
You will be surprised how amazing this is

124
00:30:15,738 --> 00:30:25,706
Don't forget to subscribe to see my next videos

125
00:30:34,425 --> 00:30:36,425
STEP 5

126
00:30:37,272 --> 00:30:39,272
Add water to make 2 liters

127
00:30:40,236 --> 00:30:45,235
Water this banana for orchids once every 2-3 weeks

128
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:50,334
Banana peel is rich in potassium, phosphorus and essential vitamins.

129
00:30:50,334 --> 00:30:55,000
will promote the growth of orchid roots

130
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,765
In particular, the potassium in banana peels stimulates flowering very well.

131
00:31:01,765 --> 00:31:08,087
In addition, you need to combine using other organic fertilizers for orchids,

132
00:31:09,088 --> 00:31:17,062
like manure made from soybeans, peas, fish poop... as I shared,

133
00:31:17,062 --> 00:31:23,528
then make sure the orchid will grow healthy and produce many flowers

134
00:31:23,528 --> 00:31:29,527
Hope this sharing content will help you in taking better care of orchids at home

135
00:31:29,527 --> 00:31:34,526
I wish you luck and success

136
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:41,524
Thank you guys, see you in the next video!
