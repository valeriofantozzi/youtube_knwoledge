00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,359
I am very happy to welcome everyone to

00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,919
my channel where we explore natural

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,559
beauty and inspiring plant care methods

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,360
together. Today I want to share with you

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,759
an interesting way to grow orchids. No

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,560
need to water yet the flowers can still

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,720
bloom brightly all year round. This is a

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,960
simple and creative solution especially

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,400
helpful for those who love orchids but

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,480
don't have much time to care for them

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,880
everyday.

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,359
Let's get started. This is a small

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,079
orchid that I bought from a local flower

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:38,440
shop. Although the plant is small, it is

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,440
growing very healthily and vibrantly.

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,719
To apply the method of growing orchids

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,320
without watering, the first step is to

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,440
remove all the old growing medium,

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,840
especially the moss.

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,120
Moss retains moisture very well, which

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,079
will prevent the plant from growing

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,079
properly using this method.

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,079
The next step is to cut off any damaged

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,000
or dry roots. This is important because

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,920
unhealthy roots not only reduce the

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,840
plant's ability to absorb neut

27
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,840
nutrients, but can also cause diseases.

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,799
Removing them will help the orchid grow

29
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,640
stronger, creating a solid foundation

30
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,640
for growing using the no watering

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,640
method.

[Music]

34
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,520
To ensure the orchid doesn't rot during

35
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,720
the growing process, I use baking soda

36
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,720
to treat the cuts on the roots.

37
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,079
Baking soda helps kill bacteria and

38
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,520
fungi, preventing the formation of

39
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,600
pathogens while creating a clean

40
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,680
environment for the roots to grow.

41
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,680
Just half a teaspoon of baking soda is

42
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,680
enough.

43
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,720
Then mix it with.5 L of water.

44
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,959
Um, after preparing the baking soda

45
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,519
solution, soak the orchid in it for

46
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,519
about 10 minutes.

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,760
Soaking the plant helps disinfect

48
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,760
effectively, ensuring that the roots are

49
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,760
protected from bacteria and mold before

50
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,760
planting.

51
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,920
This is an important step that helps the

52
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,150
orchid stay healthy and grow well

53
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,330
throughout the care process.

[Music]

55
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,800
Next, I prepare rice to make a natural

56
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,319
fertilizer that helps stimulate the

57
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,879
rapid growth of the orchid after

58
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,120
planting.

59
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,400
Take one tablespoon of rice and soak it

60
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,640
in 0.5 L of water. This mixture will

61
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,280
provide essential nutrients to help the

62
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,280
orchid grow healthily.

63
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,159
Um, it's best to let the mixture soak

64
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,159
for about 10 to 30 minutes. This helps

65
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,879
the nutrients in the rice dissolve into

66
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:36,959
the water, creating a nutrient-rich

67
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:39,280
natural fertilizer for the plant.

68
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,200
While waiting, I will recycle plastic

69
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,799
bottle caps to make a no watering orchid

70
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,120
pot.

71
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,040
While waiting, I will recycle plastic

72
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,799

74
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,480
Uh, this is a great way to combine plant

135
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,640

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,360
Use a soft cloth or paper towel to

164
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,040
gently dry these areas, preventing the

165
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,040
orchid from rotting during the planting

168
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,920
When planting the orchid, we connect the

169
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,760
wick to the roots to ensure that water

170
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,160
is drawn up from the bottom of the pot

171
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,160
to the roots.

172
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,200
Then insert the growing medium such as

173
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,880
pine bark chips around the roots to

174
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,279
retain moisture and create space for the

175
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,279
roots to develop.

176
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,440
This growing medium helps the orchid

177
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:05,160
stay stable and grow strong in the no

178
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,160
water planting environment.

179
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,200
After

180
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,760
planting, we only need to water once to

181
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,399
allow the growing medium and wick to

182
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,399
absorb enough moisture.

183
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,480
Then you only need to change the water

184
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,480
when it becomes dirty. This helps keep

185
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,639
the orchid healthy without the need for

186
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,959
frequent watering while also preventing

187
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,959
root rot.

188
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,680
The wick will act as a bridge, allowing

189
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,560
water to be drawn up from the bottom of

190
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,399
the pot to the roots. This way, the

191
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,639
orchid will always receive the necessary

192
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:22,200
moisture naturally without the need for

193
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,200
direct watering.

194
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,600
After planting, we wait for about a week

195
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,760
to allow the orchid roots to stabilize

196
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,360
in the new environment.

197
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,120
Once the roots are settled, you can

198
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,440
start fertilizing the orchid to support

199
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,440
its growth.

[Music]

201
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,240
After a week, I start fertilizing the

202
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,240
orchid with rice water.

203
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:15,880
Take 1 tbsp of rice, then mix it with

204
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,880
one liter of water and stir well.

[Music]

206
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,519
After the rice has soaked, strain the

207
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,480
rice water to use as fertilizer for the

208
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,480
orchid.

209
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,240
Rice water contains many natural

210
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,079
nutrients that help stimulate the growth

211
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,079
of the orchid's roots, leaves, and

212
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,079
flowers.

213
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,399
After preparing the rice water, soak the

214
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,480
orchid pot in this solution for about 20

215
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,480
minutes.

216
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,800
Soaking the plant in rice water allows

217
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,959
the roots to absorb nutrients gradually.

218
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,160
Uh each month you only need to soak the

219
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:16,160
orchid pot in rice water twice.

220
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:20,760
Soaking the plant in rice water allows

221
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,760
the roots to absorb nutrients gradually.

222
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,880
This helps maintain healthy growth for

223
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,880
the orchid without the need for frequent

224
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,880
watering.

225
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,279
After soaking the orchid pot in rice

226
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,720
water for 20 minutes, remove the pot and

227
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,800
wait for the rice water to drain

228
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,199
completely before placing the pot into

229
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,199
the water container.

230
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,360
Uh then remove the pot and place it in a

231
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,120
spot with indirect sunlight. Note that

232
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,120
good fertilizer and the right planting

233
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,480
method will only be effective if the

234
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,160
orchid receives enough sunlight.

235
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,759
If there is a lack of sunlight, the

236
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,600
orchid will not grow well and the

237
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,600
fertilizer will not work at its full

238
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,600

239
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,730

[Music]

293
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,000
To care for it to continue flowering, I

294
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,920
first need to cut off the old flower

295
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:08,080

[Music]

299
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,600
Coffee contains some compounds with

300
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,560
antibacterial and antifungal properties,

301
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:27,039
helping to prevent infection at the cut.

[Music]

303
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,720
This is crucial because cuts on the

304
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:35,240

305
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,240
bacteria and fungi to enter,

324
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,159
Potatoes contain nutrients like

Um, wiping the leaves helps remove dust,

384
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,039
debris, and bacteria from the leaf

385
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,039

386
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:14,039
breathe better and absorb light more

387
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,039
effectively.

388
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,760
Wiping the leaves helps enhance

389
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,600
photosynthesis because clean leaves

390
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:33,240
absorb light better and can convert

391
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,240
energy more efficiently.

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,440
reduce the risk of mold.

um and bacterial diseases because a

397
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,279
clean leaf surface limits the

398
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,279
environment for harmful pathogens to

399
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,279
grow.

spray the entire orchid again with this

403

a favorable environment for mold and

409

orchid from staying wet for too long,

423
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,000
helping to avoid diseases related to

424
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
excessive moisture and enhancing its

426
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:02,000
After soaking for 20 minutes, take it

out and place the orchid pot in a place

428
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,640

As a growing medium, I use crushed pine

448
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:32,120
bark to help the roots stay airy but

449
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,120
still retain the necessary moisture.
