Hello everyone. Welcome to the Happiness

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,240
Garden channel.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,000
Today I'll share an amazing tip for

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,000
taking care of orchids after their

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,920
flowers have faded. This method is

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,920
especially effective for helping wilted

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,920
or weak orchids recover and grow

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,920
quickly.

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,760
Um, these are orchid pots that once

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,840
bloomed brilliantly but later withered,

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,599
became stunted, and were discarded by

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,000
people.

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,079
I am quietly observing, trying to see if

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,239
any plant still has life so I can save

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,920
it.

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,200
Even if it's just a bit of green at the

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,120
base or a small root reaching out, I

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,160
believe that with gentle care, they can

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,160
still recover and bloom again.

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,480
And as you can see among the discarded

21
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,920
orchid pots, one plant still remains.

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,680
The leaves at the base have turned

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,120
yellow and wilted, but there are still

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,039
two green leaves at the top.

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,960
Uh, I picked it up with the hope that it

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:08,080
will come back to life and help it grow

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,600
strong again. Let's see how I do it.

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,250
First, you need to gently cut off all

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:17,280
the damaged yellow or wilted leaves.

00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:18,640
[Music]

31
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,200
You can see that the leaves of this

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,950
orchid have been infected with white

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,479
fungus.

34
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:28,799
[Music]

35
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,200
It is these white mold spots that have

36
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,780
silently attacked, causing the orchid to

37
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,920
weaken rapidly. As you can see,

38
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:42,110
[Music]

39
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:46,399
this wilted leaf needs to be removed.

[Music]

41
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,640
Removing the weakened parts helps the

42
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,040
plant avoid wasting energy on sections

43
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,040
that cannot recover, allowing it to

44
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,200
focus its energy on nourishing the

45
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,900
healthier parts and increasing its

46
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,399
chance of recovery.

have you along on this journey.

59
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,160
Next, you need to cut off the old and

60
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,160
damaged flower spike.

61
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,680
Uh, you can see that the white mold has

62
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,680
spread and attacked even the flower

63
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,680
spike.

64
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,680
When the fungus has reached this stage,

65
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,080
the plant will weaken quickly if not

66
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,870
treated in time. This is when we need to

67
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:12,800
step in to stop it from spreading.

68
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:14,959
[Music]

69
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,519
Next, we will check the growing medium

70
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,360
and the plant's roots. This is a very

71
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,400
important step to determine whether the

72
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,400
plant is still healthy and if we need to

73
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,720
replace the medium to help it recover

74
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,200
better.

75
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,440
Uh you can see that there are still many

76
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,840
gray and organic fertilizer pellets in

77
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,200
the growing medium. This type of

78
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,360
fertilizer may not be suitable for

79
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,440
orchid growth as orchids prefer a well

80
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,780
ventilated environment with gentle more

81
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:55,489
natural nutrients.

[Music]

83
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,040
We need to remove the entire old growing

84
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,799
medium. Replacing it will help create a

85
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,599
clean and well ventilated environment

86
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,599
for the roots to recover.

[Music]

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,919
After that, we will cut off all the

89
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,919
damaged roots.

90
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,800
[Music]

91
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,639
Rotten, brittle, or mushy roots can no

92
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,639
longer absorb water and nutrients, and

93
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,639
keeping them may harm the plant.

94
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,479
Removing them helps keep the plant

95
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,390
healthy and ready to grow stronger new

96
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:50,970
roots.

[Music]

98
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,520
After cutting off the damaged roots, we

99
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,840
can see that there are still quite a few

100
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,199
healthy roots remaining.

101
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,400
This will make the plant's recovery

102
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,320
process easier and more effective. When

103
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,800
the roots are still healthy, the plant

104
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,800
can absorb water and nutrients better,

105
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,650
helping it regain its vitality more

106
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:24,400
quickly.

[Music]

108
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,039
You can see that the old leaf stem is

109
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,199
also infected with fungus. Therefore, we

110
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,280
need to remove this part to prevent the

111
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,639
fungus from spreading to other parts of

112
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,800
the plant while also keeping the plant

113
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,759
disease-free and providing a better

114
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,759
environment for recovery.

118
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,600
After that, we rinse the entire plant

119
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,600
thoroughly under running water.

120
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,880
Uh, this cleaning process helps remove

121
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,800
all the old soil, mold, and remaining

122
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,520
bacteria, creating the best conditions

123
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,520
for the plant to recover.

125
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:53,039

[Music]

127
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,479
The first ingredient I use to make a

128
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,720
recovery fertilizer for orchids is aloe

129
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,720
vera leaf.

130
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,759
I cut the aloe vera leaf into small

131
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,440
slices and put them into a jar.

132
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,120
Cutting it into smaller pieces helps the

133
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,039
aloe release its nutrients more

134
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,080
effectively and dissolve more easily

135
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,080
when mixed with other ingredients.

136
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,160
The next ingredient I use is tobacco.

137
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,400
With its natural antibacterial

138
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,039
properties, tobacco helps eliminate

139
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,039
harmful fungi and bacteria, supporting

140
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,790
root protection during the orchids

141
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:36,180
recovery process.

142
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:36,180
[Music]

143
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,400
In addition, tobacco also helps repel

144
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,400
insects, protecting the orchid from

145
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,240
pests during the recovery phase. It's a

146
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,880
simple yet highly effective ingredient

147
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,880
in plant care.

148
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,400
I add all the ingredients into about one

149
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,759
liter of boiling water.

150
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,759
The high temperature will help the

151
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,840
nutrients in the aloe vera and tobacco

152
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:06,120
release more quickly, forming a natural

153
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,120
solution that supports orchid recovery.

154
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:12,360
After that, we wait until the water has

155
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,360
completely cooled down.

156
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,080
After the water cools down, we proceed

157
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,919
to strain out the residue. Filtering

158
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,599
carefully will make the solution

159
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,680
clearer, preventing sediment from

160
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,720
sticking to the roots or affecting the

161
00:08:27,680 --> 00:09:10,000
air flow of the growing medium.

[Music]

163
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,920
The Next ingredient I use is vitamin B1.

164
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,760
This vitamin helps stimulate root growth

165
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,720
and allows the plant to recover more

166
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,720
quickly after being damaged.

167
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,839
The main component of vitamin B1 is

168
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,959
thamin monitrate with a concentration of

169
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,720
2.5 mg. This is the key active

170
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,720
ingredient that stimulates the formation

171
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,360
of new roots and supports the plant's

172
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,360
recovery after pruning.

173
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,690
I add three tablets of vitamin B1 and

174
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,109
stir well until fully dissolved.

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:13,040
After that, I soak the plant's roots in

178
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,040
this mixture for about 20 minutes.

179
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,000
The soaking time is just enough for the

180
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,600
roots to absorb nutrients while also

181
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,560
disinfecting and stimulating the

182
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,560
regeneration of new roots.

183
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,959
While waiting for the soaking time, you

184
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,440
can use a soft cloth to absorb the

185
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:45,160
mixture and gently wipe both the top and

186
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,160
underside of the leaves.

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,959
After soaking for about 20 minutes,

193
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,760
gently remove the orchid from the

194
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:22,720
solution. At this point, the roots have

195
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:27,399
been cleaned and have absorbed enough

196
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,399
nutrients to begin the recovery process.

197
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,360
[Music]

198
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,880
Since the orchid stem is quite long, I

199
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,959
cut the plant into two parts to

200
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,959
separately recover the top and the base.

201
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,880
This helps each part focus its energy

202
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:46,920
more effectively and increases the

203
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,920
chance of developing new roots.

204
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,160
I use a clean cloth to gently clean the

205
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,160
cut. Cleaning helps prevent bacteria and

206
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,440
fungi from entering, allowing the cut to

207
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,440
dry quickly and heal better.

[Music]

209
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,840
After that, I apply a thin layer of

210
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:24,240
melted wax solution to the cut.

211
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,320
[Music]

212
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,079
This layer of wax helps protect the

213
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,480
wound, preventing water and bacteria

214
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,700
from entering and also supports faster

215
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:54,960
healing of the cut.

[Music]

217
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,639
To replant the orchid, I use moss as the

218
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,639
growing medium.

219
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,959
Uh, but before planting, pour the

220
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,959
prepared solution in to soak the moss.

221
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:25,000
Uh but before planting, pour the

222
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,000
prepared solution in to soak the moss.

223
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,310
Soak the moss in the solution for about

224
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,800
10 minutes.

[Music]

226
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,279
While waiting for the moss to soak, I

227
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,279
repurpose a used plastic cup to recycle

228
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,680
it into a seedling pot for the orchid

229
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:48,170
top. This is a simple, cost-effective

230
00:13:43,680 --> 00:14:03,040
and environmentally friendly method.

[Music]

232
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,519
After that, I take the moss out of the

233
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,320
solution. At this point, the moss is

234
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:15,160
clean and full of nutrients, ready to be

235
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,160
used as a growing medium for the orchid.

236
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:29,480
Then I plant the top part of the orchid

237
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,480
into the prepared pot with moss.

238
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,120
The stem will be gently nestled into the

239
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,720
moist moss, creating favorable

240
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,040
conditions for growth and the formation

241
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,040
of new roots.

244
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,720
For the lower stem with roots, I planted

245
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,360
into a larger pot that has drainage

246
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,839
holes at the bottom. This design helps

247
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,240
the roots get enough air, prevents water

248
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:18,440
logging, and reduces the risk of root

249
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,440
rot during the recovery process.

250
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,480
The roots will be gently nestled into

251
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,399
the moist moss, creating favorable

You can see that the lower stem with

265
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,959
roots has revived into a healthy baby

266
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,000
orchid or kei. A wonderful testament to

267
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,000
patience and proper care.

268
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,639
The baby orchid is growing very well

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,839
with thick, plump, and healthy roots.

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,320
This is a sign that the plant is

271
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:42,279
absorbing nutrients effectively and is

272
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,279

the leaves look fresher and greener than

276
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,120
before. This is a positive sign that the

277
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:03,279
plant is gradually recovering.

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:11,000
ensure they are healthy before

281
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,000

orchid pot in a cool, well ventilated

305
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,840
area for about 1 to 2 days to let the

306
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,160

307
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,640

308
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,640
young roots.

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,400
When you see that the roots have started

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,640
to cling firmly to the growing medium,

311
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,320
