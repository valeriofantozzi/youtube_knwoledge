Welcome to the happiness garden where we

00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,279
explore simple yet effective orchid care

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:11,120

00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,719
filled with blooming flowers and joy.

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,040
In today's video, I will share with you

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,600
a very simple way to propagate orchids

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,840
at home using the very flower spikes

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,680

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,439

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,360
banana, a familiar fruit that contains

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,720

When eating bananas, don't throw away

40
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,200
the peels as they contain plenty of

41
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,560
potassium and natural minerals that help

42
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:28,920
orchids grow strong, root quickly,

00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,120
Uh, set aside a small portion of the

45
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,360
banana peel for later use and cut the

46
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,640
remaining peel into small pieces to put

47
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,519
into the bottle along with the

48
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,599
eggshells. This natural combination will

49
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,480
create a wonderful nutrient mix for your

50
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,480

water into the bottle. The hot water

54
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,080
will help release the nutrients from the

55
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,400

If you persist in doing this once a

86
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,520

When the last flowers have just fallen,

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,720
that is the golden time to propagate

93
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,880
from the flower spikes. Because at this

94
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,199
time, the plant still holds a lot of

95
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,440
stored energy, helping the flower spikes

96
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:19,240
easily grow new roots and develop into

100
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,160

101
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,320

102
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,520

top of the moss, being careful not to

381
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,840
bury the roots too deeply. Let the young

382
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,679
roots stay exposed to the air and

383
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,600
gradually grow down into the medium

384
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:53,960
naturally. This helps the plant

385
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,960
stabilize and develop more healthily.

386
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,000
And you should mist the plant to

387
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,039
maintain moisture whenever the growing

388
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,840
medium starts to dry. This gently keeps

389
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:06,000
the young roots hydrated. Only after the

390
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,080
roots have firmly attached to the medium

391
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,919
should you begin fertilizing to avoid

392
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:14,200
damaging the tender roots and support

393
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,200
the baby orchid's steady development.
