Hello everyone. Today I will share how

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,720
to take care of newly purchased orchids

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:10,200
using only rice, a simple but extremely

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,200
effective ingredient.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,160
If you just bought orchids and are

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,240
worried about weak roots, yellow leaves,

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,400
or orchids not blooming, make sure to

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,320
watch this entire video. I will also

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,400
share little tips to help your orchids

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,680
grow strong from roots to leaves and

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,680
bloom beautifully in the future.

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,120
Um, as soon as you bring a new orchid

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,120
home, the first thing you need to do is

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,480
gently open the packaging so the plant

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,550
can breathe.

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,360
Next, place the orchid pot in a well

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,520
ventilated area for one day, allowing

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,680
the plant to adapt and feel safe in its

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,680
new environment.

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,399
This helps the orchid quickly adapt to

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,480
the new environment and minimizes stress

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,320
as the plant has already endured a lot

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,650
of pressure during packaging and

25
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:10,260
transportation.

27
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,320
After one day, gently take the orchid

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,080
pot out and remove the yellow or wilted

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,860
leaves so the plant can focus its energy

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:30,730
on nurturing the healthy parts.

33
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,040
Next, carefully check the orchid's

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,079
growing medium and root system to ensure

35
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,079
the plant is developing healthily.

During the inspection, I noticed that

39
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,399
this growing medium is quite old and

40
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,290
needs to be replaced for the orchid to

41
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:12,640
grow better.

[Music]

43
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,879
However, since the orchid has many buds

44
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,640
and flowers on its stems, if you want to

45
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,319
keep the flowers from wilting, you

46
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,360
should retain part of the old growing

47
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,680
medium. This helps the plant avoid shock

48
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,680
and keeps the petals looking fresh and

49
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,680
beautiful.

to care for orchids? Comment below.

62

The ingredients and tools needed to care

63
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,560
for orchids. First, a cup to mix the

64
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,560
solution.

65
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,159
Next, we need to prepare rice, a simple

66
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,239
but extremely useful ingredient for

67
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,879
orchids.

68
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,879
Next, prepare methylionium chloride,

69
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,760
which helps disinfect and protect the

70
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,440
orchid from harmful bacteria.

71
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,040
A clean jar to ferment the rice,

72
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,720
allowing the fermentation process to

73
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,720
occur gently and safely for the orchid.

74
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,480
Next, prepare a bowl to mix the solution

75
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,200
and a small spoon to water the plant

76
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,200
easily and accurately.

77
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,120
Also prepare a sieve to filter out

78
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,799
residues, ensuring the orchid watering

79
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,879
solution is clean and safe for the

80
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,040
plant.

81
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,640
Next is clean water, an essential

82
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,640
ingredient for preparing the orchid care

83
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,640
solution.

84
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,920
Prepare an orchid pot with drainage

85
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,920
holes at the bottom to keep the roots

86
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,480
well ventilated and prevent water

87
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,000
logging.

88
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,319
Prepare the growing medium, which is

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,560
sterilized pine bark chips to help the

90
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,560
orchid roots anchor firmly and grow

91
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,400
healthily.

92
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,759
And finally, prepare a bit of moss to

93
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,759
retain moisture for the roots and keep

94
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,759
the orchid fresh, the orchidish, and

95
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,759
healthy.

96
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,520
Step one, disinfect the orchid. Protect

97
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,280
the roots and leaves from the very

98
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,680
beginning.

99
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,680
Next, take two cups of water, about 500

100
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,680
ml, to prepare the disinfectant

101
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,680
solution.

104
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,430
chloride to create a safe disinfectant

105
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,880

111
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,479
Then pour this solution in and soak the

112
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,800
roots along with the growing medium for

113
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,199
about 20 minutes. This helps remove

114
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,600
bacteria and fungi clinging to the roots

115
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,400

117
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,800
Next, use a soft cloth soaked in the

118
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,600
solution and gently wipe both the top

119
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,160
and bottom surfaces of the leaves. This

120
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,840
helps remove dust, fungi, and insects

121
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,890
from the leaves, keeping them clean and

122
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:11,680
improving photosynthesis.

You can see that this orchid has black

125
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,479
mold, probably because it was grown in

126
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,000
an industrial orchid garden with

127
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,479
insufficient sunlight, making it prone

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,479
to fungal infection.

pot in a location with sufficient light

135
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,400

195
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,279
Use the soaked rice water to pour

196
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,160
directly onto the medium around the

197
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,839
roots. Um, providing natural nutrients

198
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,920
and promoting healthy root growth for

199
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,920
the orchid.

200
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,200
Water about two to three times per

201
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,959
month, allowing the orchid to absorb

202
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,800
nutrients from the rice while still

203
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,800
growing naturally and healthily.

204
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,640
Fermented rice water is rich in

205
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,640
vitamins, minerals, and natural sugars,

206
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,320
helping orchid roots and leaves absorb

207
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,959
nutrients effectively and promoting

208
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,959
healthy plant growth.

209
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,640
The fermentation process produces

210
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,920
beneficial microorganisms, helping

211
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,079
improve the quality of the growing

212
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,399
medium, balance the living environment

213
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:56,040
for orchid roots, and limit harmful

214
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,040
bacteria and fungi.

215
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,680
You can also pour this mixture into a

216
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,160
spray bottle to mist directly onto the

217
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,079
leaves, helping nutrients cover evenly

218
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,079
and allowing the orchid to absorb them

219
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,079
faster.

220
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,639
When spraying, remember to mist both the

221
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,959
top and underside of the leaves so

222
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,360
nutrients penetrate deeply while also

223
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:28,760
removing dust and harmful microorganisms

224
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,760
on the leaves.

225
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,079
Regularly spray or water with fermented

226
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,920
rice water about two to three times per

227
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,920
month. This not only provides nutrients

228
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,480
but also helps the the orchid grow

229
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,870
naturally with lush green leaves and

230
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,590
healthy roots.

[Music]

232
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,160
However, you should not spray onto the

233
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,399
flower petals because when the petals

234
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,800
get wet, they wilt quickly and are

235
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,800
easily damaged.

236
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,200
Therefore, when watering or spraying the

237
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,279
solution, focus only on the roots and

238
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,959
leaves, avoiding wetting the flowers to

239
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,959
keep them fresh and beautiful for

240
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,959
longer.

241
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,040
After watering, you can leave the orchid

242
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:24,240
pot soaking in the liquid fertilizer

243
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,560
solution for about 10 to 20 minutes,

244
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,560
allowing the roots to absorb the maximum

245
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,560
nutrients.

246
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,519
Step five, additional care, light, and

247
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,519
environment.

248
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,120
After soaking for about 20 minutes, take

249
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,680
the orchid pot out and place it in a

250
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,920
location with gentle sunlight, avoiding

251
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,399
harsh sun so the plant can gradually

252
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,399
adapt and keep the flowers and leaves

253
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,399
healthy.

254
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,399
In addition, you should regularly

255
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,399
observe the growing medium. If it

256
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,399
appears dry, you can supplement with

257
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,560
clean water intermittently to maintain

258
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,560
ideal moisture for the orchid roots to

259
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,560
grow.

260
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,120
And don't forget to regularly check the

261
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,959
roots, leaves, and flowers as these are

262
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,120
key indicators reflecting the health of

263
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,120
the orchid.

264
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,760
And here are the results after 3 weeks.

265
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,839
After just 3 weeks of care, the orchid

266
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,680
leaves have become firm, glossy green,

267
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:35,040
and almost all the black mold on the

268
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,040
leaves has disappeared.

269
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:45,330
[Music]

270
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,680
In addition, you can also see many new

271
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,680
roots growing healthy and developing

272
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,680
well.

273
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,120
All these changes show that the orchid

274
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,120
is recovering and growing vigorously

275
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,760
thanks to healthy roots, green leaves,

276
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:09,440
and wellprotected flowers.

278
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,920
The petals are still fresh and have not

279
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,760
fallen, indicating that the orchid is

280
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,000
being cared for properly and maintaining

281
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,000
good health.

282
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,160
The combination of lush green leaves,

283
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,160
healthy new roots, and long-lasting

284
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,800
flowers shows that this entire care

285
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,800
method is truly effective, helping the

286
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,959
orchid grow comprehensively from roots

287
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,959
to blooms.
