Welcome to my channel!

2
00:00:03,734 --> 00:00:11,732
If you have a wilted orchid like this

3
00:00:12,699 --> 00:00:17,698
Don't rush to throw it away

4
00:00:19,056 --> 00:00:27,030
Now I share how to recover quickly with natural fertilizers

5
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:36,893
Please remove inorganic fertilizers and damaged roots

6
00:00:57,698 --> 00:01:03,888
Because the roots do not rot, I keep the old planting material to help the orchid recover quickly

7
00:01:07,887 --> 00:01:15,885
and remove all yellow and rotten leaves

8
00:01:32,082 --> 00:01:39,881

11
00:02:45,868 --> 00:02:52,900
Now you need to soak the entire orchid in water at room temperature for 1 hour.

12
00:02:57,081 --> 00:03:03,897
This helps to quickly restore wilted roots and leaves

13
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:16,897
Awaken the ability of fresh roots and leaves to absorb water

14
00:03:19,643 --> 00:03:26,893
Place in a cool place for 1 hour

15
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:38,890
Now you take 1/3 teaspoon of sugar

16
00:04:01,614 --> 00:04:08,884
Mix with 500ml of water at room temperature

17
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:28,880
Then take 500ml of warm water

18
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:43,878
Add 1 teaspoon of dry yeast (yeast used to make bread)

19
00:05:06,884 --> 00:05:13,872
Wait 1 hour for the yeast to develop before using it as fertilizer

20
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:28,869
After soaking for 1 hour, take the orchid out

21
00:05:50,324 --> 00:05:56,896
Then soak the leaves in sugar water for 30 minutes

22
00:06:32,474 --> 00:06:39,888
After soaking for 30 minutes, take the orchid out

23
00:06:45,887 --> 00:06:52,885
Nutrients in sugar penetrate the leaves, helping wilted leaves recover quickly

24
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:08,882
Now mix the sugar water with the dry yeast solution

25
00:07:09,882 --> 00:07:19,880
This will create a natural fertilizer that will stimulate strong rooting and plant recovery.

26
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:46,875
Soak the orchid root in this water for 30 minutes

27
00:07:49,874 --> 00:07:56,873
will help stimulate rooting extremely quickly

28
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:16,869
The remaining liquid fertilizer is used to water orchid pots

29
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:32,899
Water each orchid pot with 10 tablespoons

30
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:46,896
This fertilizer helps stimulate root growth

31
00:08:47,885 --> 00:08:52,895
A strong root system will help the orchid absorb nutrients best

32
00:08:55,894 --> 00:09:02,893
Doing this 1-2 times/month will be very good for the orchid

33
00:09:37,435 --> 00:09:45,884
Water the orchid roots with this microbial fertilizer solution.

34
00:09:45,884 --> 00:09:52,950
Beneficial microorganisms will grow in the orchid pot.

35
00:09:55,704 --> 00:10:02,881
Helps protect orchid roots from rot caused by fungi and bacteria.

36
00:10:03,881 --> 00:10:10,879
This type of fertilizer also helps balance the PH level in orchid pots.

37
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:17,878
Helps stimulate orchid roots to grow and not be damaged by acid.

38
00:10:21,568 --> 00:10:28,876
After soaking for 30 minutes, take the orchid out

39
00:10:38,765 --> 00:10:46,872
The roots have become juicier and greener

40
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:56,870
I use pine bark to grow orchids

41
00:11:54,636 --> 00:12:00,891
Cover the surface of the orchid pot with a little moss

42
00:12:00,891 --> 00:12:06,890
Helps retain moisture better

43
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:16,888
Then apply this microbial fertilizer to the orchids every 2 weeks

44
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:28,885
will create beneficial organisms in the growing environment and stimulate orchid roots

45
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:38,883
On weekdays, you just need to spray mist to keep it moist and water when the substrate is dry

46
00:12:50,754 --> 00:12:58,879
Then place the orchid pot in a cool place with enough light for the orchid to recover

47
00:13:00,968 --> 00:13:05,878
Results after 1 month

48
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:15,876
After only 1 month orchid roots have grown a lot and are healthy

49
00:13:21,084 --> 00:13:28,873
These new roots will help the orchid absorb nutrients and water best

50
00:13:34,872 --> 00:13:42,871
and gradually the leaves will become fresh again

51
00:14:20,882 --> 00:14:26,895
Take 1/5 teaspoon of sugar

52
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:45,891
and Take 1/5 teaspoon of dry yeast

53
00:14:49,891 --> 00:14:55,889
Mix with 300ml warm water

54
00:15:01,548 --> 00:15:07,887
and wait until the water cools to room temperature

55
00:15:13,807 --> 00:15:20,884
Then use this microbial fertilizer to water every 2 weeks

56
00:15:24,267 --> 00:15:31,381
This type of fertilizer is especially good for weak, stunted orchids with underdeveloped roots.

57
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:40,214
because it does not shock weak orchids like chemical fertilizers.

58
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:48,879
Placing it in a place with light sunlight will be best for orchids.

59
00:15:52,056 --> 00:15:56,877
after the next 1 month

60
00:16:00,863 --> 00:16:06,875
The orchid has completely recovered

61
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:36,869
The leaves are normal green and thick

62
00:16:52,121 --> 00:16:59,898
The roots are very fat and have many new roots

63
00:17:13,224 --> 00:17:19,894
