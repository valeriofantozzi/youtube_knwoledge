Welcome to my garden, where every orchid

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,440
tells its own story. In today's video,

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,840
I'll continue to share with you a simple

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,440
yet incredibly effective secret. How to

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,559
make a natural fertilizer that helps

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:18,080
orchids grow strong, root quickly, and

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,840
especially bloom three times more. With

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,080
just a little patience and love for your

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,510
plants, you'll see your garden filled

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:32,079
with gentle colors and sweet fragrances.

12
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,880
Let's get started.

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,360
This is an orchid. After all, its petals

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,000
have withered, leaving only the bare

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,559
stem after its blooming season. When the

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,559
flowers fade, the plant often weakens

17
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,640
because it has used up all its energy to

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,800
nourish those beautiful blooms.

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,360
Therefore, if not cared for properly,

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,680
the orchid can easily become exhausted,

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,920
grow slowly, or even suffer from root

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,920
dryness and leaf yellowing. But don't

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,600
worry, with just a bit of care and

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,920
natural nourishment, you can help your

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,520
orchid recover quickly and prepare for a

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,600
new vibrant blooming season.

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,479
First, you need to gently cut off the

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,000
entire old flower spike. This helps the

29
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,080
plant stop wasting energy on the

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,840
withered part and instead focus on

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,840
nourishing new roots and leaves.

32
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,080
After that, carefully check the roots of

33
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,080
the plant.

34
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,240
You can gently squeeze each root with

35
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,759
your fingers. If the roots are green and

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,640
feel firm, it's a sign that they're

37
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,320
still healthy.

38
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,640
On the other hand, if the roots have

39
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,200
turned dark, feel soft, or are hollow

40
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,360
inside, it means they've rotted and need

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,320
to be cut off immediately to prevent the

42
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,079
rot from spreading to other roots.

43
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,640
Cleaning the roots will help the plant

44
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,710
absorb nutrients better and quickly

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,770

Next, remove any damaged or yellowing

58
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,000
leaves. These leaves can no longer

59
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,879
photosynthesize and may become a hiding

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,879
place for fungi and insects. By removing

61
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,360
them, the plant no longer has to share

62
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,680
its energy with weak leaves, allowing it

63
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:04,120
to focus on nourishing the healthy ones

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,080
good condition, meaning it's dry, clean,

Next, sprinkle a little cinnamon powder

72
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,920
over the cut areas. Cinnamon has natural

73
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,319
antibacterial and antifungal properties

74
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,760
that help the wounds dry quickly and

[Music]

84
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,959
After sprinkling the cinnamon powder,

85
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,680
let the plant rest for about a day and

86
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,079
avoid watering it. This resting period

87
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,840
allows the cut areas to dry completely,

88
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,840
preventing water or bacteria from

89
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,160
entering and causing root rot.

90
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,880
Next, we'll prepare a natural fertilizer

91
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,199
to help the orchid recover quickly. The

92
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,880
first ingredient is onion, a familiar

93
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,520
bulb that contains many nutrients

94
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,720
beneficial for the plant.

95
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,720
Take about 20 g of onion, then cut it

96
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,120
into small slices so the nutrients can

97
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,680
easily dissolve in water. Onion helps

98
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,600
stimulate root growth, fight bacteria,

99
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,479
and restore the plant's vitality after

100
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,479
flowering.

101
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,280
After chopping the onion, put all of it

102
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,840
into a clean container. Then, pour in

103
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,680
about one liter of freshly boiled water.

104
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,600
The hot water will help extract the

105
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,600
valuable nutrients from the onion,

106
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,280
creating a solution rich in natural

107
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,960
vitamins and minerals.

After that, cover the container tightly

110
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,080
and let the solution sit for about 1

111
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,520
day. This resting time allows the

112
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,440
nutrients from the onion to fully

113
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,360
dissolve into the water, creating a

114
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,140
concentrated and nutrient-rich natural

115
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:31,440

117
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,680
The next ingredient is rice, a familiar

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,320
component that provides excellent

119
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,880
nutrition for orchids. You only need 3

120
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,639
teaspoons of rice. Not too much as this

121
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,639
small amount already contains enough

122
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,280
starch and minerals to nourish the

123
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,120
roots. Rice helps the plant absorb

124
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,320
natural energy, recover quickly, and

125
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,320
make the leaves greener and shinier.

126
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,960
Then pour one liter of room temperature

127
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,160
water into the container with the rice

128
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,160
and close the lid tightly.

129
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,560
Let the mixture sit for about 1 day to

130
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,560
allow the rice to ferment slightly. This

131
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,280
process activates natural enzymes and

132
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:15,319
beneficial microorganisms enhancing the

133
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,319
nutritional value of the solution.

Next, strain out the residue to obtain

140
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,960
the clear liquid. This is the part that

141
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:48,600
contains the most nutrients and is safe

142
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,600
for the orchid roots.

143
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,160
After that, stir the rice water well so

144
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,759

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,800
foundation for the orchid to bloom in

191
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,800
the next season.

192
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,360
Water gently and evenly so the

193
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,720
fertilizer penetrates deeply without

194
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,720
disturbing the roots or growing medium.

195
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,839
Next, take a soft cloth and soak it

196
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,839
evenly with the natural fertilizer

197
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,839
mixture.

198
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,360
Then, place the cloth in the leaf axles

199
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,040
right at the spots where you want to

200
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,360
stimulate the plant to produce new

201
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,360
flower spikes.

[Music]

203
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,080
The nutrients will be absorbed directly

204
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,480
at this point, promoting the formation

205
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,399
and growth of flower buds, helping them

206
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,519
become bigger, healthier, and more

207
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,519
vibrant when they bloom.

208
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,440
This is a simple yet very effective tip

209
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:15,399
to lay the foundation for a thriving

210
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,399
next flowering season.

211
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,480
Uh, leave the cloth soaked in fertilizer

212
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,480
in the leaf axle for about 20 minutes so

213
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,360
the nutrients can penetrate deeply into

214
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,360
the area that needs stimulation.

[Music]

216
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,040
Step four, pour the natural fertilizer

217
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,959
mixture into a clean spray bottle. Using

218
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,440
a spray bottle helps evenly distribute

219
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,440
the fertilizer onto the leaves, roots,

220
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,440
and leaf axles without harming the

221
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,440
plant.

222
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,760
When sprayed gently, the nutrients are

223
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,240
evenly absorbed, helping the leaves stay

224
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,240
lush, the roots grow strong, and

225
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,560
naturally stimulating the development of

226
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,560
flower buds.

227
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,320
This is the final step to complete the

228
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,560
care process, resulting in a vibrant

229
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,560
orchid ready for the new flowering

230
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,560
season.

231
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,680
Use a spray bottle to evenly mist the

232
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,399
fertilizer mixture over the growing

233
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,880
medium and roots. This allows the roots

234
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,440
to absorb nutrients directly while

235
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,120
keeping the medium adequately moist,

236
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,519
creating a favorable environment for

237
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,519
strong root growth.

238
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,160
When the roots are well nourished, the

239
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,480
orchid will recover quickly. Its leaves

240
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,160
will stay lush and green, and it will be

241
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,399
ready for new flower buds.

242
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,160
After spraying, let the orchid sit in

243
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,959
the fertilizer mixture for about 20

244
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,120
minutes. This period allows the

245
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,519
nutrients to penetrate deeply into the

246
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,040
roots and growing medium, effectively

247
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,560
nourishing the plant from the base to

248
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:15,800
the leaves.

250
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,000
After soaking for 20 minutes, take the

251
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,000
orchid pot out.

252
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,959
At the same time, gently remove the

253
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:32,079
cloth from the leaf axles and let the

254
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:34,320
plant continue to rest. Do this once a

255
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,560
week consistently for a few weeks and

256
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,440
you'll see strong new flower spikes

257
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,040
ready for vibrant blooms. This is a

258
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,519
delicate care method that helps the

259
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:47,440
orchid grow evenly and bloom beautifully

260
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:49,760
without using chemicals.

261
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,760
Step five. After letting the plant rest

262
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,120
in the fertilizer mixture, if there is

263
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,030
any water remaining on the leaves,

264
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:59,360
gently blot it dry with a soft cloth.

from growing on the leaf surface while

268
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,279
keeping the leaves dry and healthy.

269
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,120
Clean leaves absorb light better,

270
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,880
promote effective photosynthesis, and

271
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,200
support the overall growth of the

272
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,720
orchid. This is a small but very

273
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,200
important step to protect the plant's

274
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,200
long-term vitality.

275
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,040
Any remaining fertilizer mixture can be

276
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:35,160
poured into a spray bottle and used on

277
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,160
other orchids in your garden.

penetrate deeply into the roots and

282
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,920
leaves. This helps the orchid absorb

283
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,399
nutrients quickly, resulting in lush

284
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:00,600
green leaves and stronger roots, ready

285
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,600
for overall healthy growth.

286
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,720
Onion has natural antibacterial

287

properties, while fermented rice water

288
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,079
provides enzymes and beneficial
