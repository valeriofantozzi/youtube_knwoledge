00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,480
Welcome everyone to my channel. Today I

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,640
want to explore with you a simple but

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,639
truly effective way to help an orchid

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,559
suffering from rot recover quickly.

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,400
Even though the plant may look weak on

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,240
the outside, as long as we take care of

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,130
it properly, it can still come back

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:24,410
strong and continue to grow beautifully.

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,960
Um, you can see that all the leaves of

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,440
the plant have become soft and rotten,

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,200
turning dark brown. At first glance,

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,760
anyone might think that this plant can

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,680
no longer be saved. But don't give up,

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,680
because with a little patience and the

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,680
right care, miracles can still happen.

tips. It's wonderful to have you along

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,280
for the journey.

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,560
Um, the tip of the flower stem is still

29
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,240
fresh and healthy, so I decided to keep

30
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,560
this part to try propagating it by

31
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,799
cutting.

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,320
Next, I gently cut off all the roots

33
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,320
that were damaged, rotten, or dried out.

34
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,159
This step is very important because if

35
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,840
we keep the unhealthy roots, they can

36
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,079
spread disease to the healthy parts of

37
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,079
the plant.

38
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,600
Although the orchid has decayed quite a

39
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,240
lot, fortunately, there are still a few

40
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,680
fresh and healthy roots left.

41
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,360
These roots will be the hope for the

42
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,640
plant to continue absorbing nutrients

43
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,640
and begin its journey of revival.

44
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,479
Now I will rinse the entire plant with

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,479
water to remove all the rotten parts and

46
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,479
any residues that could cause fungal

47
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,479
disease.

48
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,680
To start the recovery process, I first

49
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,720
use a fresh aloe vera leaf.

50
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,400
Next, I add two sprouted garlic cloves.

51
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,040
Sprouted garlic contains a very high

52
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,480
amount of natural oxin, a growth hormone

53
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,120
that helps stimulate the development of

54
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,200
roots and new shoots. Thanks to that,

55
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,250
the orchid will recover quickly, become

56
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:40,959
stronger, and soon burst with new life.

57
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:42,800
[Music]

58
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,120
If you don't have sprouted garlic, you

59
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,160
can completely replace it with regular

60
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,800
garlic. Although the amount of oxin in

61
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,640
regular garlic is slightly lower, it

62
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,400
still has excellent antibacterial

63
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,770
properties and effectively supports the

64
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,599
plant's recovery.

65
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,599
[Music]

66
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,000
Then I add one liter of water to the

67
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,000
aloe vera and garlic.

68
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,159
Next, I put everything into a blender

69
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,239
and blend it until smooth. This way, the

70
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,440
nutrients from the aloe vera and garlic

71
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,280
will completely mix into the water.

72
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,000
After blending, I strain out the residue

73
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,800
to obtain a clear and smooth solution.

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,640
This helps the helps the nutrients

75
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,400
absorb more quickly into the roots and

76
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,959
prevents residue from accumulating in

77
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,040
the plant's growing medium.

78
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,799
After that, I gently place the orchid

79
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,000
into the mixture and soak it for about

80
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,000
20 minutes. When

81
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,920
I reuse an old plastic bottle to make a

82
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,239
tool that helps the orchid revive. This

83
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,000
recycling not only creates a humid and

84
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,640
airy environment that helps the plant

85
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,560
recover faster, but also contributes a

86
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,360
small part to reducing environmental

87
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,680
pollution. A simple action, yet it

88
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,100
brings great meaning to both nature and

89
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:14,369
our own garden.

91
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,000
After that, I wash the growing container

92
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,040
container thoroughly to remove all

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,040
remaining dirt and bacteria.

97

Next, I make a few small ventilation

98
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,840
holes around the sides of the growing

99
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,680

100

circulation, keep the roots well

101

102
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,039
that could cause root rot.

For the growing medium, I choose

carefully sterilized pine bark. Pine

107
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,039
bark helps retain just the right amount

108
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,039
of moisture, provides good irration, and

109
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,240
creates an ideal environment for orchid

110
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,240
roots to grow.

112
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,360
After planting, place the orchid pot in

113
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,759
a cool and well ventilated area avoiding

114
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,080
direct sunlight. Let the plant rest for

115
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,479
about a week without watering.

116
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,319
During this time, the dry pine bark will

117
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,160
naturally absorb a small amount of

118
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,479
moisture from the air, keeping the

119
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,850
orchid roots airy, preventing water

120
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:43,120
logging and stopping further root rot.

At this point, if the roots look dry and

127
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,080
stronger, you can start watering lightly

128
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,680
to keep the orchid moist.

129
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,919
Providing moderate moisture will help

130
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,560
the new roots continue to grow and the

131
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:10,720

You can clearly see that the orchid has

started to sprout a very healthy new

146

Not only that, the plant's new roots

151
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,280
have also started to grow and

152
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,560
