have one liter of the mixture.

60
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,920
The next ingredient is blackstrap

61
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,599
molasses. It's rich in minerals and

62
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,760
helps promote the growth of beneficial

63
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,720
microorganisms during the fermentation

00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,760
process, which in turn enhances the

65
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,760
nourishing effect for your orchid.

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,560
You only need to add one teaspoon of

67
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,319
blackstrap molasses. Just a small amount

68
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,040
is enough to provide excellent energy

69
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,879
for the fermentation process, helping to

70
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,879
create a truly effective natural

71
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,879

stir the mixture well to combine all the

75
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:31,280
ingredients. Then close the lid tightly

76
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:34,390

77
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,700

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,400
right now, I will share with you the

81
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,040
first step in taking care of a new

82
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,360
orchid, helping it adapt quickly, grow

83
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,600
healthily, keep its flowers on the stem

84
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,410
longer, and bloom again soon after the

85
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:59,120
current ones fade.

[Music]

87
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,199
First, take some time to carefully

88
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,960
observe the orchid. If you notice any

89
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,120
leaves that are wilted, turning yellow,

90
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,000
or showing signs of rot, you should

91
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,000
gently trim them off.

92
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,720
Then check the growing medium and the

93
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,880
root system. If the medium is decayed or

94
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,479
too wet, you should replace it to

95
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,400
prevent root rot.

96
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,639
Take a close look at the orchid roots.

97
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,960
Healthy roots are usually silvery white

98
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,960
or light green, while damaged ones will

99
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,960
be dark, mushy, and need to be trimmed

100
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,960
off.

[Music]

102
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,680
Since the growing medium is old spagna

103
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,960
moss and the roots are starting to show

104
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,360
signs of rot, I decided to remove all of

105
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,360
the old medium.

106
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,560
This helps prevent root rot and creates

107
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,520
the best conditions for treating and

108
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,520
caring for the roots properly.

109
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,680
After removing the growing medium, I

110
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:11,860
trimmed off the damaged roots.

be removed to help the plant recover

114
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,690
more quickly and to prevent the damage

115
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,790

After trimming and treating the roots, I

119
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,479
repotted the plant into a new pot.

120
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,440
I wrapped a small amount of new fungus

121
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,520
treated dry moss around the roots. This

122
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,240
layer of moss will gently retain

123
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,479
moisture for the roots while helping the

124
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,120
plant stay stable and adapt more easily

125
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,120
to the new pot.

126
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,199
These new roots will be wrapped and

127
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,199
protected by the layer of moss, helping

128
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,039
to maintain stable moisture and create

129
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,039
an ideal environment for continued root

130
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,039
growth.

131
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,479
Next, I used a growing medium made of

132
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,919
crushed pine bark that has been treated

133
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,919

This type of medium helps retain just

136
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,280
the right amount of moisture, provides

137
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,199
good air flow, and creates ideal

138

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,520
on the surface of the pot. This moss

143
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,000

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,519
bloomed, I gently cut them off so the

193
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,200
plant doesn't waste more energy on them.

194
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,880
This allows it to focus on nourishing

195
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,760
the healthy parts and getting ready for

196
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,760
the next blooming cycle.

198
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,399
When the spent buds are removed, the new

199
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,480
flower spikes receive more nutrients.

200
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,640
This helps the plant focus on nourishing

201
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,560
young shoots, promoting growth, and

202
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,390

208
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,800
Removing the non-functional roots will

209
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,959
help the plant develop new roots more

210
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,940
easily and absorb water and nutrients

211
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:29,869

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,720
After letting the mixture ferment for 1

214
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,480

215
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,240
This is an important step to create a

216
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,000
natural fertilizer that is easy for

217
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,110
orchids to absorb and safe for their

218
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:53,429
growth.

[Music]

220
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,839
First, we need to filter out the residue

221
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,160
from the mixture. This helps make the

222
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,240
solution clearer, easier to use, and

223
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,920
prevents clogging the growing medium or

224
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,920
damaging the roots when watering the

225
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,920
plant.

[Music]

227
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:25,360
After filtering, I dilute the solution

228
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,720
with 3 L of clean water. This ratio

229
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,480
ensures that the nutrients are

230
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,240
sufficient for the plant to absorb

231
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,620
effectively while still being safe for

232
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:41,279
the orchid's sensitive roots.

00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:43,920
[Music]

234
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,079
Step one, use a soft cloth to soak up

235
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:50,279
the diluted solution. Then gently wipe

236
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,279
it over the surface of the leaves.

237
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,440
Wiping the leaves with this mixture

238
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,760
helps remove dust, residue, and even

239
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,639
bacteria that have accumulated on the

240
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,320
leaf surface. When the leaves are clean,

241
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,399
the plant can photosynthesize more

242
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,360
effectively, boosting metabolism and

243
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,360
promoting stronger growth.

244
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,040
Through leaf wiping, a portion of the

245
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,920
nutrients in the mixture will be

246
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:18,000
absorbed through the leaf surface. This

247
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,920
is a quick and effective way to provide

248
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,199
nutrition, especially for orchids that

249
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,199
are recovering or nutrient deficient.

250
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,920
The natural ingredients in the mixture

251
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,839
helped strengthen the leaf's natural

252
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,680
protective layer, making the leaves

253
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,079
healthier and more resistant to fungal

254
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:39,279
infections, pests, and harmful

255
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,720
environmental factors.

256
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,600
You should wipe the leaves with this

257
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,440
mixture twice a month. This frequency is

258
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,600
enough to help the plant absorb

259
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,839
nutrients effectively, boost its

260
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,959
resistance, and still keep the leaves

261
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,959
naturally healthy and well ventilated.

262
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,160
Step two, pour the diluted solution into

263
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,920
a clean spray bottle. Using a spray

264
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,560
bottle helps distribute the nutrients

265
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,399
more evenly across the entire plant from

266
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,050

Many new roots have grown, thick, plump,

383
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,559
and healthy. This is a wonderful sign

384
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,880
that the plant is absorbing nutrients

385
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:39,290
well and is ready for its next growth

386
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,490

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,840
These new roots will help the orchid

389
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,919
anchor firmly into the growing medium,

390
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,240
absorb water and nutrients more

391
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,970
efficiently, and thereby promote the

392
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:08,880
orchid's overall growth and development.

What do you think about the way I

395
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,480
revived these orchids? Feel free to

396
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,120
leave a comment and share your thoughts.

397
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:20,740
I'd love to hear your feedback and learn

398
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:23,360
about your own experiences.

Take care of your orchid pots with all

401
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,840
the love and gentleness in your heart.

402
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,159
When you nurture nature with sincere

403
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:36,440
affection, it will always return the

404
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,440
most wonderful things to you.

405
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,559
Every drop of water, every moment you

406
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,120
spend caring is a small gift that brings

407
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:46,280
life, radiant blooms, and endless joy to

408
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,280
your garden.

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,760
Thank you for watching. Wishing you a

410
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,600
joyful day full of energy and

411
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,000
overflowing with love from your little

412
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,930
garden. Goodbye and see you in the next
