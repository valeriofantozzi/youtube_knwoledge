00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:19,897
In this video, I continue to share methods to help infected orchids recover quickly.

3
00:00:19,897 --> 00:00:29,895
and they continue to bloom all year round.

4
00:00:33,251 --> 00:00:41,892
This is an orchid with rot disease, the leaves at the top are rotten.

5
00:00:47,742 --> 00:00:58,889
I need to cut off all the rotten leaves so they don't spread and rot the entire plant.

6
00:01:24,753 --> 00:01:31,882
and I cut out all the rotten areas.

7
00:01:36,881 --> 00:01:46,879
Remove old growing medium.

8
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:59,877
Remove all rotten roots.

9
00:02:12,874 --> 00:02:12,874
and cut off the flower stalks so that nutrients can be concentrated on growing the sprouts later.

10
00:02:28,871 --> 00:02:38,869
Rinse with water.

11
00:02:58,828 --> 00:03:08,896
Take 1 aloe vera leaf.

12
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:34,891
300ml water.

13
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:46,889
Add 1 teaspoon cinnamon powder.

14
00:03:58,887 --> 00:04:06,885
then puree them.

15
00:04:19,882 --> 00:04:28,881
Filter out residue.

16
00:05:13,082 --> 00:05:22,870
Add water to make 2 liters of solution.

17
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:46,898
Soak the entire orchid in this water for 10 minutes.

18
00:05:46,898 --> 00:05:56,896
This helps eliminate pathogens and stimulates germination and rooting.

19
00:06:05,895 --> 00:06:16,893
After 10 minutes, take it out and dry it.

20
00:06:37,358 --> 00:06:46,887
Then sprinkle cinnamon powder on the cut.

21
00:06:48,886 --> 00:06:58,884
Helps cuts heal quickly and prevents orchids from rotting further.

22
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:22,879
Then I planted the orchid in a new pot.

23
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:42,875
Planting material needs to be soaked and disinfected before planting.

24
00:07:50,990 --> 00:08:00,872
Then place in a cool, well-lit place and do not water for 1 week.

25
00:08:06,871 --> 00:08:09,870
After 1 week.

26
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:16,869
Put 2 liters of water into the jar.

27
00:08:18,868 --> 00:08:28,900
Add 3 teaspoons of rice.

28
00:08:50,853 --> 00:08:59,894
After 1 week of not watering, the cut was dry.

29
00:09:03,215 --> 00:09:12,891
From now on water this once a week.

30
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:28,560
Rice water contains ingredients that help stimulate sprouting and rooting very quickly.

31
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:42,885
Then continue to place the orchid pot on the windowsill or under the sun filter.

32
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:55,882
Regularly spraying water helps maintain appropriate humidity for orchid growth.

33
00:10:10,634 --> 00:10:13,879
2 Months later.

34
00:10:16,218 --> 00:10:26,876
The orchid root has produced two very healthy orchids.

35
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:51,871
Continue watering the orchid with rice water once a week.

36
00:11:05,496 --> 00:11:15,900
Rice water is very suitable for orchids at all stages of growth.

37
00:11:23,898 --> 00:11:26,898
After the next 3 months.

38
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:42,895
A rotten orchid has revived and grown into a very healthy orchid pot.

39
00:11:54,892 --> 00:12:03,890
Orchid leaves from this old root can be removed from the orchid pot to help the orchid grow better.

40
00:12:06,115 --> 00:12:16,888
The orchid has developed many buds.

41
00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:26,886
Thank you for watching the video. Wish you luck and see you in the next videos.
