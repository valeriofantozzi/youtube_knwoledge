Welcome to the happiness garden, where

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,160
every green leaf and every flower tells

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,080
its own story. This is not just a

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,559

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,360
peace, joy, and inspiration to those who

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,359
In this video, I will guide you on how

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,160
to revive weak orchids with yellowing or

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,560
wilting leaves using aloe vera. Because

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,800
inside the aloe vera leaf, there is a

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,199
natural gel rich in nutrients that helps

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,279
stimulate strong root growth and makes

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,560
the wrinkled leaves quickly become firm

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,760
and smooth again.

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,120
You just need to take a small aloe vera

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,200
leaf, then cut it into pieces to prepare

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,200
a wonderful natural fertilizer for your

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,160
Next, take two eggshells because

21
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,640
eggshells contain a lot of organic

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,399
calcium. When combined with aloe vera

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,640
leaves, they will create a natural

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,950
source of nutrients that helps orchids

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,840

After mixing, use a soft cloth soaked in

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,720
the aloe vera and eggshell mixture.

Then, gently wipe both the upper and

68
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,560
lower sides of the leaves. This method

69
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,400
is especially effective for leaves that

70
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,110
are wrinkled from lack of water or

71
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:46,159

Aloe vera gel contains many essential

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,360
vitamins and minerals for the plant. At

75
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,680
the same time, it also has good moisture

76
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,319

regain their vitality.

78
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,920
You can do this every 2 days. If

79
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,319
maintained regularly, the orchid leaves

80
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,400
will always stay green and healthy while

81
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,930

84
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,520
The second method is to use this aloe

85
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,280
vera and eggshell mixture to water

86
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,600

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,120
nutrients naturally and effectively.

89
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,360
For orchids with wrinkled leaves due to

90
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,759
wilting, you just need to water the

91
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,560
plant with the aloe vera solution about

92
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,560
once a week. This method will provide

93
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,360
sufficient vitamins and minerals through

94
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,280
the roots while also acting as a natural

95
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,759
fertilizer that helps the root system

96
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,759
recover quickly.

97
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,639
For orchids that are growing normally,

98
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,039
you only need to water them with aloe

99
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,199
vera about once every 2 weeks. That is

100
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:27,160
enough for the plant to absorb nutrients

101
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,160
without the risk of excess.

103

The third method is to put the mixture

104
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,520
into a spray bottle and mist it onto

105
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,600
wilted orchids about every 2 to 3 days.

106
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,120
This method works like folure feeding,

107
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,470
helping the plant absorb nutrients

108
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:50,029

spray this mixture about once every two

112
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,160

113
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:14,580

You can see a little caterpillar on this

119

leaf, which shows that the new leaf has

120
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,840
become tender and soft, making it a

121
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,840
favorite spot for the caterpillar to

122
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,840
stay.

123
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,639
I gently guided the caterpillar to

124
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,520

started to grow many new roots. These

129
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,639
new roots will help the plant absorb

130
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,560

195
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,399
Then put the sliced banana into a clean

196
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,120
glass jar to start the fertilizer

197
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,120
fermentation process.

198
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,079
Next, pour about 4 cups of water into

199
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,800
the jar, which is equivalent to one

200
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,800

201
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,279
To help the fermentation process happen

202
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,360
faster and prevent the banana from

203
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,360

221
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,839
On the jar lid, make a small ventilation

222
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,160
hole so that the gas produced during

223
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:49,440
fermentation can escape, preventing the

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,680
jar from bursting.

225
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,839
Then place the jar in a cool, airy spot

226
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,839
for about 2 to 3 weeks for the mixture

227
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,839

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,760
And here is the result after about 2

230
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,160
weeks of fermentation. The banana has

231
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,160
completely softened, ensuring the

232
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:12,680

fermented banana mixture and mix it with

237
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,079
four cups of water, equivalent to about

238
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:32,920

241
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,160
Method one, fertilize the orchid roots

242
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,399
directly with the liquid solution made

243
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,639

246
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,839
Simply water each orchid pot with about

247
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,839
10 tablespoons of this solution, which

248
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,410
is enough to ensure the plant receives

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,320
provides plenty of natural vitamins and

253
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,360

fermented bananas helps orchid roots

261
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,920
grow strong, firm, and healthy. When the

262
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,920
roots are healthy, the plant can absorb

263
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,320
more nutrients from the soil or growing

270
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,399
of the soil or orchid growing medium,

271
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,120
making the environment around the roots

272
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,880

273
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,480
supports root development but also

274
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,480
prevents root rot or fungal diseases.

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,560
Additionally, the fermented banana

277
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,839
mixture stimulates the growth of

278
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,000
beneficial microorganisms in the soil,

279
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,440
creating a biological balance and

280
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,839
promoting the natural breakdown of

281
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,760
nutrients. As a result, the orchid

282
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:44,199
absorbs nutrients more effectively and

283
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,199

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,639
Method two,

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,240
you can put the fermented banana mixture

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,000
into a spray bottle and spray it

287
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,320
directly onto the orchid's leaves and

288
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,920

289
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,000
absorb nutrients quickly through the

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,240
will absorb nutrients optimally, grow

381
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,480
balanced from roots to leaves, and be

382
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,080
ready for the next vibrant blooms. This

383
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,240
is the essential foundation for the

384
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,240
orchid to stay healthy, and bloom

385
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,240
consistently.

The potassium in bananas helps orchids

388
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,919
resist drought very effectively. Thanks

389
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,000
to potassium, water is transported

390
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,400
better from the roots to the stems,

391
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,039
leaves, and flowers, helping the blooms

392
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,960
last longer, maintain vibrant colors,

393
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:40,520
and reduce the risk of wilting or

394
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,520
premature fading.

395
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,080
Potassium also stimulates the orchid to

396
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,919
produce more flower buds, helping the

397
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:51,420
plant bloom consistently and increasing

398
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:54,320
the number of flowers on each spike.

404
