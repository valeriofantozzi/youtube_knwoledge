Hello friends. Nice to meet you on my channel.

2
00:00:06,199 --> 00:00:16,897
In this video, I share how to care for orchids so that orchids thrive.

3
00:00:21,587 --> 00:00:28,561
You have seen here a dry orchid.

4
00:00:33,381 --> 00:00:40,359
Maybe they haven't watered this orchid for a long time.

5
00:00:48,609 --> 00:00:54,590
You need to cut off the flower stem

6
00:00:56,872 --> 00:01:03,854
and cut off all damaged roots

7
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:52,511
Then take 1 aloe vera leaf and cut it into thin slices.

8
00:01:52,511 --> 00:02:00,510
This aloe vera gel is great for revitalizing orchids.

9
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:34,370
Put aloe vera in a jar and add 2 liters of warm water

10
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:50,567
Then add 1 spoon of rice

11
00:03:05,272 --> 00:03:13,262
Cover and leave for 1 hour for nutrients to completely dissolve in water

12
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:26,093
1 Hour Later

13
00:03:36,554 --> 00:03:41,523
Step 1: Clean the leaves with this water

14
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:50,321
Aloe vera gel has a very good moisturizing effect.

15
00:03:51,421 --> 00:03:57,420
Helps orchids recover and stay fresh quickly.

16
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:01,986
Step 2:

17
00:04:07,983 --> 00:04:15,950
Soak orchid roots in this water for 30 minutes

18
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:29,062
After 30 minutes

19
00:04:41,812 --> 00:04:51,876
Plant the orchid in another pot using chopped pine bark

20
00:05:10,923 --> 00:05:19,904
And add a little moss to the surface of the orchid pot to help retain moisture better
.

21
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:06,694
Spray rice water and aloe vera gel on the orchid every 3 days.

22
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:22,958
Then water the orchid with rice water and aloe vera gel once a week.

23
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:31,423
On normal days, when the orchid growing medium is dry, you just need to water the orchid regularly.

24
00:06:33,035 --> 00:06:42,021
Place the orchid pot in a cool place with temperature and light from 25-320 degrees Celsius and the orchid will grow quickly.

25
00:06:47,345 --> 00:06:50,319
45 Days Later

26
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:10,315
The orchid grows many new, very healthy roots.

27
00:07:12,315 --> 00:07:21,313
The roots will help absorb water and nutrients better, so the orchid will recover faster.

28
00:07:46,518 --> 00:07:54,506
Continue watering the orchid with rice water and aloe vera gel once a week.

29
00:08:27,402 --> 00:08:35,398
and continue to spray rice water and aloe vera gel on the orchid every 3 days.

30
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:45,986
On weekdays, you only need to water when the orchid growing medium is dry.

31
00:08:59,385 --> 00:09:02,359
3 Months Later

32
00:09:05,934 --> 00:09:12,924
The orchid has completely recovered.

33
00:09:12,924 --> 00:09:18,223
and the flower buds have grown.

34
00:09:35,219 --> 00:09:42,218
Orchid leaves are sturdy and completely green.

35
00:09:44,823 --> 00:09:52,816
Hope the video will help you a lot in recovering weak orchids at home.
