Welcome to my channel

00:00:29,733 --> 00:00:39,726
When orchids are old and have poor resistance, we need to rejuvenate them.

3
00:00:48,866 --> 00:00:58,856
First you need to cut off all damaged leaves and roots.

4
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:58,177
Keep only fresh roots.

5
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:20,106
Onions have very good antiseptic and growth stimulating effects

6
00:02:50,122 --> 00:03:00,100
Take about 20 grams of thinly sliced ​​onion.

7
00:03:08,763 --> 00:03:13,796
Take 1 teaspoon of baking soda.

8
00:03:13,796 --> 00:03:20,601
Helps balance PH levels and eliminate fungal diseases harmful to orchids

9
00:03:23,122 --> 00:03:33,092
Add 2 liters of water at room temperature.

10
00:03:40,816 --> 00:03:45,789
Wait 30 minutes before using

11
00:03:52,726 --> 00:04:02,719
After 30 minutes, filter to remove residue

12
00:04:31,201 --> 00:04:41,178
Then water the orchid with onion water and baking soda

13
00:05:13,115 --> 00:05:23,103
Soak in this water for 30 minutes

14
00:05:54,766 --> 00:06:04,762
Cover the pot with a layer of dry moss

15
00:06:19,441 --> 00:06:29,424
Place the dried moss in this transparent plastic box

16
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:52,952
Leave in a cool place for 1 day without watering

17
00:06:58,933 --> 00:07:01,917
1 Day later

18
00:07:03,587 --> 00:07:13,581
From now on, water your orchids once a week

19
00:07:17,096 --> 00:07:25,079
Or water when the moss is dry

20
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:42,842
Be careful to keep the moss moist. If the moss is waterlogged, the orchid will easily rot.

21
00:07:52,143 --> 00:08:02,139
Then place it in a cool place with enough light for the orchid to grow

22
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:16,569
3 Weeks Later

23
00:08:57,485 --> 00:09:06,459
Many baby orchids have sprouted

24
00:09:25,859 --> 00:09:30,854
Take 2 liters of water at room temperature

25
00:09:34,146 --> 00:09:44,118
Then add 5 spoons of rice

26
00:10:03,948 --> 00:10:13,946
Water the orchid with rice water once a week

27
00:10:15,945 --> 00:10:25,444
Helps stimulate baby orchids to grow and take root quickly

28
00:10:32,842 --> 00:10:42,840
Continue to place in a cool, well-lit place for the orchid to grow

29
00:10:52,237 --> 00:10:56,204
After the next 1 month

30
00:11:03,144 --> 00:11:13,134
The baby orchids grow very healthy.

31
00:11:18,815 --> 00:11:28,798
