To help you have many options when caring for orchids at home with organic fertilizer.

3
00:00:14,898 --> 00:00:22,896
Helps roots grow and bloom with many, long-lasting flowers..

4
00:00:24,896 --> 00:00:32,894
In this video, I continue to share new methods.

00:00:32,894 --> 00:00:42,892
First, please help me by subscribing to the channel, liking and sharing so more people know.

6
00:00:45,891 --> 00:00:55,889
To make this organic fertilizer, I first used corn.

7
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:06,887
This germination will be better.

8
00:01:10,918 --> 00:01:20,884
Using about 10 grams is enough.

9
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:33,882
Then soak in 1 liter of hot water and wait to cool.

10
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,879
AFTER 3 HOURS.

11
00:01:55,878 --> 00:02:06,875
After cooling, puree and filter to remove residue.

12
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:44,868
Add 4 liters of water.

13
00:02:53,899 --> 00:03:03,897
Next I used about 50ml of GE ginger.

14
00:03:22,894 --> 00:03:30,892
Method 1: Apply to the roots.

15
00:03:32,892 --> 00:03:42,890
GE fertilizer from ginger and corn water helps supplement nutrients 

16
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:52,888
and amino acids that are beneficial for orchid growth.

17
00:03:58,044 --> 00:04:08,885
Especially helps stimulate roots and flower buds very well.

18
00:04:14,883 --> 00:04:22,882
Corn is a rich source of natural Nitrogen.

19
00:04:26,082 --> 00:04:36,879
Nitrogen helps orchids develop strong leaves and produce good young plants.

20
00:04:39,777 --> 00:04:50,876
Soaking the orchid for 30 minutes and then lifting the orchid pot will be very good.

21
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:12,872
Method 2: spray on leaves and roots.

22
00:05:16,263 --> 00:05:26,869
Spraying on the top and bottom of leaves helps supplement nutrients through the leaves.

23
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:41,899
Spraying on the roots will help stimulate root growth and the amino acids in GE ginger also protect the roots from rot.

24
00:05:55,897 --> 00:06:02,895
Method 3: You can water the soil for flowers planted on the ground.

25
00:06:05,205 --> 00:06:16,893
This fertilizer is also very good for flower plants grown in soil such as chrysanthemums, roses, sunflowers...

26
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:22,891
RUSULT.

27
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:34,889
After 1 month of applying this fertilizer, the orchid has grown many new roots.

28
00:06:40,888 --> 00:06:50,886
This helps orchids absorb the most nutrients.

29
00:07:00,112 --> 00:07:08,882
The flower color is more vibrant than usual.

30
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:18,208
bloom many flowers.

31
00:07:28,578 --> 00:07:36,877
The flowers stay on the branches for a long time before fading.

32
00:07:48,907 --> 00:07:58,872
My chrysanthemums and sunflowers also bloomed profusely.

33
00:08:04,871 --> 00:08:14,869
The flower colors are also more vibrant than usual.

34
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:26,900
