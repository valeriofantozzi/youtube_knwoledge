120
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,399
Rice contains many nutrients such as

potassium, phosphorus, and protein,

122
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,000

212
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,160
After buying the orchid, the orchid has

213
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,160
finished blooming and entered the

214
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,600

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:14,670
When transplanted to a new pot, these

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
the roots will rot very quickly. So,
