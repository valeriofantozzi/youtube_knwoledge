Hello friends.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,899
Nice to meet you on my channel.

3
00:00:08,899 --> 00:00:15,897
You see here a withered orchid.

4
00:00:15,897 --> 00:00:22,896
Maybe it's because you didn't water it.

5
00:00:22,896 --> 00:00:31,894
or due to direct sunlight shining on the orchid.

6
00:00:31,894 --> 00:00:40,892
If you want orchids to be nourished and grow quickly.

7
00:00:40,892 --> 00:00:47,891
Please watch this video carefully.

8
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:55,490
Now I will share this amazing trick with you.

9
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:14,886
You need 1 aloe vera leaf.

10
00:01:14,886 --> 00:01:28,883
This aloe vera gel is great for reviving orchids.

11
00:01:28,883 --> 00:01:43,880
Now apply aloe vera gel on the top and bottom of the leaf.

12
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:54,878
Aloe vera gel has a very good moisturizing effect.

13
00:01:54,878 --> 00:02:06,875
In addition, aloe vera also contains vitamins A, B, and C

14
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:18,873
and minerals such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.

15
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:30,871
Do this every 5 days and leave the orchid pot in a cool place for 3 weeks.

16
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:43,868
Next, take 1 liter of warm water and put it in the bottle.

17
00:02:43,868 --> 00:03:00,898
Then take 1 spoon of rice and soak it in this water for about 30 minutes.

18
00:03:00,898 --> 00:03:11,896
Let the nutrients in the rice completely dissolve into the water.

19
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:21,894
Chop the remaining aloe vera leaves into small pieces.

20
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:50,888
Then puree with 300ml of water.

21
00:04:06,885 --> 00:04:18,883
Filter out residue half past four Add 2 liters of water at room temperature.

22
00:04:42,956 --> 00:04:54,942
After soaking for 30 minutes, filter this rice water.

23
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:16,871
Mix rice water with aloe vera juice.

24
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:29,868
So I ended up with about 3 liters of this wonderful liquid manure solution.

25
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:09,894
Cover the pot with moss to retain moisture better.

26
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:32,889
Now you use this solution to water the orchid every 5 days.

27
00:06:47,886 --> 00:06:57,884
Soak the orchid pot in this water for 2 hours.

28
00:07:02,981 --> 00:07:12,948
After soaking for 2 hours, remember to lift the orchid pot and place it in a cool place to let the orchid recover.

29
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,879
2 WEEKS LATER.

30
00:07:29,878 --> 00:07:36,877
Fertilize after 2 weeks for fresher orchid leaves.

31
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:46,875
New roots develop very well.

32
00:07:50,874 --> 00:07:59,872
Many new roots are growing.

33
00:08:04,871 --> 00:08:14,869
New roots will help transport water and nutrients from the roots to the stem.

34
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:24,867
If the leaves are provided with enough water and nutrients from the roots,

35
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:32,899
The leaves will gradually become lush again.

36
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:42,897
1 MONTH LATER.

37
00:08:45,896 --> 00:08:55,894
You see the leaves are very fresh.

38
00:09:14,891 --> 00:09:24,889
and the orchid grows a new leaf.

39
00:09:34,887 --> 00:09:38,886
after the next 2 months

40
00:09:39,886 --> 00:09:50,883
The orchid has grown two branches (two buds).

41
00:09:52,883 --> 00:10:02,881
But the leaves at the base have turned yellow so I will cut off these yellow leaves.

42
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:16,878
Instinctively, when an orchid buds, if the plant lacks nutrients,

43
00:10:16,878 --> 00:10:26,876
the base leaves will turn yellow and fall off to provide nutrients for the buds to develop.

44
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:42,873
Now I need to supplement the orchid's nutrition by taking 3 spoons of rice.

45
00:10:47,872 --> 00:10:56,870
Then soak in 2 liters of water at room temperature

46
00:10:58,026 --> 00:11:06,868
and wait 30 minutes for the nutrients to completely dissolve in water before using.

47
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:12,734
30 Minutes Later

48
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:26,898
Add 3 tablespoons of milk

49
00:11:33,896 --> 00:11:43,894
Rice water and milk are excellent sources of nutrients for orchids to grow

50
00:11:50,893 --> 00:12:00,891
Now you water the orchid with this solution once a week to help the orchid recover quickly.

51
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:22,887
After the next 1 month.

52
00:12:23,886 --> 00:12:31,885
After 3-4 times of applying liquid fertilizer from milk and rice water, the orchid had many roots.

53
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:40,350
When the roots grow, they will absorb enough water and nutrients 

54
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:46,882
and the leaves will turn green again very quickly.

55
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:54,880
After the next 1 month.

56
00:12:56,188 --> 00:13:04,878
The orchid grew more leaves and the withered leaves were completely recovered.

57
00:13:06,324 --> 00:13:16,876
Roots grow very healthily.

58
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:36,872
The leaves have completely recovered so they are very sturdy and green.

59
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:46,870
Many buds develop.

60
00:14:18,294 --> 00:14:28,895
The flowers have bright colors and hang on the branches for a long time before fading.

61
00:14:36,264 --> 00:14:42,892
Hope the video will help you a lot.

62
00:14:47,123 --> 00:14:55,890
Thank you for watching the video. Wish you luck and see you in the next videos.
