Hello friends

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,366
Today I will show you how when we need to water the orchid

3
00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:11,298
When the orchid's roots are green like this, the orchid has enough water

4
00:00:11,298 --> 00:00:17,238
The leaves will be green and sturdy

5
00:00:26,501 --> 00:00:31,366
But if the roots turn white, the plant is lacking water

6
00:00:31,366 --> 00:00:35,303
check the potting medium you will find it very dry

7
00:00:35,303 --> 00:00:41,917
Leaves will wilt very quickly if we don't water them in time

8
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:50,060
In this case, we need to quickly water the orchid

9
00:00:52,901 --> 00:00:56,444
HOW TO WATER AS FOLLOWING:

10
00:00:56,444 --> 00:01:02,994
Place the orchid pot in a deep dish and water the substrate completely

11
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:47,803
If the roots are still fresh but the leaves are wilted, we can soak the orchid in water for 20-30 minutes

12
00:01:56,366 --> 00:02:01,343
With pots using moss growing medium, the ability to retain moisture is very good,

13
00:02:01,343 --> 00:02:05,291
so we only need to water enough moisture.

14
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:09,388
and no need to soak.

15
00:02:13,905 --> 00:02:19,073
Eat bananas, don't throw away the peels

16
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:24,404
Banana peel contains a lot of vitamins and minerals:

17
00:02:24,404 --> 00:02:29,020
vitamins A, B, C, E and protein, phosphorus, especially rich in potassium.

18
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:36,334
Potassium resists drought very well, helps the orchid to transport water from the root to the top, so the orchid does not wilt

19
00:02:36,334 --> 00:02:43,062
At the same time, potassium helps to stimulate flower growth and keep flowers fresh for a long time

20
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:04,439
We cut banana peels

21
00:03:08,683 --> 00:03:14,600
Put all banana peels in a jar and pour 500ml of boiled water

22
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,784
Then incubate for 1 day for the nutrients to dissolve into the water

23
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:46,507
5 vitamin b1 tablets mixed with 500ml of filtered water

24
00:03:46,507 --> 00:03:52,433
B1 helps plants to better absorb nutrients

25
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:56,179
and growth regulator

26
00:03:56,179 --> 00:04:00,888
It also stimulates root growth very well

27
00:04:04,038 --> 00:04:12,649
After 1 day of incubation, we mix banana juice with vitamin B1 water to get 1 liter of synthetic organic fertilizer solution.

28
00:04:36,618 --> 00:04:41,611
Divide into a spray bottle

29
00:04:53,118 --> 00:04:58,108
Spray the top and bottom of the leaves evenly

30
00:04:58,108 --> 00:05:06,763
Orchid plants are provided with a part of nutrients that are supplemented through the leaves

31
00:05:06,763 --> 00:05:15,486
At the same time, it also eliminates insects to help the orchid stay green

32
00:05:22,246 --> 00:05:29,616
You can also use a cotton ball soaked in this synthetic organic fertilizer solution to wipe the leaves

33
00:05:29,616 --> 00:05:37,535
Do this 1-2 times a month, the orchid will always be protected and green

34
00:05:58,147 --> 00:06:05,128
Next, you use this liquid synthetic organic fertilizer solution to irrigate the orchid

35
00:06:05,128 --> 00:06:12,964
do 1-2 times a month and combine with other organic fertilizers that I have shared on the channel

36
00:06:12,964 --> 00:06:21,252
It will help orchids easily absorb nutrients

37
00:06:21,252 --> 00:06:27,026
Vitamin B1 helps stimulate root growth

38
00:06:27,026 --> 00:06:33,489
Potassium in banana juice will stimulate flower growth and help flowers stay fresh for a long time

39
00:06:33,489 --> 00:06:39,574
It is truly the perfect formula for the full development of roots, leaves and flowers

40
00:06:39,574 --> 00:06:46,469
It's very good, but you should not overdo it, it will harm the orchid

41
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:54,170
You should only fertilize according to my instructions so that your orchid garden always blooms without affecting the growth of orchids.
