Hello everyone, welcome to the happiness

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,279
garden channel. Today I will share a

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,800
great tip for taking care of orchids

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,559
after the flowers have faded.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,719
This method is especially effective in

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:18,200
helping wilted or weak orchids recover

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,200
and grow quickly.

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,000
This is an orchid that has been attacked

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,240
by insects, causing its leaves to become

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,760
torn and no longer intact as they were

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,679
originally.

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,000
These marks are evidence that the plant

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,680
once had to fight against pests in

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,600
nature.

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,160
And this orchid has also finished its

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,920
previous blooming cycle. The once

18
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,760
vibrant flowers have now faded, making

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,500
way for the plant's period of rest and

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:52,640
energy regeneration.

[Music]

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,800
At this time, we need to cut off the

23
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,960
withered flower spike to prevent the

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,440
plant from wasting energy on a part that

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,039
is no longer necessary.

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,630
This will allow the plant to focus on

27
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:09,810
developing new roots and leaves.

Leaves that are severely damaged or

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,240
starting to turn yellow should also be

31
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,320
gently removed.

32
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,799
Removing damaged leaves helps the orchid

33
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,119
become more ventilated, reduces the risk

34
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,260
of fungal diseases, and allows it to

35
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,320
focus on nourishing the healthy parts.

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,200
of mold appearing around the roots.

45
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,799
This is a warning sign that the plant is

46
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,360
having problems and needs to be treated

47
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,360
promptly to prevent spreading and root

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,360
rot.

49
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,799
Therefore, when growing orchids at home,

50
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,799
we should remove the moss and replace it

51
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:09,479
with a more breathable medium to avoid

52
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,479
water retention that can cause root rot.

Next, we will trim off the damaged

78
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,120
important to sterilize the pruning tools

79
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,000

remove part parts that no longer absorb

conditions for the plant to grow

rinse all the roots under running water.

To treat the orchid before planting, I

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,880
use lemon. You can use either green or

101
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:01,380
yellow lemons as both contain natural

102
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:04,600
acids that gently disinfect the roots.

support the plant's recovery process.

111
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,880
Next, we need to prepare the necessary

112
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,880
tools to dilute the lemon juice.

113
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,360
First, pour 3 L of clean water into a

114
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,440
container. This will serve as the base

115
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,280
to dilute the lemon juice, creating a

116
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,280

118
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,120
Next, add 3 tsp of lemon juice into the

119
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,600
container. This amount is just enough to

120
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:44,520
create a mild disinfecting solution that

121
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,520
cleans the roots without causing damage.

Then stir the solution thoroughly to

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,919
ensure the lemon juice is fully

125
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:00,280
dissolved in the water, maximizing its

effectiveness when soaking the roots.

127
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,240
Step one, use a soft cloth soaked in

128
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:16,759
this solution. Then gently wipe both the

129
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,759
upper and lower surfaces of the leaves.

130
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,639
Wiping the leaves helps remove dust

132

attached to the stem, leaves, roots, and

142
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,199
base of the orchid to suck sap, causing

143
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,440
the plant to weaken, become stunted, and

grow slowly.

145
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,680
This method also helps eliminate scale

146
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,280
insects at an early stage. Scale insects

147
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,440
cling tightly to both the upper and

148
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,759
lower surfaces of the leaves, sucking

149
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:09,919
sap and causing the plant to weaken,

195
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,240
take out the dried moss and pine bark

and let them drain.

197
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,079
This is the final preparation step

198
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:01,640
before replanting the orchid into the

199
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,640
new growing medium.

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,760
Prepare a new pot with drainage holes at

203
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,760
the bottom. This design prevents water

204
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,760
from accumulating and creates a well

205
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,760
ventilated environment for healthy root

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,760

and place the orchid in it, making sure

210
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,760
the roots are nestled within the medium,

211
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,079
but the base of the plant is not buried

212
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,079
too deeply.

When adding the growing medium, gently

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,079
shake the pot so that the pine bark and

217
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,160
moss fill in the gaps around the roots,

218
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,320
helping the plant stay stable and

219
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,710
allowing the roots to have even contact

220
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,279

surface of the growing medium after

224
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,000
planting. This moss layer helps retain

225
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,399
light moisture around the base of the

226
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,920

227
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,920
fresh and more visually appealing look.

You can see dark spots appearing on the

237
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,480
early warning sign, so it needs to be

238
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,680
treated promptly to prevent the spots

239
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:45,120

[Music]

241
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,079
Before treating the dark spots, you need

242
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,639
to sterilize the pruning tools with 90%

243
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,480
alcohol. This helps prevent the spread

244
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,480
of pathogens to other parts of the

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,480
plant.

246
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,160
Then use the sterilized tool to gently

247
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,000
cut off the darkened part of the leaf.

248
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,160
Timely removal will help prevent the

249
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,490
disease from spreading and protect the

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:32,899

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,360
This provides natural disinfection,

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:51,720
helps the cut dry quickly, and prevents

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,720
rot from spreading down to the base.

276
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,520
After that, place the orchid pot in a

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,559
spot with gentle sunlight and good

278
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,319
airflow and avoid watering for 1 week.

279
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,240
This allows the cuts to dry completely

280
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,240

281
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,240

After about 1 to two weeks, once the

283
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,360
roots have stabilized, in addition to

284
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,320
watering, you can gently apply a natural

285
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,320
fertilizer to the orchid uh every 2

286
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,640

And here is the result. After 5 weeks,

289
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,480
the orchid has begun to recover with

290
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,280
clear signs from the roots to the

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,440
You can see that the orchid has grown a

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,600
new leaf at the top. This is a sign that

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,960
