00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,680
I'm very happy to welcome you to my

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:10,680
little garden where every flower is

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,680
cared for with all my love and patience.

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,719
Today I will continue to guide you on

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,199
how to revive weak orchids, those that

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,680
have become exhausted after blooming so

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,840
so they can regain their vitality, grow

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,750
healthily, and get ready for a vibrant

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,560
next blooming season.

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,480
You can easily notice that this orchid

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,840
is wilting. If not revived in time, it

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,840
is very likely that the plant will die.

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,960
When you notice that the orchid is

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,800
wilting, the first and most important

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,360
step is to immediately check the growing

18
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,120
medium and the root system, as these are

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,120
the key factors that will help the plant

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,120
recover.

21
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,800
After checking, I found that the orchid

22
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,720
has a lot of rotting roots. So, we need

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,159
to cut off all the damaged roots so that

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,159
the plant can recover and grow back.

25
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,360
Removing the damaged roots helps stop

26
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,119
the spread of fungi and bacteria while

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,920
also creating favorable conditions for

28
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,680
new healthy roots to grow. This in turn

29
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,240
helps the orchid recover quickly and

30
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,240
continue to thrive.

31
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,960
Next, we need to remove the yellowing

32
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,280
and wilting leaves as this will help the

33
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,320
plant focus its energy on recovering and

34
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,320
developing healthier parts.

36
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,920
Next, we need to cut off the old flower

37
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,039
stems as this will help the plant focus

38
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,120
its nutrients on developing new parts,

39
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:15,480
supporting the recovery process, and

40
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,480
preparing for the next blooming season.

[Music]

42
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,200
After cutting off the damaged roots, we

43
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,400
wash the plant under running water to

44
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,879
remove dirt, bacteria, and mold while

45
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,480
also cleaning the growing medium. This

46
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,800
creates a better environment for the

47
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,800
plant to absorb water and nutrients more

48
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,800
easily.

49
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,760
Now we will prepare fertilizer to help

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,440
restore the health of the orchid,

51
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,800
providing the necessary nutrients for

52
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,800
the plant to grow strong again.

53
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,159
To make natural fertilizer, I use one

54
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:14,519
teaspoon of sugar, which provides a

55
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,519
natural energy source for the plant.

56
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,640
Then dilute it with one liter of water

57
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,599
to create a fertilizer solution that is

58
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,599
easy for the plant to absorb.

[Music]

60
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,400
After preparing the solution, pour it

61
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,879
over and soak the orchid leaves for

62
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,040
about 20 minutes. This helps provide

63
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,040
nutrients directly to the plant, aiding

64
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,560
in the recovery of wilted leaves and

65
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,560
stimulating the growth of new leaves.

66
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,120
This process will help revive the wilted

67
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,439
leaves, making them fresher and

68
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,840
healthier by replenishing energy and

69
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,840
essential nutrients.

70
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,400
Next, take one liter of water to prepare

71
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,840
the second natural fertilizer, which

72
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,000
will provide additional nutrients for

73
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,000
the orchid.

74
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,840
Then add one teaspoon of dry yeast,

75
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,400
which helps stimulate the decomposition

76
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,080
process and improve the soil quality,

77
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,479
creating a favorable environment for the

78
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,479
plant's growth.

79
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,280
Next, add 1 teaspoon of flour.

80
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,160
The combination of flour and yeast in

81
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,000
the water will create a nutrient-rich

82
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,400

about 20 minutes, be sure to remove them

94
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,560
and avoid leaving them in the solution

95
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,479
for too long as this can cause water

96
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,880
logging, making the leaves prone to

97
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,880
rotting and less effective at absorbing

On regular days when the growing medium

209

You can see that many new roots have

222
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:26,279
sprouted, indicating that the orchid is

223
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,279
recovering well and growing strongly.

225
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,720
Although the leaves are still wilted, as

226
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,560
new roots develop, the plant will

227
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,320
gradually recover and start growing new

228
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,000

229
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,000

recovery with natural fertilizer.

237
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,800
As you can see, although the leaves are

238
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,639
still wilted, they have become much

239
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:49,240

241
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,480
The orchid has even grown a new flower

244
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,199

Let's get started.

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,280
When growing orchids, it is impossible

301

to avoid the phenomenon of yellowing

302
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,919

If you have an orchid with yellow or

First, remove all damaged leaves on the
