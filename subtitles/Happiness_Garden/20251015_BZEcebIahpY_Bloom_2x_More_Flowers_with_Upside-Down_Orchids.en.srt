Welcome to the happiness garden. Today I

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,480
will share with you how to grow orchids

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,000
using the inverted planting method. This

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,000
is a technique that helps orchids grow

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,840
healthily and bloom regularly all year

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,440
round.

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,440
With this method, the roots will have

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,680
better air circulation, helping to

9
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,520
absorb nutrients effectively, thereby

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,840
making the plant more vigorous and the

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,000
flowers bloom more brilliantly. Let's

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,000
get started.

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,960
If you have a weak or weak orchid that

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,960
you've been caring for a long time, but

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,920
it still doesn't grow or bloom, then

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,920
follow this method of mine.

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,879
First, we need to check the orchid's

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,879
root system to see if there are any

19
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,879
problems.

20
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,559
Because the roots are the most important

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,879
part that determines the overall health

22
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,719
of the plant. If they are rotten, dry,

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,920
or no longer functioning well, the plant

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,920
will have a hard time growing.

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,160
Healthy roots are usually ivory white or

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,199
fresh green, while damaged roots are

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,199
brown, black, or mushy.

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,119
Then cut off all the damaged roots.

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,520
You can see that the roots of this

30
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,520
orchid are almost completely rotten,

31
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,360
causing the plant to lose its ability to

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,360
absorb water and nutrients from the

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,439
environment.

[Music]

35
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,759
Cutting off the damaged roots helps

36
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,360
prevent the spread of root rot disease,

37
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,920
thereby protecting the healthy remaining

38
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,920
roots of the plant.

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,799
After treating the roots, you should

40
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,320
also cut off the wilted leaves, damaged

41
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,320
leaves, or those showing signs of

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,320
disease.

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,320
Old, dry, or rotten leaves not only

44
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,600
spoil the appearance, but also consume a

45
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,320
lot of the plant's energy without

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,320
providing any benefits.

47
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,119
Removing damaged leaves helps the plant

48
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,280
concentrate nutrients on the healthy

49
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,640
parts while also reducing the risk of

50
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,799
disease spreading from the leaves to

51
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,799
other parts.

entire plant with clean water.

honey and vitamin B1 are completely

85
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,639

205
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,560
not water the plant, but

206
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,240

the plant anchor firmly to the growing

Welcome to part two of the video. In

323
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,559

324
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,640
time to propagate from the flower spike.

325

Next, use a cotton swab to dip into the

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,280
the node that needs stimulation to grow

352
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,200

383
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,799
You can see that the spot where the

384
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,520
garlic juice was applied has formed a

385
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,520
very healthy orchid offshoot. However,

386
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,480
at this stage, the offshoot has not yet

387
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,640
developed visible leaves or roots. This

388
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,960
is an early sign that the new chute is

389
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,030
beginning to grow and is ready for the

390
00:24:52,960 --> 00:25:02,799
next stages of development.

[Music]

392
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,640
And here's the result after the next 2

393
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,559
months.

394
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,760
You can see that the orchid offshoot has

395
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:13,760
grown very healthily on the flower spike

396
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,919
with leaves starting to open clearly and

397
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,600
young roots forming.

398
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,520
This is an important step showing that

399
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:23,720
the new chute is ready to develop into

400
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,720
an independent plant in the future.

401
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,240
Note throughout the process of

402
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,640
stimulating the node to grow into an

403
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,679
orchid offshoot, place the orchid pot in

404
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,679
a shaded area with high humidity as this

405
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,279
helps the young chute form and develop

406
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,200
easily.

407
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,679
Conversely, if the orchid pot is placed

408
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,679
in a sunny area with low humidity, the

409
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,940
plant is more likely to produce flowers

410
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,400
instead of an offshoot.

[Music]

412
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,320
I have also applied this little tip to

413
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,080
another orchid and you can see the

414
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,919
result is that many healthy orchid

415
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,600
offshoots have formed on the flower

416
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,679
spike.

417
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,679
This simple yet effective method helps

418
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:05,400
propagate phelinopsis easily and

419
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,400
naturally at home.

420
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,240
Be persistent in applying these methods

421
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:12,240
and gradually you will have a thriving

422
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,039
and vibrant orchid garden just like

423
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,360
mine. Each offshoot will grow healthy,

424
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:20,919
bloom beautifully, and bring joy when

425
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,919
cared for at home.
