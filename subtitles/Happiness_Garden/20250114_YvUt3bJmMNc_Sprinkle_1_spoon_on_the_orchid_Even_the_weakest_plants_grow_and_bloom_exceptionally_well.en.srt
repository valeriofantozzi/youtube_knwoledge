202
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:44,199
plant in pots to let the Orchid adapt

216
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:47,280
clearly remember to plant the root

217
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,400
higher than the pot so that the Orchid

218
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,919
does not have root

219
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,080
rot that's all I want to share with you
