00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,160
I'm sure many of you have encountered

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,640
the situation where your orchid after

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,040
the flowers have faded looks like it has

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,800
lost all its

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,240
vitality, right? Uh but don't worry.

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,719
Today I will share with you a super

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,760
simple yet effective tip that will help

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,720
your wilting orchid recover quickly and

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,000
grow new roots

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,840
consistently. After the orchid blooms,

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,080
the plant often becomes weak and prone

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,920
to diseases due to the loss of its

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,519
resistance.

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,599
The reason is that throughout the

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,760
blooming process, the the plant has

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,399
expended a lot of energy to nurture

17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,280
those beautiful flowers which reduces

18
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,800
its ability to protect itself. This is

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,000
also the time when we need to provide

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,160
special care to help the plant recover

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,079
and continue to grow

22
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,600
healthily. Uh my orchid is wilting, so

23
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,360
we need to check the roots and the

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,840
growing medium to find the cause of the

25
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,840
wilted leaves.

[Music]

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,400
After checking, I found that the entire

33
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,479
root system was damaged, which made the

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,040
orchid weak and unable to absorb the

35
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,320
necessary nutrients and water, leading

36
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,159
to the wilting of the

37
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:39,439
plant. I need to cut off all the damaged

38
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,200
roots to stop the spread of disease and

39
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,680
help the plant focus its energy on

40
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,680
growing new roots.

Then cut off the old flower stems. This

43
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,920
helps the plant focus its nutrients on

44
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,840
growing new leaves and roots instead of

45
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,640
continuing to nourish the faded flower

46
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,640

water to remove any dirt, bacteria, and

50
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,200
mold left on the stem. This helps clean

51
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,519
the plant, creating favorable conditions

52
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,519

To revive the wilted orchid, I use aloe

56
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,720
vera leaves with gel. As aloe vera gel

57
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,720
is very good for plant recovery.

58
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,360
I apply aloe vera gel all over the

59

wilted orchid as this helps provide

60
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,380

spikes, creating a fresh and vibrant

200
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:43,040
landscape. After soaking the orchid for

201
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,519
20 minutes, remove the plant and use a

202
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,519
soft cloth or clean towel to absorb any

203
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:51,839
remaining water on the leaves and stem.

204
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,600
This helps prevent stem rot, mold, and

205
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,160
ensures the plant doesn't become too

206
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,880

210
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,920
turmeric powder on the cut to help the

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,480
Turmeric powder has antibacterial

healing process while also protecting

215
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,199
the plant from harmful agents like

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,199
bacteria and fungi.

219
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,600
Uh to revive the orchid, I take a clear

220
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,600
cup and fill it with water.

221
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,830
[Music]

222
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,600
Use a plasticcoated steel rod to secure

223
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,920
the orchid after planting it in the

224
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,920
water

225
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:09,040
cup. Secure the orchid to the support

226
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,639
rod. This helps keep the plant stable,

227
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,720
preventing movement during the recovery

228
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,759
process and ensuring the plant doesn't

229
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,440
topple over. The steel rod also prevents

230
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:21,399
the plant from touching the sides of the

231
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,920
cup, minimizing damage to the new

232
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:26,240
roots. Make sure the orchid stem doesn't

233
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,839
touch the water. The moisture rising

234
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,639
from the bottom will create the right

235
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:33,040
humidity to stimulate faster root growth

236
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,279
without causing the plant to rot. This

237
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,519
helps the orchid absorb the necessary

238
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,320
moisture for recovery while keeping the

239
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,880
stem dry, preventing diseases caused by

240
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,120
excess

241
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,880
humidity. Then place the orchid pot in a

242
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,639
spot with gentle sunlight, avoiding

243
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,040
direct sunlight to prevent the plant

244
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,040
from getting

a few simple steps, the orchid has grown

growing

environment for the orchid to grow

298
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,159

299
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:56,440
properly sterilized to prevent bacteria

300
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,440

301
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,559
On top of the orchid pot, sprinkle a

302
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,400
layer of sterilized orchid moss uh to

303
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:22,240
