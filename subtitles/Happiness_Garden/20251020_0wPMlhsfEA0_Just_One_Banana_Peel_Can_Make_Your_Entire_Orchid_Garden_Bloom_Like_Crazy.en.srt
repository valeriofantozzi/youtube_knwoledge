you along.

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,439
Now, let's start exploring together to

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,840
see how simple ingredients in the

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,840
kitchen can turn into a secret for

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,239
growing healthy orchids and making them

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,239
bloom brilliantly.

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,440
To make the fertilizer, you only need

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,040
two bananas. And when you eat the

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,760
bananas, don't rush to throw away the

21
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,079
peels. Keep them to turn into natural

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,120
fertilizer, helping your orchids grow

23
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,120
healthy and bloom brilliantly.

24
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,960
Banana peels contain many beneficial

25
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,680
nutrients that help plants grow

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,080
stronger. They are rich in potassium,

27
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,320
calcium, magnesium along with other

28
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,920
trace minerals which help improve root

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,400
health and stimulate the blooming

30
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,400
process of orchids.

31
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,360
The potassium in banana peels helps

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,040
plants enhance their disease resistance

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,439
while also helping orchids withstand

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,759
unfavorable environmental conditions so

35
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,159
the plants remain healthy and ready for

36
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,159
brilliant blooms.

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,920
The calcium and magnesium in banana

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,000
peels help plants absorb nutrients more

39
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,920
easily while also promoting the

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,840
development of strong and healthy roots,

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,060
creating a solid foundation for orchids

42
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,189
to grow and bloom brilliantly.

[Music]

46
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,680
Next, you should cut the banana peels

47
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,440
into small pieces. This helps the

48
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,680
nutrients dissolve easily in water

49
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,520
during the fermentation, allowing the

50
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,959
orchids to overcome faster and grow

51
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,959
healthy, preparing for brilliant blooms.

52
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,959
After

53
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,159
[Music]

54
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,879
cutting them into small pieces. Put the

55
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,400
banana peels into a clean jar. This

56
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,200
helps the fermentation process take

57
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,150
place safely without bacteria or fungi

58
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,480
spoiling the nutrients.

[Music]

60
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,120
The next ingredient is oats. You only

61
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,959
need three teaspoons. Oats will provide

62
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,510
additional nutrients, helping orchids

63
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:24,310
grow comprehensively and healthier.

[Music]

66
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,879
Now add one liter of water to the jar to

67
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,799
ferment the banana peels with the oats.

68
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,879
This helps the nutrients from both

69
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,319
ingredients dissolve completely,

70
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,840
creating a nutrient-rich natural

71
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,400
fertilizer solution ready for the

72
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,400
orchids to absorb.

00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,490
[Music]

74
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,319
Um, after adding the water, cover the

75
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,000
jar and let it ferment overnight. This

76
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,920
helps the nutrients from the banana

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,080
peels and oats dissolve completely into

78
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,400
the water, creating a nutrient-rich

79
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,120
natural fertilizer solution ready to

80
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,120
nourish healthy orchids.

81
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,440
After one night, stir the solution well.

82
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,759
This helps the nutrients dissolve

83
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,730
evenly, ensuring the orchids absorb the

84
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:43,360
nutrients most effectively.

85
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:45,280
[Music]

86
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,600
Next, strain out the residue from the

87
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,080
solution. This helps the solution become

88
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,479
clearer and penetrate the growing medium

89
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,680
more easily, ensuring the orchids absorb

90
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,680
the nutrients quickly and effectively.

91
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,520
After straining out the residue, add one

92
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,520
liter of water. This helps dilute the

93
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,280
solution to a safe level for orchid

94
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,360
roots while ensuring the nutrients are

95
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,530
evenly absorbed, nourishing healthy

96
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:17,079
plant growth.

[Music]

98
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,600
Step one, pour this liquid fertilizer

99
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,360
mixture into a spray bottle. This makes

100
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,600
it easy to spray the solution onto the

101
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,280
growing medium or directly onto the

102
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,199
orchid roots, ensuring the orchids

103
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,199
absorb the nutrients evenly and

104
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,199
effectively.

[Music]

106
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,560
When spraying the solution onto the

107
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,400
leaves and stems, the nutrients are

108
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,720
absorbed directly, helping increase the

109
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,440
plant's resistance, making the orchids

110
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,600
healthier and uh better able to

111
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,600
withstand pests and harsh environmental

112
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,600
conditions.

113
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,319
When spraying onto the roots and growing

114
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,080
medium, the solution delivers nutrients

115
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,240
deep into the root system, promoting

116
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,800
strong root development, allowing the

117
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,280
plant to absorb water and nutrients more

118
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,280
effectively, preparing for brilliant

119
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,280
blooms.

120
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,560
Spraying the solution over the entire

121
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,800
plant and growing medium also helps

122
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,639
balance moisture, creating an ideal

123
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,639
environment for orchids to grow, thereby

124
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,840
promoting regular blooming and making

125
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,840
the flowers bloom more brilliantly.

126
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,800
Step two, water the liquid fertilizer

127
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,880
mixture directly onto the roots and

128
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,280
growing medium. This helps the nutrients

129
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,960
penetrate deeply into the root system,

130
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,039
ensuring the orchids absorb sufficient

131
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,680
nutrients to grow healthy and prepare

132
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,680
for brilliant blooms.

133
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,240
Uh when watering the roots and growing

134
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,319
medium, the solution delivers nutrients

135
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,280
directly to the root system, helping the

136
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,199
roots grow strong and firm and absorb

137
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,759
water and minerals more effectively,

138
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:27,720
allowing the orchids to grow healthy and

139
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,720
prepare for brilliant blooms.

140
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,360
The natural nutrients from banana peels

141
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,759
and oats help improve the overall health

142
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,560
of the plant. increasing its resistance

143
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,479
to diseases and environmental stress,

144
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,319
helping the orchid stay vibrant even

145
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,319
when light or humidity conditions

146
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,319
change.

147
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,479
Watering with this solution also helps

148
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,560
balance moisture in the growing medium,

149
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:59,520
creating an ideal environment for

150
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,599
beneficial microorganisms to thrive,

151
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:06,280
thereby supporting the natural breakdown

152
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:06,280
of nutrients and nourishing the orchids.

153
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,500
[Applause]

154
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,039
Step three. After spraying or watering,

155
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,120
if water remains on the leaves, gently

156
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,360
wipe with a soft cloth. This helps

157
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,120
prevent leaf rot or mold while keeping

158
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,520
the orchid leaves dry, clean, and

159
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,520
healthy.

160
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,680
Fungi and bacterial diseases often

161
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,120
thrive in a moist environment,

162
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,360
especially on the young leaves of

163
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,519
orchids. When water accumulates on the

164
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,240
leaves, it creates an ideal condition

165
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,000
for fungi and bacteria to grow, which

166
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,000
can harm the health and flowers of the

167
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
orchids.

[Music]

169
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,040
To prevent fungi and bacteria from

170
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,880
growing after watering or spraying, you

171
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,120
should dry the young leaves with a soft

172
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,200
cloth while ensuring the orchids are

173
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,680
placed in a well ventilated area with

174
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,080
gentle light. This helps the leaves dry

175
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,720
quickly, prevents diseases, and keeps

176
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,720
the orchids healthy.

177
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,070
[Music]

178
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,120
Water that accumulates on the leaves is

179
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,920
also an ideal environment for moss and

180
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,160
algae to thrive. Moss and algae not only

181
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,720
reduce the plant's aesthetic beauty, but

182
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,920
can also harm the health of the orchids

183
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,760
if they grow excessively. Therefore,

184
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,440
wiping off the water after watering or

185
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,440
spraying helps prevent this problem

186
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,440
effectively.

187
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,680
It's best to fertilize and water the

188
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,120
plants in the morning or late afternoon

189
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,279
when the temperature and light are

190
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,959
gentle. This helps the plants absorb

191
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,720
nutrients effectively while avoiding

192
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,720
leaf burn or stress from intense

193

After that, soak the orchid pot in this

196
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,839
solution for about 20 minutes. This

197
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:19,480
amount of time is enough for the roots

198
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,480
to absorb water and nutrients optimally.

199
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,040
After 20 minutes, take the orchid pot

200
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,279
out and place it in a spot with with

201
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,519
plenty of natural light. This helps the

202
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,279
plant photosynthesize effectively and

203
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,279
convert nutrients into energy for

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,279

After about 3 weeks, you will start to

207
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:53,519
see a noticeable change. The orchid

208
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,200
leaves become shiny, thick and firm.

209
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,640
This shows that the plant is absorbing

grow. The root system remains healthy,

216
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,399
bright white, and not rotten. This is a

217
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,320
great sign that the orchid is growing

218
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,060

for a strong and thriving orchid and it

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,839
is also a sign that the plant is being

242
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:56,320
cared for properly. Therefore, always

243
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,399
observe and nurture the roots well

244
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,399
