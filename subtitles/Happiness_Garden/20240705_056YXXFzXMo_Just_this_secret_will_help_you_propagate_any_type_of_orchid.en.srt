00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 
Welcome to this video!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,932
This is dendrobium orchid.

3
00:00:07,932 --> 00:00:15,897
an orchid that is said to be beautiful and has a gentle fragrance.

4
00:00:15,897 --> 00:00:23,888
They have the ability to bloom all year round and keep the flowers on the branches for a long time.

5
00:00:23,888 --> 00:00:32,627
If you are looking for an easy way to breed this most beautiful orchid in the world?

6
00:00:33,627 --> 00:00:42,667
Let me show you the simple yet effective secret!

7
00:00:45,923 --> 00:00:55,889
I cut this old orchid to propagate.

8
00:01:47,663 --> 00:02:02,225
Apply toothpaste to the cut to help it heal quickly.

9
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:27,691
then wait for the toothpaste to dry.

10
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:41,490
Recycle plastic bottles into tools to stimulate rooting and sprouting.

11
00:03:54,198 --> 00:04:01,186
Dry cuts.

12
00:04:12,202 --> 00:04:20,182
Take 1 aloe vera leaf.

13
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:48,477
Apply aloe vera gel all over this dry orchid.

14
00:05:14,834 --> 00:05:21,803
Then wait for the aloe vera gel to dry.

15
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:49,531
Put the dry orchid branches into this plastic bottle.

16
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:31,290
Place the bottle here and insert moss around it to help retain moisture.

17
00:07:30,615 --> 00:07:40,609
Water regularly to keep the environment moist.

18
00:07:43,751 --> 00:07:52,740
This helps the orchid germinate faster.

19
00:08:14,347 --> 00:08:23,426
Then put it in a cool place and wait for the orchid to revive.

20
00:08:40,072 --> 00:08:46,063
2 MONTHS LATER

21
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:04,947
With this method, after only 2 months, the old withered orchid branches were revived.

22
00:10:29,991 --> 00:10:39,974
Now I cut them out to plant in pots.

23
00:10:59,603 --> 00:11:08,600
I planted moss soaked in antiseptic and then dried to help prevent the orchids from rotting.

24
00:11:20,866 --> 00:11:30,875

And don't leave because the next section has a lot of great tips

26
00:12:01,891 --> 00:12:05,890
In my hand is a withered orchid branch.

27
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:12,889
And in this video I will share so that you can propagate from any orchid branch.

28
00:12:14,888 --> 00:12:19,887
We cut off the spots that have bloomed

29
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:36,884
Just keep these 3 paragraphs can still sprout

30
00:12:40,883 --> 00:12:46,882
Applying candle solution on the cut will help protect the orchid from rot

31
00:13:29,874 --> 00:13:36,872
Peel off the protective film of the sleeping sprout

32
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:09,899
Use 1 sprig of chopped fresh ginger

33
00:14:25,896 --> 00:14:30,895
500 ml of boiled water

34
00:14:30,895 --> 00:14:32,895
wait 1 day

35
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:57,889
Soak orchids in ginger water for 30 minutes

36
00:15:05,888 --> 00:15:10,887
Soak moss in ginger water for 30 minutes

37
00:15:33,882 --> 00:15:41,881
I use recycled plastic boxes to make miniature greenhouses to help propagate orchids faster

38
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,879
There's a vent here

39
00:16:06,876 --> 00:16:12,875
Put the orchid in a miniature greenhouse and spray it with moisture once a week

40
00:16:17,874 --> 00:16:22,873
Place in a bright place and avoid direct sunlight

41
00:16:22,873 --> 00:16:25,872
21 DAYS AFTER

42
00:16:55,899 --> 00:17:04,898
Continue misting to keep moisture and keep in a light place, avoid direct sunlight

43
00:17:08,897 --> 00:17:11,896
AFTER 1O NEXT DAY

44
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:43,890
Continue misting to keep moisture and keep in a light place, avoid direct sunlight

45
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,889
AFTER 2 NEXT WEEKS

46
00:18:37,879 --> 00:18:44,878
Plant in pots to let the orchid adapt and grow in the outside environment

47
00:19:18,871 --> 00:19:27,869
If you find it interesting, please subscribe to the channel, like, share to let more people know

My videos have subtitles in different languages. Please select the appropriate language to understand the video content clearly

49
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:48,898
Remember to plant the root higher than the pot so that the orchid does not have root rot

50
00:19:50,032 --> 00:19:58,030
If you find this part interesting, please share it with as many people as possible to support me.

51
00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:42,888
Today I show you how to propagate orchids at home from flower branches

52
00:21:03,884 --> 00:21:27,879
Peel off the cover to make sprouts easy to grow

53
00:21:56,873 --> 00:22:04,872
Apply molten candle solution to the cut

54
00:22:05,871 --> 00:22:13,870
Doing so will not allow water to seep into the branches.

55
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:23,868
At the same time, it helps the orchid not to lose water.

56
00:22:26,867 --> 00:22:34,899
Helps protect orchid branches from rot

57
00:22:46,897 --> 00:23:02,893
Use 2 small cloves of garlic

58
00:23:09,892 --> 00:23:13,891
add 1 liter of water at room temperature

59
00:23:15,891 --> 00:23:19,890
puree

60
00:23:24,889 --> 00:23:26,889
filter out residue

61
00:23:31,888 --> 00:23:40,886
Soak orchid branches in garlic water for 20 minutes

62
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:50,884
Garlic contains a number of natural hormones that stimulate the growth of sprouts and roots

63
00:24:03,881 --> 00:24:10,880
Soak moss in garlic water for 20 minutes

64
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:22,878
Garlic contains sulfur compounds and natural antibiotics, which help prevent the growth of harmful bacteria and pests that exist in orchid media.

65
00:24:32,876 --> 00:24:40,874
AFTER 20 MINUTES

66
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:03,869
I recycle plastic boxes as orchid propagating tools

67
00:25:53,893 --> 00:25:59,892
Put the orchid branch here and remember to put the sprout facing up

68
00:26:11,889 --> 00:26:16,888
Put in a cool place for the orchid to revive

69
00:26:28,886 --> 00:26:32,885
AFTER 2 WEEKS

70
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:38,884
Sprouts have grown a bit

71
00:26:45,883 --> 00:26:47,882
Keep misting to keep moisture regularly

72
00:27:02,879 --> 00:27:07,878
Continue to put it in a shady place to wait for the tree to revive

73
00:27:15,877 --> 00:27:19,876
AFTER 3 MONTHS

74
00:27:21,876 --> 00:27:23,875
WOW

75
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:31,874
The orchid has grown into a very healthy seedling

76
00:27:55,869 --> 00:28:07,900
The roots are very big and strong

77
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:15,898
So with only garlic bulbs, we can propagate orchids at home very easily

78
00:28:15,898 --> 00:28:24,896
We don't need to use chemical drugs

79
00:28:27,896 --> 00:28:32,895
In order for the plant to be perennial and not have root rot, I will replant it later

80
00:28:32,895 --> 00:28:43,893
I planted with pine bark and pumice stone so that the roots of the orchid can be ventilated

81
00:29:00,889 --> 00:29:20,885
Just put the orchid on and water to keep it moist

82
00:29:22,885 --> 00:29:31,883
From now on you can take care of it like any other orchid

83
00:29:46,052 --> 00:29:52,046
You can spray mist every day to keep the orchids moist.

84
00:30:29,872 --> 00:30:39,870
When the last orchids on the branches are about to fall.

85
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:48,868
is when I cut branches to propagate orchids from flower stalks.

86
00:30:48,868 --> 00:30:57,899
Where flowers bloom, I cut off to go there.

87
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:06,898
At this node is the place where orchids can be propagated from flower stalks.

88
00:31:13,896 --> 00:31:40,891
I cut it back so the cut doesn't break the cut.

89
00:31:50,889 --> 00:32:02,887
Take 1 Amoxicillin tablet.

90
00:32:21,883 --> 00:32:44,878
Dab the cut with amoxilin to help it heal faster.

91
00:32:50,877 --> 00:32:58,875
Pour into a 500ml bottle of room temperature water.

92
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:08,873
Then mix amocillin in water.

93
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:26,870
This is a plastic seed for growing aquaponic vegetables.

94
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:39,867
Soak in water mixed with amocillin for 30 minutes.

95
00:33:39,867 --> 00:33:47,899
Helps kill fungi and bacteria very well.

96
00:33:51,898 --> 00:34:01,896
In the meantime, I recycle used plastic containers into orchid propagating tools.

97
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:55,886
Peeling off the film helps orchid sprouts to grow more easily.

98
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:50,875
Use a sprig of fresh ginger.

99
00:35:58,873 --> 00:36:09,871
Then squeeze the pure ginger juice.

100
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:31,900
Dip cotton balls in ginger water.

101
00:36:47,897 --> 00:37:03,894
Incubate this button for 5 minutes to stimulate germination and fast rooting.

102
00:37:40,886 --> 00:37:50,884
Put this button on the plastic pellets and spray moisturizing mist every 2 days.

103
00:37:52,884 --> 00:37:58,883
Place the flower pot in a cool and well-lit place.

104
00:38:05,881 --> 00:38:09,881
1 MONTH LATER.

105
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:23,878
Sprouts have sprouted.

106
00:38:26,877 --> 00:38:30,876
But still no roots.

107
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:37,875
Continue misting to moisturize every 2 days.

108
00:38:57,871 --> 00:39:02,870
AFTER THE NEXT 10 DAYS

109
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:12,868
The orchid sprout has grown and has taken root.

110
00:39:29,898 --> 00:39:39,896
But the sprouts are still weak, so I continue to take care of them.

111
00:39:50,894 --> 00:39:54,893
AFTER THE NEXT 2 MONTHS.

112
00:40:00,892 --> 00:40:18,888
Orchids have grown very healthy.

113
00:40:24,887 --> 00:40:38,884
Roots grow very well.

114
00:40:57,881 --> 00:41:08,878
Now I plant it in a pot to let the orchid grow in the natural environment outside.

115
00:41:09,878 --> 00:41:19,876
Using moss that has been sterilized and dried helps protect orchids from rotting

116
00:41:28,875 --> 00:41:38,873
Then water and leave in a cool place with enough light for the orchid to grow.

117
00:41:44,871 --> 00:41:54,869
If you find it interesting, please share it so more people know this tip

118
00:42:03,868 --> 00:42:12,899
Today I share how to propagate orchids from old withered branches

119
00:42:12,899 --> 00:42:22,897
This is a vegetable glue. It prevents water

120
00:42:24,897 --> 00:42:51,891
This is a vegetable glue. It prevents water from seeping inside

121
00:42:51,891 --> 00:43:02,889
You can also replace this glue by burning a candle and putting it on to prevent it from getting waterproof

122
00:43:25,885 --> 00:43:48,880
Scrape off the outer membrane so that the sprouts are easy to germinate.

123
00:44:34,871 --> 00:44:45,869
You use 1 clove of garlic

124
00:44:54,867 --> 00:45:17,896
Apply garlic juice to newly shaved areas to wake up the sprouts

125
00:45:32,893 --> 00:45:39,891
I use a type of moss

126
00:45:39,891 --> 00:45:58,888
Fill with water and check the humidity

127
00:46:01,887 --> 00:46:08,886
Put the orchid branch in

128
00:46:08,886 --> 00:46:20,883
Cover up

129
00:46:20,883 --> 00:46:24,883
Keep in a place with daylight. You must not leave it in direct sunlight

130
00:46:24,883 --> 00:46:27,882
after 1 month

131
00:46:51,877 --> 00:46:59,876
Baby orchids grow healthily and take root very well.

132
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:36,868
Now plant in a pot so the orchid can grow in the outside environment.

133
00:47:42,344 --> 00:47:52,898
Thank you for watching the video. Wish you luck and see you in the next videos.
