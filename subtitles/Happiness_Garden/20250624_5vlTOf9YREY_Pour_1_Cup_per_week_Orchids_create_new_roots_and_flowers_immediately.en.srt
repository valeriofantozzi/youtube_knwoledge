Welcome to the happiness garden, where

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,680
each orchid pot is a little story full

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,400
of hope. When we start growing orchids,

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,080
all of us share a common dream to see

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,840
vibrant blooms throughout all four

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,679
seasons.

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,240
That's why in today's video, I will

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,359
share with you how to care for orchids

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,960
using homemade organic fertilizer. With

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,119
just simple ingredients readily

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,199
available in every kitchen, you can help

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,199
your orchid grow strong from roots to

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,199
blooms.

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,920
By making use of easy to find,

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,000
inexpensive ingredients that still bring

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,600
surprising results, you not only save

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,239
money, but also help care for your

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,239
orchid in a more natural and sustainable

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,239
way.

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,760
The revival of an orchid pot not only

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,840
brings small daily joy, but also

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,920
contributes to creating a fresh,

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,079
peaceful, and vibrant living space

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,520

have you along.

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,159
Let's get started.

31
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,500
[Music]

32
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,439
Uh, the first ingredient I choose to

33
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,759
make natural fertilizer is used coffee

34
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,240
grounds. Those small and seemingly

35
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,000
useless coffee grounds contain many

36
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,680
beneficial nutrients that help improve

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,560
the soil and stimulate root development.

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,640
Just take about 20 g of used coffee

39
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,880
grounds and mix them with one liter of

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,880
warm water.

41
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,159
The second ingredient I use is molasses,

42
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,000
also known as blackstrap molasses. This

43
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,240
is a mineralrich ingredient that

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,479
provides a natural source of energy,

45
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,759
helping orchids absorb nutrients more

46
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,759
effectively and boosting their

47
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,759
resistance.

48
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,200
You only need one teaspoon of blackstrap

49
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,210
molasses to mix with the watering

50
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:19,870
solution.

51
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:19,870
[Music]

52
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,760
The next ingredient is proby yogurt.

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,840
Thanks to its natural probiotics and

54
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,520
enzymes, yogurt helps improve the

55
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,000
microbial environment in the growing

56
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,519
medium, supports nutrient absorption,

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,519
and stimulates stronger root

58
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,519
development.

59
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,680
Just one spoonful of probiotic yogurt is

60
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,680
enough.

61
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,440
After adding all the ingredients, stir

62
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,239
well, cover tightly, and let the mixture

63
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,239
sit for a day to ferment.

64
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,419
[Music]

65
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,400
The fermentation process will activate

66
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,319
beneficial microorganisms, making the

67
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,990
fertilizer more effective when used on

68
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,239
orchids.

69
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,080
[Music]

70
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,000
When an orchid is kept in the same pot

71
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,840
for too long, the roots can easily

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,400
become suffocated and rot due to

73
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,360
prolonged moisture. This can lead to

74
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,360
root rot and leaf decay.

75
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,319
From the outside, the roots may still

76
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,560
look healthy and green, but in reality,

77
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,200
they might have already started to rot

78
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,959
inside. These signs are often hard to

79
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,519
detect without careful inspection, and

80
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,310
the orchid can gradually weaken without

81
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,560
you even realizing it.

[Music]

83
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,360
When the roots are water logged and lack

84
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,200
ventilation, the orchid will quickly

85
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,040
weaken.

86
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,720
The leaves start turning yellow, become

87
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,439
soft and limp, and are highly

88
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,959
susceptible to fungal infections. This

89
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,799
is a clear sign that the growing

90
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:15,000
environment is no longer suitable, and

91
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,000
the plant needs timely rescue.

92
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,479
Therefore, it's best to repot the orchid

93
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,800
after about a year and a half to provide

94
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:28,430
better ventilation and a healthier

95
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:38,510
environment for the plant.

97
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,639
As you can see, white fungal spots have

98
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,800
started to appear on the roots. a clear

99
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:51,199
sign that the orchid pot has become too

100
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,120
cramped and lacks proper ventilation.

101
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,040
When air circulation and moisture are

102
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,960
not balanced, fungal infections can

103
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,800
easily develop and attack the root

104
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,479
system.

105
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,720
At this point, you may also notice some

106
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,720
roots becoming hollow due to internal

107
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,720
rotting.

[Music]

109
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,639
At this stage, what you need to do is

110
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,120
cut off all the damaged, rotten or

111
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,039
hollow roots. This is an important step

112
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,440
to prevent the spread of fungal

113
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,440
infections and to create the conditions

114
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,440
for the orchid to recover in a healthy

115
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,440
way.

116
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,720
Uh with growing media that has been used

117
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,720
for a long time without being replaced

118
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,560
or treated, there is a high risk of

119
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,280
attracting harmful insects, especially

120
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,280
slugs and snails.

121
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,280
Because when the growing medium stays

122
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,039
moist for too long, it forms a slimy

123
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,280
moss layer which becomes an ideal

124
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,840
environment for them to breed and damage

125
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,840

130
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,840
infection. If left untreated, these

131
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,919
infected spots can quickly spread to

132
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:42,520
healthy parts of the leaves, making the

133
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,520
orchid weaker and harder to recover.

After treating the roots and leaves, the

139
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,240
next step is to clean the old growing

140
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,400

eliminate any remaining bacteria, fungi,

144
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,880
for the orchid to grow back healthily.

145
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,639
Just take one teaspoon of baking soda

146
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,960
and mix it with water. Baking soda has

147
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,680
mild antibacterial properties that help

148
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,919
clean the old growing medium and prevent

149
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,530
mold, creating a safer environment for

fungi, and insects before reuse.

157
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,879
Soak the orchid roots and growing medium

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,639
in this mixture for about 20 minutes.

159
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,120
This is the ideal amount of time for the

In addition to its disinfecting effect,

164
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,719
the baking soda solution also helps

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,360
balance the pH in the growing medium. As

a result, the growing environment

167
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,680
becomes more stable, allowing the orchid

168
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,880
roots to absorb nutrients more

169
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,880
effectively and grow healthier.

170
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,720
Uh while waiting for the roots and

171
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,279
growing medium to soak, you can use a

Wiping the leaves with the baking soda

176
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:18,839

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,360
can carry out photosynthesis more

180
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,500
effectively, which in turn supports the

181
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,580

fungal spores and bacteria from the

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,530
to allow the nutrients to penetrate

383
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:22,400
deeply into the roots.

385
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,640
Step three, after spraying and watering,

386
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:29,039
use a soft cloth to gently wipe off any

387
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,600
water droplets on the leaf surfaces and

388
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,600
in the leaf axles.

389
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,679
Wiping off water droplets helps

390
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,320
eliminate moist environments where mold

391
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,559
and bacteria can easily grow. As a

392
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:46,600
result, the leaves stay healthy and are

393
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,600
less prone to fungal diseases.

394
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,000
When the leaves no longer have water

395
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,320
droplets, their surfaces become clean,

396
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,600
allowing light to reach them more easily

397
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,600
and supporting more efficient

398
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,600
photosynthesis.

399
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,880
Water trapped in the leaf axles can

400
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,679
attract small insects like aphids or

401
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,760
mites. Wiping it dry helps reduce the

402
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,960
risk of these pests nesting and harming

403
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:13,280
the plant.

404
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:17,720
Then gently take the orchid pot out and

405
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,720
place it in a spot with gentle sunlight.

406
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,840
Gentle light will help the plant absorb

407
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,240
the necessary energy without causing

408
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:32,919
stress or leaf burn. Creating an ideal

409
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,919
environment for recovery and growth.

[Music]

411
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:57,919
And here is the wonderful result after 3

412
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,520
weeks of care and recovery.

413
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:02,240
You can see the newly developed root

414
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,559
system is dense and healthy, proving the

415
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,559
effectiveness of the care and recovery

416
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,559
process.

417
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:18,880
The leaves become glossy green, healthy,

418
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,480
and firm, reflecting vibrant vitality

419
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,679
and the plant's optimal ability to

420
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,679
absorb nutrients from its surroundings.

421
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,000
This is a clear sign of an orchid that

422
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,000
is recovering well and growing

423
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
healthily.

00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,910
[Music]

425
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,320
These roots will help the orchid absorb

426
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,679
more nutrients, creating a strong

427
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,679
foundation for sustainable growth.

429
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,840

430
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,320

Um, as long as you are patient and care

435
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,720

436
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,960
will not disappoint you. It will bloom

437
