Hello everyone. To keep orchid flowers

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,799
blooming brilliantly and abundantly, the

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,880
first important thing is to help the

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,280
plant develop a really strong root

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,880
system.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,880
When the roots are strong, the plant

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,199
will absorb nutrients better, resulting

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,560
in lush, vibrant leaves and naturally

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,560
preparing for the next blooming season.

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,240
Today I will share with you a very

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,480
simple but effective method that helps

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,320
orchid stems that have finished blooming

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,399
to revive and continue growing

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,960
vigorously.

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,719
As the plant grows stronger day by day,

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,280
more and more new flower buds will

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,320
appear, bringing vibrant beauty and full

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,800
vitality to your orchid pot.

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,640
With this simple care method, you will

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,559
see your orchids start to produce many

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,960
healthy flower buds free from fungal

22
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,719
diseases or insect attacks. The blooms

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,879
are longasting and if cared for

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,760
regularly, the plant can bloom all year

25
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,760

To care for orchids naturally and

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,280
effectively, you can make use of an

29
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,200
orange peel. Orange peel contains

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,840
natural essential oils that can repel

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,600
harmful insects while also providing

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,320
many essential nutrients that help

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,320
orchids grow healthily and produce more

34
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,320

After finally chopping the orange peel,

56
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,480
place it into a clean glass jar. This is

57
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,080
the first step in extracting the

58
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,640
valuable natural essences from the

59
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,160
orange peel, helping the orchid absorb

60
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,490
nutrients gently yet effectively.

Next, pour about one liter of boiling

63
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,680
water into the jar. The high temperature

64
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,760
will help release the essential oils and

65
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,840
nutrients from the orange peel more

66
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,360

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,360
nutrient-rich solution for your orchid.

68
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,000
After that, simply close the lid and let

it sit until the water cools completely.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,319
During this steeping time, the essences

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,560
in the orange peel will gradually infuse

72
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,640
into the water, creating a gentle yet

73
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,430
highly beneficial nutrient mixture for

74
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,479
your orchid.

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,440
Proper moisture helps the roots develop

78
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,760
quickly and allows the plant to absorb

79

nutrients more effectively.

80
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,879
A lack of water makes it difficult for

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,959
orchids to grow healthily.

82
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,760
Once a month, you should soak the plant

83
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,360
to provide deep moisture to the roots.

84
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,040
Pre-watering like this not only helps

soften the growing medium, but also

86
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,430
allows the plant to absorb nutrients

92
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,599
time is enough for the plant to absorb

195
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,880
Uh the honey in the mixture provides a

196
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,560
natural amount of sugars and mild

197
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,279
minerals that can be absorbed through

198
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,399
the leaves. This not only helps the

199
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,160
leaves stay green and healthy, but also

200
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,839
boosts the plant's resistance,

201
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,680
supporting the orchid in developing

202
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,680
strong roots and producing long-lasting

203
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,680
flowers.

204
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,640
Apply this leaf wiping method regularly

205
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,800
twice a month. Regular care will help

206
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,560
keep your orchid clean, healthy, and

207
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,560
blooming more brilliantly.

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,000
As for the second method, you can use

210
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,090
this mixture to water the plant by

211
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:13,200
misting it.

212

[Music]

213
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,200
This method provides gentle moisture and

214
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,240
nutrients spreading evenly over the

215
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,920
stem, leaves, and roots, which is

216
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,920
excellent for the orchid's overall

217
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,920
development.

218
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,320
Uh, when misting, be sure to spray both

219
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,160
sides of the leaves evenly. Many harmful

220
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,680
insects tend to hide on the unders sides

221
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,160
of the leaves where they're less

222
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:40,079

223
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,079
protect the plant more thoroughly.

224
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,279
Since this mixture contains essential

225
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,839
oils from orange peel, spraying it on

226
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,320
the plant will effectively repel harmful

227
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,800
insects such as spiders, aphids, and

228
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,200
thris. Your orchid will be protected in

229
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,279
a more natural and stronger way. This is

230
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,800
also one of the simple organic solutions

231
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:05,959
that helps you care for your beloved

232
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,959
orchids more easily and safely everyday.

233
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,720
When using organic fertilizers, it's

234
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,839
important to be patient. Although the

235
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,760
effects may not appear immediately, over

236
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,320
time, the orchid will gradually recover

237
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:24,040
and develop new, healthy roots, even in

238
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,040
plants that are very weak.

239
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,560
Carry out this care routine regularly,

240
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,320
one to two times each month. A small act

241
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,360
of consistency each month will bring

242
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,360
great vitality to your orchid.

244
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,320
And the third method is to apply this

245
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,079
mixture directly into the orchid pot.

246
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,240
This approach allows the nutrients to

247
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,160
soak deep into the growing medium,

248
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,440
nourishing the roots from within and

249
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,140
supporting the plant's overall

250
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,289
development.

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,240
When watering the mixture into the

253
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,240
growing medium, um, we not only provide

254
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,320
nutrients, but also help prevent root

255
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,040
rot thanks to its natural antibacterial

256
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,440
properties. As a result, the roots will

257
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,440
be protected and grow strongly, creating

258
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,440
a solid foundation for the orchid's

259
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,440
development.

260
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,880
After applying, leave the orchid pot in

261
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,959
this mixture and soak it for about 20

262
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,800
minutes. This amount of time is enough

263
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,360
for the roots to absorb the nutrients

264
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,600
effectively while still being safe with

265
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,220
no risk of water logging or damage to

266
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:39,760

Um, apply this method regularly every 2

269
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,480
weeks. You can also alternate it with

270
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,320
other types of organic fertilizers to

271
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,120
provide your orchid with a variety of

272
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,120
nutrients and promote more well-rounded

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,720
I always recommend prioritizing the use

275
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,880
of organic fertilizers. Although their

276
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,720
their effects may take longer to appear

277
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,480
compared to chemical fertilizers, once

278
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,800
the plant starts growing, it will be

279
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,120
healthier, more resilient, and lush for

280
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,120
the long term.

liquid fertilizer remaining on the

292

301
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,160
The best time to fertilize orchids is

302
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,320
early in the morning. At that time, the

303
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,959

weather is still cool and the humidity

305
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:42,320
in the air is still high. This is when

306
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,160
the roots are most active, allowing for

307
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,959
efficient nutrient absorption without
