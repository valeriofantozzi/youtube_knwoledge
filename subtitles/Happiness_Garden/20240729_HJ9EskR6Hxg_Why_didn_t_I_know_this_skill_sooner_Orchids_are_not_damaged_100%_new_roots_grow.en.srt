Hello friends.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,899
Nice to meet you on my channel.

3
00:00:08,899 --> 00:00:15,897
You see here a withered orchid.

4
00:00:15,897 --> 00:00:22,896
Maybe it's because you didn't water it.

5
00:00:22,896 --> 00:00:31,894
or due to direct sunlight shining on the orchid.

6
00:00:31,894 --> 00:00:40,892
If you want orchids to be nourished and grow quickly.

7
00:00:40,892 --> 00:00:47,891
Please watch this video carefully.

8
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:55,490
Now I will share this amazing trick with you.

9
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:14,886
You need 1 aloe vera leaf.

10
00:01:14,886 --> 00:01:28,883
This aloe vera gel is great for reviving orchids.

11
00:01:28,883 --> 00:01:43,880
Now apply aloe vera gel on the top and bottom of the leaf.

12
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:54,878
Aloe vera gel has a very good moisturizing effect.

13
00:01:54,878 --> 00:02:06,875
In addition, aloe vera also contains vitamins A, B, and C

14
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:18,873
and minerals such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.

15
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:30,871
Do this every 5 days and leave the orchid pot in a cool place for 3 weeks.

16
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:43,868
Next, take 1 liter of warm water and put it in the bottle.

17
00:02:43,868 --> 00:03:00,898
Then take 1 spoon of rice and soak it in this water for about 30 minutes.

18
00:03:00,898 --> 00:03:11,896
Let the nutrients in the rice completely dissolve into the water.

19
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:21,894
Chop the remaining aloe vera leaves into small pieces.

20
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:50,888
Then puree with 300ml of water.

21
00:04:06,885 --> 00:04:18,883
Filter out residue half past four Add 2 liters of water at room temperature.

22
00:04:42,956 --> 00:04:54,942
After soaking for 30 minutes, filter this rice water.

23
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:16,871
Mix rice water with aloe vera juice.

24
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:29,868
So I ended up with about 3 liters of this wonderful liquid manure solution.

25
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:09,894
Cover the pot with moss to retain moisture better.

26
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:32,889
Now you use this solution to water the orchid every 5 days.

27
00:06:47,886 --> 00:06:57,884
Soak the orchid pot in this water for 2 hours.

28
00:07:02,981 --> 00:07:12,948
After soaking for 2 hours, remember to lift the orchid pot and place it in a cool place to let the orchid recover.

29
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,879
2 WEEKS LATER.

30
00:07:29,878 --> 00:07:36,877
Fertilize after 2 weeks for fresher orchid leaves.

31
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:46,875
New roots develop very well.

32
00:07:50,874 --> 00:07:59,872
Many new roots are growing.

33
00:08:04,871 --> 00:08:14,869
New roots will help transport water and nutrients from the roots to the stem.

34
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:24,867
If the leaves are provided with enough water and nutrients from the roots,

35
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:32,899
The leaves will gradually become lush again.

36
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:42,897
1 MONTH LATER.

37
00:08:45,896 --> 00:08:55,894
You see the leaves are very fresh.

38
00:09:14,891 --> 00:09:24,889
and the orchid grows a new leaf.

39
00:09:34,887 --> 00:09:38,886
after the next 2 months

40
00:09:39,886 --> 00:09:50,883
The orchid has grown two branches (two buds).

41
00:09:52,883 --> 00:10:02,881
But the leaves at the base have turned yellow so I will cut off these yellow leaves.

42
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:16,878
Instinctively, when an orchid buds, if the plant lacks nutrients,

43
00:10:16,878 --> 00:10:26,876
the base leaves will turn yellow and fall off to provide nutrients for the buds to develop.

44
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:42,873
Now I need to supplement the orchid's nutrition by taking 3 spoons of rice.

45
00:10:47,872 --> 00:10:56,870
Then soak in 2 liters of water at room temperature

46
00:10:58,026 --> 00:11:06,868
and wait 30 minutes for the nutrients to completely dissolve in water before using.

47
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:12,734
30 Minutes Later

48
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:26,898
Add 3 tablespoons of milk

49
00:11:33,896 --> 00:11:43,894
Rice water and milk are excellent sources of nutrients for orchids to grow

50
00:11:50,893 --> 00:12:00,891
Now you water the orchid with this solution once a week to help the orchid recover quickly.

51
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:22,887
After the next 1 month.

52
00:12:28,886 --> 00:12:38,884
After 3-4 times of applying liquid fertilizer from milk and rice water, the orchid had many roots.

53
00:12:39,883 --> 00:12:47,882
Hope the video will help you a lot.

54
00:12:47,882 --> 00:12:54,880
Thank you for watching the video. Wish you luck and see you in the next videos.

55
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:05,878
Welcome to part 2 of the video

56
00:13:06,878 --> 00:13:14,876
If you have a rotten or damaged orchid and you want to restore it quickly.

57
00:13:14,876 --> 00:13:22,875
And if you don't want to miss any orchid growing tips, subscribe to my channel today.

58
00:13:25,874 --> 00:13:33,872
This is a rotten orchid that people threw away, I picked it up to restore it.

59
00:13:38,871 --> 00:13:46,870
The cause of rot is disease-causing fungi and bacteria.

60
00:13:56,868 --> 00:14:08,899
I remove all damaged roots and damaged leaves.

61
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:32,894
Then rinse with water.

62
00:14:46,891 --> 00:14:55,890
Then hang in a cool place for 2 hours to let the orchid dry naturally.

63
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:06,887
I took 1 aloe vera leaf.

64
00:15:11,886 --> 00:15:20,885
Then filter to get aloe vera jelly.

65
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:33,882
I cut the rest into thin slices.

66
00:15:52,878 --> 00:16:06,875
Then puree with 500ml of water.

67
00:16:20,873 --> 00:16:30,871
Then filter out the residue.

68
00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:47,867
Next I took 3 spoons of rice.

69
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:56,899
Add 500ml of water.

70
00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:06,897
Then leave for 2 hours for the nutrients to completely dissolve in the water.

71
00:17:12,896 --> 00:17:16,895
2 HOURS LATER.

72
00:17:21,894 --> 00:17:31,892
Take aloe vera jelly and wipe the leaves.

73
00:17:33,892 --> 00:17:42,890
This helps wilted orchids recover and grow very quickly.

74
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:52,888
At the same time, it also kills disease-causing bacteria and fungi very effectively.

75
00:18:03,886 --> 00:18:12,884
Mix the two types together.

76
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:42,878
Soak the roots in this water for 30 minutes.

77
00:18:42,878 --> 00:18:51,876
This helps the roots not rot and grow new roots very quickly

78
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:32,868
Then plant the orchid in a new pot for the orchid to recover.

79
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:48,898
Covering the pot with a layer of moss helps retain moisture better.

80
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:06,895
From now on water this once a week.

81
00:20:22,891 --> 00:20:32,889
And spray this water on the leaves once a week.

82
00:20:46,887 --> 00:20:54,885
Place in a light and airy place so the orchid can recover easily.

83
00:21:01,884 --> 00:21:04,883
1 MONTH LATER.

84
00:21:07,882 --> 00:21:16,881
The leaves become stronger and a new leaf grows.

85
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:30,878
And many new roots grow.

86
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:55,873
These new roots help absorb nutrients better, so the orchid will recover very quickly

87
00:22:03,871 --> 00:22:11,870
Continue watering this once a week.

88
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:23,867
and Continue spraying this water once a week.

89
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:39,864
AFTER THE NEXT 2 MONTHS.

90
00:22:40,864 --> 00:22:46,863
This leaf has completely recovered and become lush

91
00:22:52,862 --> 00:23:01,860
The roots grow strongly and produce many new roots.

92
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:12,858
With this simple method, the orchid recovered completely very quickly.

93
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:32,885
Thank you for watching the video. Please share the video so more people know..

94
00:23:37,028 --> 00:23:43,027
