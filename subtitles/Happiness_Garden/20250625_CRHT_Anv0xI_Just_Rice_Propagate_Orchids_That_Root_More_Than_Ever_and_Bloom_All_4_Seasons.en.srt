Welcome to a little corner full of love

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,960
where orchid petals bloom and joy is

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,000
nurtured every day. This is our

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,759
happiness garden. In this video, I will

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,240
continue to share with you a simple way

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,400
to use natural fertilizer to help revive

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,680
orchids that are weak or sick so they

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,680
can recover from roots to leaves.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,279
Let's get started. In summer, when

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,359
humidity and temperature rise, growing

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,439
orchids often comes with the risk of

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,600
fungal infections leading to root rot

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,360
and leaf rot. Uh, one of the common

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,360
diseases that can quickly weaken

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,360
orchids.

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,000
Uh, these rotting leaves often contain a

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,160
large number of fungal spores. If not

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,160
treated in time, uh, they can spread and

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,920
damage the entire orchid plant.

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,079
When you notice signs of disease in your

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,320
orchid, you should quickly isolate the

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,079
pot from the garden or place it away

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,920
from other healthy orchids to prevent

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,719
the spread and create favorable

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,719
conditions for recovery.

completely damaged due to prolonged

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,080
water logging. This is the main reason

50
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,879
why the orchid becomes weak and more

When cutting off the rotting leaf, I

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,599
accidentally damaged the leaf base as

71
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,680

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,760
So, I decided to remove this leaf as

well to prevent the risk of spreading

76
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,760

orchid with water to remove any

84
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,160
Next, I let the orchid dry completely in

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,280
a well ventilated environment before

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,280
proceeding with the next care steps.

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,440
To make fertilizer that helps the orchid

88
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:51,520
recover, I use rice. Um because rice

89
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,040
contains a lot of starch and natural

90
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,600
nutrients that are very beneficial for

91
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,560
root development.

92
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,960
I use 3 teaspoon of rice. This amount is

93
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,880
just enough to create a gentle yet

94
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,280
nutrient-rich fertilizer mixture for the

95
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,520
orchid.

96
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,000
Then I add the rice to one liter of

97
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,479
clean water and let it sit for one day

98
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,400
to allow natural mild fermentation which

99
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,320
creates beneficial microorganisms that

100
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,270
help the orchid roots absorb nutrients

101
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:24,000

129
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,440
with the lightly fermented rice water is

130
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,440
vitamin B1, a nutrient that helps

131
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,000

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,880
Every 5 days, soak the artificial roots

193
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,200
and the orchid stem in the mixture of

194
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,000
lightly fermented rice water and vitamin

195
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,079
B1 for about 20 minutes to provide

196
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,040
nutrients and stimulate consistent root

197
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,040
growth.

[Music]

200
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,000
After that, simply place the orchid back

201
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,480
into the original pot of water and

202
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,480
continue maintaining stable humidity to

203
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,560
support the root growing process.

204
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,560
Place the orchid in a spot with gentle

205
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,639
sunlight and good air flow to enhance

206
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,040
photosynthesis. This will help the

207
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,640
rooting process occur faster and more

208
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,959
vigorously.

210
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:47,390
And here's the result after 1 month.

[Music]

212
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,560
You can see that many new roots have

213
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,880
grown densely. This shows that the

214
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,760
orchid has recovered well and is now

215
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,760
growing strong from within.

[Music]

217
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,000
These new roots will help the orchid

218
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,839
absorb water and nutrients more

219
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,920
effectively, providing a solid

220
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:29,000
foundation for continued growth and

221
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,000
preparation for its next blooming cycle.

224
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,720
And you can also see the leaves have

225
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,959
become glossy green and full of

226
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:15,480
vitality. Additionally, the orchid is

227
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,480
growing new leaves which shows that.

00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,370

229
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,440
What do you think about my method for

230
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,800
restoring weak orchids? Please leave

231
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,040
your comments and share your thoughts

232
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,040
with me.

233
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,880
To help the orchid grow healthy and

234
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,959
bloom brilliantly in the next season,

235
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,959
you should repot it into a larger pot so

236
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,959
the roots have enough space to develop.

237
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,600
I choose a pot with drainage holes at

238
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,360
the bottom to ensure water does not

239
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,320
accumulate, keeping the orchid roots

240
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:54,429
healthy and preventing water logging.

[Music]

243
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,639
I use crushed pine bark as the main

244
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,519
growing medium combined with about 10%

245
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,440
moss uh to help retain moisture and

246
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,150
create a well-errated environment for

247
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:25,350
the roots to develop better.

250
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,120
Uh when planting, gently place the

251
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,920
orchid into the pot to avoid damaging

252
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,920
the newly growing roots.

253
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,839
Then I secure the orchid to a support

254
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,680
stick to keep the stem upright, helping

255
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,920
the roots anchor firmly and grow

256
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,720
steadily.

257
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,519
I spread a bit of moss on the surface of

258
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,839
the orchid pot to help retain moisture

259
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,279
in the growing medium and create a

260
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:59,079
favorable environment for the young

261
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,079
roots to grow faster.

263
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,000
After planting, you can lightly water

264
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,759
the potting medium to keep it moist,

265
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,670
helping the orchid settle in quickly and

266
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:18,160
begin to grow.

[Music]

268
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,160
You need to observe carefully. Only when

269
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,759
the roots have firmly attached to the

270
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,759
growing medium and the plant has

271
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:29,199
stabilized uh should you start

272
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,199
fertilizing the orchid.

273
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,680
Don't forget to place the orchid pot in

274
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,160
a spot with gentle sunlight and good air

275
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,720
flow to support photosynthesis,

276
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:42,160
promote fast root development, and keep

277
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:44,079
the leaves healthy and green.

278
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,000
With patience and proper care, your

279
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,639
orchid will make a strong recovery, grow

280
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,000
lush and green again, and soon bloom

281
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,000
