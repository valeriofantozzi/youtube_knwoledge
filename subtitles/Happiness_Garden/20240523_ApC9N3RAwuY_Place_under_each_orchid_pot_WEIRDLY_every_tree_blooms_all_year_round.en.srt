5
00:00:51,419 --> 00:01:01,244
5 tablets of vitamin B1

6
00:01:04,466 --> 00:01:11,381
1 liter of water at room temperature

7
00:01:25,455 --> 00:01:30,000
Keep in a cool place, away from direct sunlight for 1 hour

8
00:01:39,678 --> 00:01:46,192
I have 5 eggshells in my hand

9
00:01:46,192 --> 00:01:53,167
Eggshells contain many nutrients needed by plants,

10
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:58,786
including calcium, potassium and trace elements such as iron,

11
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:05,482
magnesium, manganese, copper and zinc.

12
00:02:05,482 --> 00:02:10,130
Therefore, it will help provide the necessary nutrients for orchids,

13
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:21,642
Dry on low heat for 5 minutes

14
00:02:35,084 --> 00:02:40,615
This helps to eliminate fungal diseases before using as fertilizer

15
00:02:40,615 --> 00:02:45,569
When using eggshells as fertilizer,

16
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:52,608
it also helps to increase the pH of the soil, helping orchids grow better.

17
00:03:01,171 --> 00:03:15,510
I use 100 grams of compost pressed from animal waste

18
00:03:21,179 --> 00:03:30,000
Mix 2 types together

19
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:42,835
With the orchids that have bloomed all the last flowers

20
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:57,782
I fertilize each pot with 20-30 grams of this compound fertilizer

21
00:03:57,782 --> 00:04:04,366
Orchid after full bloom is very exhausted

22
00:04:04,366 --> 00:04:12,932
so I need to apply this fertilizer to quickly recover

23
00:04:12,932 --> 00:04:18,041
Pay attention to fertilizing far from the root

24
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:25,417
With orchids in full bloom

25
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:32,059
This fertilizer also helps flowers bloom for a long time

26
00:04:32,059 --> 00:04:37,574
If I apply this fertilizer once every 2 months,

27
00:04:37,574 --> 00:04:46,044
I guarantee that the orchid will bloom for 6 months without fading

28
00:04:48,385 --> 00:04:52,780
With orchids with buds

29
00:04:52,780 --> 00:05:08,942
I also apply this fertilizer to help flower buds grow faster

30
00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:18,028
1 HOUR AFTER

31
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:33,556
Decant the clear water above

32
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:43,451
Use this absorbent cotton

33
00:05:44,938 --> 00:05:53,911
Clean the top and bottom of the leaves

34
00:05:53,911 --> 00:06:02,371
Helps eliminate fungal diseases and prevent parasitic insects on leaves

35
00:06:02,371 --> 00:06:11,770
At the same time, it supports the supply of nutrients through orchid leaves

36
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:15,345
Orchids are always green and growing

37
00:06:20,429 --> 00:06:25,795
The rest of the water

38
00:06:25,795 --> 00:06:34,496
Water this water on the orchid growing medium

39
00:06:34,496 --> 00:06:41,060
Vitamin B1 helps strengthen the root system and promote plant health,

40
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:46,170
while improving the soil's ability to absorb nutrients.

41
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:54,590
Vitamin B1 has the effect of protecting plants from external agents such as drought,

42
00:06:54,590 --> 00:07:03,287
sunburn, and cold, and enhances resistance to plant diseases.

43
00:07:03,287 --> 00:07:12,478
You should fertilize B1 for orchids once a month in the cool afternoon

44
00:07:15,232 --> 00:07:18,675
Results after 1 week

45
00:07:18,675 --> 00:07:26,929
Flowers are still very fresh and fragrant than usual

46
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:35,358
These orchids will bloom all year round

47
00:07:35,358 --> 00:07:43,850
This helps me to always enjoy the flowers in bloom

48
00:07:46,140 --> 00:08:03,769
Only a week after using the orchid has grown a lot of new roots

49
00:08:03,769 --> 00:08:24,299
So we can use these organic fertilizers to take care of orchids very well

50
00:08:24,299 --> 00:08:34,025
However, keep in mind that an overdose can also harm plants,

51
00:08:34,025 --> 00:08:39,549
Therefore, it is advisable to adhere to the dosage that I have instructed.

52
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:42,201
Wish you all success and happiness in life.
