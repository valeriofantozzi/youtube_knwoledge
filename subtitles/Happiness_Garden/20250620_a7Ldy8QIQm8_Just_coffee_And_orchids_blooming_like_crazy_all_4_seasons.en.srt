Hello everyone. Today I'm going to share

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,680
with you a simple way to make natural

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,240
fertilizer at home, which will help your

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:12,200
orchids grow healthy, lush, and bloom

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,200
beautifully throughout the garden.

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,000
Thanks to this natural fertilizer, the

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,160
roots and leaves of the plant will stay

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,320
healthy, which in turn helps the orchid

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,320
produce not only more flowers, but also

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,400
longerlasting blooms that retain their

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,359
color and stay on the stem for a long

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,439
time before fading.

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,280
The method is very simple. Anyone can do

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,000
it using familiar ingredients found

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,480
right in the kitchen.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,480
Let's get started.

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,600
The ingredient to make today's natural

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,600
fertilizer is pure ground coffee.

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,719
You just need to put 3 tablesp of ground

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,719
coffee into a clean bottle. The gentle

22
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,879
aroma of coffee is not only pleasant but

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,330
also awakens the vitality of the orchid

24
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:08,479
when used properly.

00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:11,520
[Music]

26
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:14,159
Then pour about 500 ml of boiling water

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,159
into the bottle. The high temperature

28
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,759
will help extract the maximum nutrients

29
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,240
from the coffee, creating a

30
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:24,000
nutrient-rich solution ready to nourish

31
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:27,600
the roots and leaves of the orchid.

[Music]

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,640
Tightly close the lid and let it sit

34
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,479
until the water has completely cooled.

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,880
During this time, the nutrients in the

36
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,280
coffee will slowly infuse into the

37
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,110
water, creating a gentle yet powerful

38
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,680
mixture for your orchid.

blooming stage with its leaves starting

42
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,079
to wilt and weaken. This is the crucial

43
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,399
time to help the plant regain its

44
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:58,210
vitality from the roots to the leaves

45
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:03,680

[Music]

53
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,319
First, you need to cut off the withered

54
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,120
flower spike so the plant no longer has

55
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,200
to use energy to support it. This helps

56
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,680
the orchid focus on recovery and

57
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,680
nourishes the roots and leaves back to

58
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,680
health.

59
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,640
After cutting off the flower spike,

60
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,040
gently check the roots. If the roots are

61
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,920
still healthy, light in color, and have

62
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,680
no strange smell, that's a good sign.

63
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,920
But if there are any rotten or dry

64
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,519
roots, uh you should cut them off to

65
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,160
prevent spreading and help the plant

66
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,160
recover more quickly.

67
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,640
Through this initial inspection, I

68
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,920
noticed that many roots have become

69
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,159
hollow and lifeless. Therefore, it's

70
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,319
necessary to examine the entire root

71
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,640
system more carefully to remove the

72
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:19,159
damaged parts and create the conditions

73
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,159
for the orchid to recover from the base.

74
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,480
Just as I expected when removing the

75
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:29,000
plant from the pot, you can see that

76
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,000
many roots are already damaged.

77
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,000
Now, confidently cut off all the damaged

78
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,159
roots. Removing the rotting roots will

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
help prevent disease from spreading and

80
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,159
allow the plant to develop a new,

81
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,159
healthier root system in the near

82
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,159

In addition to treating the roots, you

85
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:08,200
should also cut off any yellowing or

86
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,200
aged leaves.

87
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,600
These leaves no longer have the ability

88
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,280
to nourish the plant and it may even

89
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,280
drain its energy during the recovery

Before using, you should filter out the

remaining residue in the solution. This

115
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,600
helps prevent the roots from getting

116
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,080
dirty and keeps the solution clean,

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,280
each root cell of the orchid.

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,800
a total of 2 L of solution. Gentle

123
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,479
enough not to burn the roots, yet rich

124
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,039
enough in nutrients to help the plant

Step two, while waiting for the roots to

growing medium for this repotting.

161
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,700

192
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,880
let it drain.

193
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,279
Uh the growing medium should have

194
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,519
moderate moisture, not too dry and not

195
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,600
too wet to create an airy environment

196
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,920
that helps the orchid roots adapt easily

197
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,920
when replanted.

198
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,399
Uh step three, once everything is ready,

199
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,399
gently place the orchid into the new

200
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,399
pot.

201
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,399
Keep the roots neatly inside the pot.

202
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,399
Then slowly add the drained growing

203
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,610
medium around them to secure the plant

204
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:47,580
in place.

208
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,240
Make sure the plant stands firmly but

209
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,040
still has enough space for the roots to

210
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:18,419
breathe and grow.

213
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:40,360
Step four, gently water the orchid pot

214
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,360
with the diluted coffee mixture.

215
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,720
Make sure to evenly distribute the

216
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,800
solution so that every part of the roots

217
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,880
receives these valuable nutrients,

218
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,120
helping the plant recover quickly and

219
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,120
grow healthily.

220
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,399
Uh this solution will provide essential

221
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,040
nutrients helping the plant quickly

222
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,680
recover and develop a strong root system

223
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:05,639
while also stimul stimulating the lush

224
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,639
green growth of the leaves.

225
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,160
Step five, pour the remaining coffee

226
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,680
mixture into a spray bottle.

227
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,000
This will be the solution that allows

228
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,079
you to easily spray the leaves and other

229
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,370
parts of the plant, providing nutrients

230
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:26,880
more evenly and effectively during care.

231
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:29,200
[Music]

232
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,600
Gently spray evenly over the leaves and

233
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,440
stems. This not only provides additional

234
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,959
nutrients, but also adds moisture,

235
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,800
helping the orchid's leaves become

236
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,800
glossy and healthier each day.

237
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,839
Spraying the coffee solution helps

238
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,279
directly supply nutrients to the leaves,

239
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,079
stimulating a more effective

240
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,480
photosynthesis process. As a result, the

241
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,560
orchid's leaves become lush, green,

242
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,199
healthy, and more resistant to harmful

243
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,199
environmental factors.

244
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,399
Step six, after spraying the coffee

245
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,079
solution, gently wipe off the water

246
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,079
droplets on the leaves with a soft

247
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,079
cloth.

248
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,160
Uh, wiping off the water droplets on the

249
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,240
leaves not only helps prevent mold and

250
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,399
bacterial growth, but also avoids leaf

251
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,910
rot or soggess caused by excessive

252
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,760
moisture.

[Music]

254
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,320
At the same time, this helps keep the

255
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,920
orchid leaves dry and well ventilated,

256
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,839
creating favorable conditions for gas

257
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,079
exchange and photosynthesis to occur

258
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,079
more effectively.

259
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,880
Step seven, use a stake or a small

260
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:50,519
plasticcoated metal rod to secure the

261
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,519
orchid in the pot.

[Music]

263
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,240
This helps the plant stand firmly,

264
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,279
preventing it from falling or shifting

265
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,040
when watering or moving. At the same

266
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,199
time, it creates favorable conditions

267
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,180
for the roots to grow stronger and

268
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:29,200
healthier.

271
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,959
Step eight, place the orchid pot in a

272
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,680
spot with gentle sunlight, avoiding

273
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,760
harsh direct rays. Soft light helps the

274
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,759
plant photosynthesize effectively

275
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:53,639
without leaf burn, supporting balanced

276
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,639
recovery and growth.

277
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,199
And here is the result after 3 weeks of

278
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,800
care.

279
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,199
You can see that many new roots have

280
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,800
emerged, a clear sign that the plant is

281
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:14,839
recovering well and starting to grow

282
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,839
again in its new environment.

283
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,079
These new roots will continue to grow

284
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,800
and spread throughout the growing

285
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:27,279
medium, helping the plant absorb water

286
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,120
and nutrients more effectively. They

287
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,519
create a strong foundation for the

288
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,880
orchid to develop new leaves and prepare

289
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,880
for its next blooming cycle.

And as you can see, the leaves have

298
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,120
become glossier and greener thanks to

299
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,279
the nutrients from the coffee and

300
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,039
regular cleaning. This is a sign that

301
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:09,160
the plant is recovering well and

302
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,160
becoming healthier each day.

303
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,760
Although there are still one or two

304
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,480
slightly wilted older leaves, once the

305
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,799
root system grows strong, the plant will

306
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,880
quickly recover these leaves. That's

307
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:25,600
because the roots are the heart that

308
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:30,520
nourishes the entire plant, transporting

309
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,520
water and nutrients to every leaf.

310
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,080
With just patience and a little love

311
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,480
each day, any orchid can be revived,

312
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,799
return to full health, and before long

313
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,799
bloom with vibrant, lively flowers once

314
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,799

315
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,000
Even if you start with a wilted orchid,

316
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,400
you can still turn it into a radiant

317
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,640
gift from nature simply through gentle

318
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:59,000
care from the heart. Miracles always

319
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,000
begin with love and patience.
