00:00:18,406 --> 00:00:21,074
Welcome to my channel

2
00:00:21,074 --> 00:00:27,201
When growing orchids, everyone wants the orchid to grow healthy and flower a lot,

3
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:31,057
And if that's what you want, watch to the end of the video.

4
00:00:31,057 --> 00:00:37,266
Today I will show you how to make a new organic fertilizer, it is made from bell peppers,

5
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:45,134
It's great because it helps the orchid grow and bloom a lot of flowers for you

6
00:00:46,656 --> 00:00:49,393
You see this orchid of mine,

7
00:00:49,393 --> 00:00:52,969
Thanks to the fertilizer I made myself from bell peppers

8
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:56,362
so its leaves are always green and sturdy,

9
00:00:56,362 --> 00:01:05,594
The roots are very large, growing healthy,

10
00:01:08,932 --> 00:01:24,626
grow many buds and do not fall,

11
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:37,398
Flowers bloom brilliantly and long.

12
00:01:37,886 --> 00:01:40,435
 Let's start doing it

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,394
Use 20 grams of bell pepper

14
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:59,366
Add 600ml of water

15
00:02:15,367 --> 00:02:20,639
filter out residue

16
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:28,494
Add water to make 1 liter

17
00:02:28,494 --> 00:02:33,661
Bell peppers contain many vitamins A, C, amino acids and minerals: Calcium, magnesium, zinc.

18
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:40,005
In particular, bell peppers are very high in sugar and phosphorus and potassium

19
00:02:40,987 --> 00:02:45,865
Those are the organic substances necessary for the growth of orchids

20
00:02:48,204 --> 00:02:52,397
Water this once a month

21
00:02:52,397 --> 00:02:56,535
The nutrients in bell peppers will stimulate orchid growth,

22
00:02:56,535 --> 00:03:01,332
The phosphorus content in bell peppers will stimulate the roots to grow very quickly,

23
00:03:01,332 --> 00:03:09,108
The potassium and sugar content will help the orchid transport water and sugar from the roots to the leaves, to the flower branches,

24
00:03:09,108 --> 00:03:16,615
When there is potassium and sugar, the leaves will never wilt,

25
00:03:16,615 --> 00:03:25,997
Flower buds will also not fall when given enough sugar and potassium in bell peppers

26
00:03:32,268 --> 00:03:34,628
This is milk

27
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:37,330
milk without sugar

28
00:03:40,014 --> 00:03:55,814
Mix 30ml milk with 70ml water

29
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:13,817
Clean the surface of orchid leaves with milk

30
00:04:14,615 --> 00:04:19,356
The stomata on the leaves will be ventilated

31
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:26,315
Insects on leaves are also removed

32
00:04:26,928 --> 00:04:33,245
Disease fungi and bacteria on leaves are also eliminated

33
00:04:36,283 --> 00:04:42,663
At the same time, milk is also a very good source of nutrients for plants

34
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,582
Orchids are also provided with nutrients through their leaves

35
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:58,706
so the orchid will always be green and sturdy

36
00:05:01,493 --> 00:05:09,749
Note: it is necessary to thoroughly wipe both the top and bottom of the leaves

37
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:19,050
The underside of the leaf is a humid place, so fungi and bacteria hide and work

38
00:05:20,522 --> 00:05:29,061
Orchids are very susceptible to leaf rot caused by fungi and bacteria

39
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:39,377
The underside of the leaves is also a shelter for insects,

40
00:05:39,377 --> 00:05:47,167
They will destroy the orchid leaves starting here,

41
00:05:49,086 --> 00:05:54,683
They will destroy the orchid leaves starting here,

42
00:05:54,683 --> 00:06:01,301
It will then spread causing the entire leaf to turn yellow

43
00:06:03,595 --> 00:06:05,595
you see

44
00:06:06,071 --> 00:06:10,736
After wiping the green orchid leaves

45
00:06:10,736 --> 00:06:16,414
Orchids will photosynthesize well

46
00:06:16,894 --> 00:06:23,732
Orchid's metabolism will also be better

47
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:35,047
Lan will increase resistance

48
00:06:35,047 --> 00:06:41,862
when the orchid is healthy

49
00:06:41,862 --> 00:06:51,015
and enough nutrition

50
00:06:51,015 --> 00:06:55,332
with good care

51
00:06:55,332 --> 00:07:01,912
When blooming, it will be very fresh and long-lasting.

52
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:43,157
 Healthy roots contribute to good nutrient absorption for orchids

53
00:07:43,157 --> 00:07:59,934
Hope the video content will help you in taking better care of orchids at home

54
00:08:00,989 --> 00:08:06,971
Next I share the video "The faded flowers instantly bloom again in this magical way"

55
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:29,000
With faded flowers like this,

56
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,998
It is possible to let them continue to bloom in a very simple way,

57
00:08:36,998 --> 00:08:48,996
and the orchid is restored to health.

58
00:08:58,994 --> 00:09:00,993
1

59
00:09:01,993 --> 00:09:31,987
First, cut off the spots that no longer bloom

60
00:09:33,987 --> 00:09:37,986
Pick 1 aloe leaf

61
00:09:40,985 --> 00:09:54,983
Apply aloe vera gel to the spot you just cut,

62
00:09:54,983 --> 00:10:10,979
It will disinfect and stimulate germination very quickly.

63
00:10:13,979 --> 00:10:26,976
Let this cut dry naturally.

64
00:10:32,975 --> 00:10:53,971
Peel off the membrane to make sprouts easy to grow.

65
00:10:53,971 --> 00:11:34,996
Then apply aloe vera gel on the places where flowers can grow,

66
00:11:34,996 --> 00:11:59,991
Aloe vera will stimulate flower sprout differentiation very quickly.

67
00:12:15,988 --> 00:12:35,984
Crush aloe vera leaves with 1 liter of water.

68
00:12:45,982 --> 00:12:55,980
Water this once every 2 weeks for the orchid to recover.

69
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:06,978
Combine using other organic fertilizers like peas that I shared on the channel,

70
00:13:07,978 --> 00:13:17,976
for the best orchid growth.

71
00:13:18,976 --> 00:13:44,970
Aloe vera juice also stimulates root development to help plants absorb nutrients faster

72
00:13:52,969 --> 00:14:06,999
After 1 day the cut was dry

73
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:12,998
AFTER 30 DAYS

74
00:14:12,998 --> 00:15:03,988
Withered orchid branches will revive new flower branches like this

75
00:15:06,988 --> 00:15:09,987
AFTER THE NEXT 20 DAYS

76
00:15:09,987 --> 00:15:21,985
Flowers will grow like this.

77
00:15:23,984 --> 00:15:27,983
AFTER THE NEXT 20 DAYS

78
00:15:27,983 --> 00:15:40,981
You will have flowers that continue to bloom like this,

79
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:49,979
So with this simple way, you can let orchids bloom all year round

80
00:15:49,979 --> 00:15:54,978
Hope this sharing content will help you in taking better care of orchids at home.
