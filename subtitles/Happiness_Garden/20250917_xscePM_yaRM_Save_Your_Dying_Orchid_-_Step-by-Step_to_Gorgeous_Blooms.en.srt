When your orchid is rotting like this,

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,760

I guess this orchid is rotting and the

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,920
cause may be due to the plant being

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,920
shocked by inorganic fertilizer. When

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,160
the plant receives too many chemicals at

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,719

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,719

The roots have grown long and dense,

192
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:04,120
showing that the orchid is in a strong

193
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,120
growth phase and completely healthy.

In addition to English dubbing, we have

195

197
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,279
Dutch, Polish, Korean, and Indonesian

198

To hear the language, open the video and

201
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:31,399

204
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,519
Continue caring for the plant with

205
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,680
natural fertilizer so the orchid grows

206
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,780
healthy and quickly blooms with vibrant

207
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:52,079

And here is the result after 6 months of

210
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,480
recovery.

211
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,200
You can see that the leaves are now

212
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,600
shiny and firm from an orchid that once

213
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,519
had root rot and lost all its leaves.

214
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,680
Thanks to consistent care, it has

215
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,160
revived and sprouted a baby plant from

216
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,920
the mother stem. Now, the baby orchid

217
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,480
has grown strong and is blooming

218
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,399
beautifully. A truly proud achievement

219
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,070
and a great source of motivation for

220
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:24,560
orchid lovers.

This shows that as long as you are

223
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,360
patient and care for it properly, even a

224
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,519
weakened orchid can revive and bloom

225
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,279
beautifully again. Keep loving and

226
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,360
caring for them everyday and soon you

227
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,630
will enjoy clusters of fresh, vibrant

228
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,870

orchid has problems. Just care for it

and you will be rewarded with vibrant,

234
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:56,399
healthy blooms. Each time it flowers is

235
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,310
a joy and a well-deserved reward for the

236
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:03,199
effort you've put in.
