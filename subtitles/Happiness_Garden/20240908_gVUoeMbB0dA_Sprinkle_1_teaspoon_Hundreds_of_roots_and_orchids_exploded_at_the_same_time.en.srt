Welcome to my channel!

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:12,898
If you have an orchid after flowering like this, don't rush to throw it away.

3
00:00:15,897 --> 00:00:23,896
Please pay attention and follow me to recover and help the orchids bloom again.

4
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:48,891
Remove old growing medium.

5
00:01:06,887 --> 00:01:12,886
When the moss is green like this, it proves that the humidity in the orchid pot is very suitable.

6
00:01:12,886 --> 00:01:22,884
so I only removed part of the old substrate so the roots could grow faster.

7
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:50,879
If the growing medium is dark green or viscous, it means the humidity is too high, easily rotting the orchid roots

It's great that we can chat together from all over the world!

12
00:02:24,872 --> 00:02:28,871
Cut off all damaged roots.

13
00:02:28,938 --> 00:02:34,936
In addition to the English dub, we've now created dubs in French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, 

14
00:02:34,936 --> 00:02:40,935
Japanese, Hindi, and Indonesian to help you hear and understand the content more easily.

15
00:02:46,851 --> 00:02:55,899
Cutting off wilted flower branches will help the orchid quickly recover and quickly produce new flower branches.

16
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:16,895
These black spots are caused by fungal growth that rots the roots.

17
00:03:19,561 --> 00:03:26,893
When there is too much moisture, fungi will grow and cause root rot.

18
00:03:56,325 --> 00:04:03,886
Upon closer inspection, I saw fungal disease thriving inside the substrate.

19
00:04:08,885 --> 00:04:16,883
Therefore, it is necessary to remove all old planting material so that the fungus does not spread further.

20
00:04:44,877 --> 00:04:51,876
If you encounter any difficulties during the orchid growing process, don't hesitate to comment!

21
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:58,874
 I am always ready to support you so you can grow healthy orchids and bloom lots of flowers. 🌸

22
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:46,899
Then rinse with water helps eliminate some fungal diseases.

23
00:06:38,373 --> 00:06:46,887
Then leave in a cool place for 2 hours to drain.

24
00:06:47,718 --> 00:06:50,886
Next make fertilizer for orchids.

25
00:06:54,885 --> 00:06:58,884
Take 1 spoon of oatmeal.

26
00:07:00,884 --> 00:07:07,883
Add 500ml boiled water (about 2 cups).

27
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:20,880
Wait until it cools before using it as fertilizer.

28
00:07:26,878 --> 00:07:32,877
Take 1 spoon of dry yeast.

29
00:07:35,877 --> 00:07:42,876
Adding 2 cups of warm water (about 500ml of warm water) helps the yeast grow better.

30
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:50,874
Be careful not to use hot water because it will kill the microorganisms in the yeast.

31
00:07:56,873 --> 00:08:02,872
Wait 1 hour for the yeast to develop before using it as fertilizer.

32
00:08:06,871 --> 00:08:09,870
1 Hour later.

33
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:39,898
Filter the oatmeal solution.

34
00:09:00,893 --> 00:09:07,892
Mix the yeast solution with the oatmeal solution.

35
00:09:11,891 --> 00:09:18,890
Add 1 liter of room temperature water (about 4 cups).

36
00:09:26,888 --> 00:09:33,887
Then soak the orchid roots in this solution for 30 minutes.

37
00:09:36,886 --> 00:09:43,885
Beneficial microorganisms in the yeast will protect the roots from rot.

38
00:09:43,885 --> 00:09:50,884
and vitamins and minerals in oats help stimulate rapid rooting.

39
00:09:55,883 --> 00:10:02,881
The remaining solution is used to fertilize other orchids in the garden.

40
00:10:06,684 --> 00:10:12,879
This fertilizer helps stimulate root growth.

41
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:19,878
A strong root system will help orchids absorb nutrients best.

42
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:47,872
You can see that my orchid pots have developed very healthy roots.

43
00:10:54,871 --> 00:11:02,869
This fertilizer also contains a large amount of natural potassium to help bloom more and flowers last longer.

44
00:11:06,868 --> 00:11:14,900
Apply this liquid fertilizer to orchids every 2 weeks for healthy growth.

45
00:11:24,898 --> 00:11:31,897
After soaking for 30 minutes, take the orchid out and plant it in a new pot

46
00:11:40,895 --> 00:11:48,893
I plant with pine bark, which helps drain water quickly and has appropriate moisture so it doesn't cause root rot.

47
00:12:50,881 --> 00:12:58,879
After planting, apply this liquid fertilizer to the orchids every 2 weeks.

48
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:28,873
Place the orchid pot in a place with light sunlight so that the orchid can photosynthesize.

49
00:13:28,873 --> 00:13:33,872
and the orchid will grow faster.

50
00:13:35,873 --> 00:13:43,871
On weekdays, when the foundation is dry, you just need to spray mist to keep it moist.

51
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:50,870
Or watering to keep the substrate moist will help the roots take root quickly.

52
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:06,899
When growing orchids, always follow the principle of "the substrate is moist but not wet," 

53
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:10,898
which will be good for your orchids.

54
00:14:20,897 --> 00:14:23,896
Results after 1 month.

55
00:14:26,895 --> 00:14:33,894
After only 1 month orchid roots have grown many and healthy.

56
00:14:38,266 --> 00:14:45,892
 Leaves become stronger.

57
00:14:47,891 --> 00:14:54,889
These new roots will help the orchid absorb nutrients and water best.

58
00:15:05,755 --> 00:15:13,886
When the leaves and roots grow healthy like this, the orchid will quickly produce new flower branches.

59
00:15:39,395 --> 00:15:46,887
