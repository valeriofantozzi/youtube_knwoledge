00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,119
sufficient nutrients and lives in an

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,520

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,560
Let's get started.

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,640
This is activated charcoal, a natural

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,880
material made from dry wood burned at

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,020

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,920
but also very beneficial for plants.

[Music]

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,720
You only need about 20 g of activated

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,560
charcoal, a small amount that brings

37
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,040
surprising benefits to your orchid.

38
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,880
Add about one liter of water, then blend

39
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,700
thoroughly so the nutrients can easily

40
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:51,060
dissolve into the water.

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,350
clear solution that is easily absorbed

45
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:23,120

leaves clean and beautiful, but also

56

At the same time, activated charcoal

60
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,879
provides a rich source of natural

61
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,200
calcium, helping the leaves become

62
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,760
stronger, shinier, and more resilient to

66
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,720
twice a month to maintain the plant's

67
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,720
health and support steady orchid growth.

68
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,080
The second method, pour the filtered

70
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,160

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,400
roots to stems and leaves to provide

75
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,400
nutrients and protect the plant

77
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,000
The activated charcoal mixture offers

78
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,319
many wonderful benefits for orchids.

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,400
First, it helps clean the leaves and

naturally remove fungi and insects.

81
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,959
In addition, activated charcoal contains

82
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,799
a good amount of calcium, an essential

83
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,440
nutrient that helps leaves become

84
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,919
stronger, shinier, and more resistant to

85
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,519
stress.

86
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,600
Especially when used regularly, this

87
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,680
mixture also helps stimulate strong root

88
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,320

90
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,759
The third method, use this mixture to

91
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,240
water each orchid pot directly, helping

92
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:39,759
the roots absorb nutrients quickly and

93
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,199
nourish the plant from within.

Watering orchids with this mixture

95
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,280
offers many significant benefits. It

96
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,930
helps cleanse the area around the roots

97
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,840

105
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,400
helping the plant absorb nutrients more
