00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,640
Welcome to the happiness garden, where

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,440
every passing moment carries a sense of

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,599
peace, and each orchid pot tells us a

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,599
new story about vitality and gentle

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,599
beauty.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,760
Today, I continue to share how to revive

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,840
orchids after they finish blooming.

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,760
Because once the vibrant flowers fall,

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,920
the plant enters a stage where it needs

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,519
special care to regain energy and begin

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,519
a new, stronger growth cycle.

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,800
After the orchid has finished blooming,

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,760
you should cut off the old flower spike

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,239
as it dies because this helps the plant

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,320
refocus its energy, nourish the roots,

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,520
and prepare for the healthy new shoots

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,520
that will appear soon.

18
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,720
Next, you need to trim off the damaged

19
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,640
roots because removing the weak parts

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,920
will help the plant absorb nutrients

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:14,280
more easily and create space for new

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,280
roots to grow more vigorously. Okay.

23
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,320
You should also cut off the old and

24
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,560
damaged leaves because they can no

25
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,040
longer nourish the plant and only drain

26
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,880
energy that the orchid could use to

27
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,880
develop fresher and healthier new

28
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,880
leaves.

29
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,880
Uh, please let me know in the comments

30
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,439
which country you're watching the video

31
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,280
from. It's wonderful that we can connect

32
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,280
with each other from all around the

33
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,280
world.

orchid growing tips.

38
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,800
It's wonderful to have you with me.

39
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,200
After pruning, place the orchid pot in a

40
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,400
cool, airy spot and let the plant rest

41
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,319
for about 2 to 3 days, 2 3 days without

42
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,400
watering, so the cuts have time to dry

43
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,760
and heal completely before moving on to

44
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,239
the next stage of care.

45
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,160
After 3 days without watering, we will

46
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,920
begin preparing natural fertilizer for

47
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,239
the plant to provide a gentle yet

48
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,959
effective source of nutrients, helping

49
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:52,000
the orchid regain its vitality and soon

50
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:55,040
produce strong new root sprouts.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,200
You just need to add 3 teaspoon of rice

52
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,360
into the bottle. This will be the main

53
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,519
ingredient to create a natural and

54
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,440
gentle source of nutrients that the

55
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:08,720
orchid can absorb very easily.

56
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,560
Add 500 ml of water to the bottle and

57
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,720
let it sit for a few hours, allowing the

58
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,120
rice to ferment slightly and create a

59
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,879
natural source of nutrients that helps

60
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,879
the orchid recover quickly and grow more

61
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,879
vigorously.

62
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,490
[Music]

63
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,040
After the mixture has fermented, strain

64
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,280
out the residue and keep the clear

65
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,970
liquid as this is the pure nutrient that

66
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:04,069
the orchid can absorb easily and safely.

67
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:04,069
[Music]

68
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,560
Next, add another 500 ml of water to the

69
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,720
filtered liquid, helping the solution

70
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,800
become gentler and suitable for watering

71
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,840
orchids without worrying about nutrient

72
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,940
shock.

73
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,940
[Music]

74
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,600
Step one, use a soft cloth soaked in the

75
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,280
diluted fertilizer mixture. Then gently

76
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,440
wipe both the upper and lower sides of

77
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,639
the leaves. This method helps remove

78
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,840
dust, improves nutrient absorption, and

79
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,840
stimulates more effective

80
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,840
photosynthesis.

81
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,840
Wiping the leaves with lightly fermented

82
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,639
rice water helps remove the thin layer

83
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,639
of dust on the leaf surface, allowing

84
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,880
light to reach directly and making

85
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,039
photosynthesis more efficient, helping

86
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,039
the plant recover faster and become

87
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,039
healthier.

88
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,240
The fermented rice water mixture

89
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,400
provides a thin layer of nutrients on

90
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,039
the leaf surface, helping the leaves

91
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,160
retain natural moisture, become softer

92
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:36,680
and shinier, and improve gas exchange,

93
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,680
supporting the plant's overall growth.

94
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,840
The enzymes and minerals in fermented

95
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,000
rice water help strengthen the leaves

96
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,080
resistance, reduce the risk of fungal

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,440
diseases on the surface, and create

98
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,080
conditions for the leaves to grow

99
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,080
greener, thicker, and healthier day by

100
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,080
day.

101
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,639
Step two, pour the diluted mixture into

102
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,800
a spray bottle. Then gently mist both

103
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,800
the upper and lower sides of the leaves.

104
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,479
This helps the nutrients spread evenly,

105
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,080
absorb more quickly, and allows the

106
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:20,120
leaves to receive the full benefits of

107
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,120
the naturally fermented solution.

108
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,039
Spraying the entire orchid with the

109
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,840
fermented rice water mixture helps wash

110
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,919
away any remaining dust after wiping the

111
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,400
leaves, making the leaf surface cleaner

112
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,800
and clearer, allowing the plant to

113
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,919
absorb light optimally and carry out

114
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,919
photosynthesis more effectively.

115
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,600
When sprayed evenly over the stem,

116
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,919
leaves, and aerial roots, the lightly

117
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,479
fermented solution creates a thin layer

118
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,639
of nutrients uh that helps retain

119
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,120
natural moisture, prevents the plant

120
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:03,240
from drying out, and supports a faster

121
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,240
and more stable recovery process.

122
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,440
The minerals and enzymes in fermented

123
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,520
rice water help strengthen the overall

124
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,199
resistance of the plant, limit the

125
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,599
growth of fungal diseases on the leaf

126
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,520
and stem surfaces, and create a

127
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,039
favorable environment for the orchid to

128
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,080
promote the healthy development of new

129
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,080
roots and new leaves.

130
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,639
Step three, take an eggshell that has

131
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,479
been completely dried. Then crush it

132
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,479
into small pieces to make natural

133
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,400
fertilizer.

134
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,400
The calcium in the eggshell will help

135
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,039
the orchid recover better and support

136
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,039
strong root development.

137
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,319
After crushing it, sprinkle the eggshell

138
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,720
over the surface of the orchid pot to

139
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,440
provide a natural source of calcium that

140
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,360
helps stabilize the growing medium while

141
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,599
supporting strong root development,

142
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,000
allowing the roots to anchor firmly and

143
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,639
absorb nutrients more effectively during

144
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,639
the recovery stage.

145
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,959
Additionally, when sprinkled over the

146
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,080
roots and the surface of the pot, Hot

147
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,920
eggshells help repel snails as the tiny

148
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,320
sharp edges prevent them from crawling

149
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,240
over, protecting the orchid's young

150
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,720
roots more safely throughout the

151
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,720
recovery process.

152
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,570
[Music]

153
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,080
Step four, use the diluted fertilizer

154
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,080
mixture to water directly onto the roots

155
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,560
and growing medium, helping the plant

156
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,560
absorb nutrients naturally from below

157
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,880
and stimulating stronger root growth

158
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,880
every day.

159
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,040
Watering the liquid fertilizer mixture

160
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,279
directly onto the roots and growing

161
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,600
medium provides nutrients quickly and

162
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,920
evenly throughout the root system,

163
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,959
thereby promoting the orchid's recovery

164
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,959
and growth after blooming.

165
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,959
The liquid solution penetrates deep into

166
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,200
the growing medium, helping maintain

167
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,800
stable moisture around the roots,

168
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,959
creating an ideal environment for

169
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,640
healthy new root growth and increasing

170
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,640
the absorption of water and essential

171
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,640
minerals.

172
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,760
Regularly watering with liquid

173
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,079
fertilizer also stimulates beneficial

174
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,760
microorganisms in the growing medium,

175
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,399
supporting the decomposition of organic

176
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,720
matter, improving the medium structure,

177
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:44,760
and creating a favorable environment for

178
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,760
the orchid to grow vigorously.

179
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,720
Step five, if water remains on the

180
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,959
leaves after spraying and watering,

181
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,959
gently blot it with a dry cloth to

182
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,200
prevent prolonged moisture that can

183
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,959
cause mold, keeping the leaves clean and

184
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,920
dry and creating conditions for the

185
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,920
orchid to grow healthily.

186
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,920
Depending on your schedule, you can

187
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,000
carry out each step separately or

188
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,920
combine all five steps to care for the

189
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,880
orchid. And it is recommended to apply

190
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,880
this about two to three times per month.

191
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,279
Regular use of this natural fertilizer

192
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,839
will help the plant recover quickly,

193
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,760
keep the leaves glossy and green, and

194
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:35,160
the roots strong, ready for the next

195
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,160
blooming cycles.

196
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,959
After finishing the care, place the

197
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,279
orchid pot in a spot with gentle

198
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,200
sunlight, enough for the plant to

199
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,440
photosynthesize without burning the

200
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:51,800
leaves, helping the orchid absorb energy

201
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,800
and grow steadily each day.

202
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,120
And here are the results after 3 weeks

203
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,959
of caring for the orchid with natural

204
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,279
fertilizer made from lightly fermented

205
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,279
rice water.

206
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,240
You can see that the leaves have become

207
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,399
glossy and sturdy while the roots have

208
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,079
grown vigorously providing a solid

209
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,560
foundation for the new shoots and

210
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,040
upcoming.

211
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,800
>> The glossy healthy leaves show that the

212
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,279
orchid is absorbing nutrients

213
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,600
effectively with both the root system

214
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,000
and leaves developing well while the

215
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:34,360
care environment and natural fertilizer

216
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,360
are truly meeting the plant's needs.

217
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,839
Healthy leaves are an important

218
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,880
foundation for the orchid's overall

219
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,440
development because when they

220
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,000
efficiently absorb light and nutrients,

221
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,200
the plant has enough energy to nourish

222
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,160
the roots, new shoots, and prepare for

223
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,160
the next vibrant flowers.

225
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,839

226

227
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,240

228
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,720
colors of orchids. Each pot showcasing

229
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:20,760
its own beauty, bringing joy and a sense

230

of happiness every day.

231
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,839
And the most wonderful thing is when the

232
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,279
orchid is healthy from roots to leaves,

233
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,760
you will see that it not only blooms

234
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,480
regularly but also maintains longlasting

235
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,880
