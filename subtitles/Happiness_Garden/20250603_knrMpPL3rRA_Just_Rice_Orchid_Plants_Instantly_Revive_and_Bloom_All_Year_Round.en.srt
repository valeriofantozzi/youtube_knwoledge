00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,200
Hello everyone. I am very happy to

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,960
welcome you to my

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,040
channel. Today I will share how to help

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,280
orchid plants recover quickly when they

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,280
face

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,400
rot. With just simple ingredients

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,400
available in every family's kitchen, we

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,039
can easily revive and help orchid plants

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,640
affected by rot to grow back

10
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:26,960
quickly. And then the flowers will bloom

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,679
brilliantly again, continuing to shine

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,880
in your beautiful garden.

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's get

14
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,160
started. For orchid plants that have

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,879
rotted like this, don't rush to throw

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,399
them

17
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:44,239
away. You can notice that in this spot,

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,239
there are always many harmful molds and

19
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,520
[Music]

20
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,600
bacteria. When signs of rot appear, it

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,039
spreads quickly, and if not treated in

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,920
time, the orchid can be seriously

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,920
damaged or even die.

24
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:10,000
[Music]

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,000
We need to completely remove the damaged

26
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,880
leaves. Uh this helps prevent the spread

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,720
of disease uh while also allowing the

28
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,680
orchid to focus on recovering and

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,680
developing healthier parts.

30
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,000
Because the orchid is very weak, we need

31
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,920
to cut off the flower stems to reduce

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,159
the burden, helping the plant

33
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,560
concentrate nutrients and energy on

34
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,560
faster recovery.

35
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,159

world. Uh you can see mold on the

41
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,920
growing medium has started to develop

42
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:15,160
which creates a high risk of root rot

43
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,160
for the orchid.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,520
Since the orchid has been planted in

45
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,920
this pot with the growing medium for a

46
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,480
long time, we need to completely remove

47
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,480
the old medium and replace it with a new

48
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,480

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,170
new roots to develop, contributing to

00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:14,259
the orchid's recovery process.

Um, when you see this leaf has naturally

58
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,040
dried, we don't need to cut it off, but

59
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,040
should leave it as it

60
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,799
is. Next, we need to wash thoroughly to

61
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,799
completely remove dirt and harmful

62
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,799

71
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,780
To disinfect and stimulate root growth,

72
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:45,360
I use natural lemon water.

00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:47,600
[Music]

74
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,160
I dilute lemon water with one liter of

75
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,800
water to create a mild solution that is

76
00:04:50,160 --> 00:05:05,830
safe for the orchid.

81
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,880
Then soak the orchid's roots in the

82
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,280
diluted lemon water solution for about

83
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,510
20 minutes to gently disinfect and

84
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,959
stimulate new root growth.

[Music]

86
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,919
Lemon water contains citric acid and

87
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,240
natural antibacterial agents which help

88
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,639
clean orchid roots, prevent bacteria and

89
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,600
mold, and stimulate healthy new root

90
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:10,170
growth.

00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:10,170
[Music]

92
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,280
The leftover lemon water can be further

93
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,919
diluted with water at a 1:1 ratio to

94
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,919
create a light watering solution, which

95
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,759
both disinfects the growing medium and

96
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,600
supports the recovery process, safely

97
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,759
and naturally, stimulating orchid

98
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,759

101
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,880
Then you can use this solution to spray

102
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,039
on other healthy orchids in the garden,

103
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,950
helping to prevent fungal diseases and

104
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:57,440
boost the plant's resistance.

[Music]

106
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,319
Uh you can absolutely use this solution

107
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,560
to spray on small orchids, mature

108
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,880
orchids as well as orchids that are

109
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,440

For orchids that are blooming, this

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,720
fertilizer helps keep the flowers fresh

114
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,960
longer on the stem because it provides

115
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,280
essential nutrients while also enhancing

116
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,360
the plant's health, helping the flowers

117
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,570
maintain color and freshness for a

118
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:36,649
longer time.

[Music]

120
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,160
Uh besides spraying the upper surface of

121
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,479
the leaves, you also need to pay

122
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,960
attention to spraying thoroughly on the

123
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,639
underside of the leaves as this area is

124
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,039
often damp, creating favorable

125
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,919
conditions for fungi and harmful insects

126
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,919
to gather and develop.

127
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,759
And you should avoid spraying directly

128
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,000
on the flowers because when the flowers

129
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,319
get wet, the petals will quickly wilt

130
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,319
and

fade. After soaking in the solution for

133
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,479
about 20 minutes, take the orchid out

134
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,160
and gently blot with a soft cloth to

135
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,070
wipe off the water droplets on the roots

136
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:56,720

[Music]

138
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,200
Then use melted candle wax to drip onto

139
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,399
the cuts. This helps prevent water from

140
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,760
seeping in, protects the wounds from

141
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:08,000
infection, and prevents rot on the

142
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:33,659
orchid.

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:33,659
[Music]

144
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,360
Next, plant the orchid into a new pot

145
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,200
with drainage holes at the bottom to

146
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,959
ensure the plant does not become water

148
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,160
healthier. After that, I choose to use

149
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,940
dry pine bark as the growing medium for

150
00:09:52,160 --> 00:10:03,909

orchid. After planting with dry pine

153
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,720
bark, we should not water immediately.

154
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,880
This will allow the bark to absorb the

155
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,180
remaining moisture from the roots, keep

156
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:23,079
the roots dry, and reduce the risk of

157
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:26,000
[Music]

158
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:28,000
rot. After planting, place the orchid

159
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,079
pot in a cool, wellventilated area for

160
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,079
about 3 days and do not water.

161
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,279
This helps the plant adjust to the new

162
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,959
environment, allows the cuts to dry

163
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:41,200
completely, and gives the roots time to

164
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:44,399
adapt, thereby reducing the risk of

165
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,399
fungal infection and

166
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:51,360
rot. After 3 days, once the orchid

167
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,279
adjusts, start light watering or use

168
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,490
diluted liquid fertilizer to support

169
00:10:53,279 --> 00:11:00,850

Before applying the liquid fertilizer,

181
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,960
spread a thin layer of moss on the

nutrients more effectively.

189
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,839
Then water the orchid with rice water

190
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,920
two to three times a month. This is a

196
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,120
fertilizer, soak the orchid pot in this

197
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,360
solution for about 20 minutes.

198
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,320
Uh this helps the growing medium and

199
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,680
roots absorb nutrients more deeply while

200
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,760
cleaning and strengthening the root

204
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,040
minutes, take the orchid pot out and

205
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,040
place it in a spot with gentle sunlight

206
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,360
to provide the right temperature that

207
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,630
naturally and effectively promotes

208
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:59,100
recovery.

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,600
And here is the amazing result after one

211
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,279
month of caring for and recovering the

212
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,530
rotten orchid using the natural

213
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,279
fertilizer

[Music]

215
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:17,279
method. You can see the orchid has

216
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,279
revived with a new very healthy chute

217
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,760
growing clearly demonstrating the

218
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:25,080
effectiveness of care and recovery using

219
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,279
natural fertilizer.

[Music]

221
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,839
And the orchid has also grown many new

222
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,320
healthy roots, helping to strengthen the

223
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,839
nutrient absorbing system and create a

224
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,320
solid foundation for the plant's

225
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,320
long-term

226
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,399
growth. Uh, what do you think about my

227
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,000
method for recovering weak orchids?

228
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,279
Please leave your comments and feedback

229
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,279
to let me know.

230
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:07,360
I continue to care for the orchids using

231
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,360
liquid fertilizer made from rice

232
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,760
[Music]

233
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,199
water. When the roots are strong, you

234
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,120
can switch to caring with different

235
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:24,120
natural fertilizers and alternate their

236
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,120
use.

237
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,379
[Music]

238
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,120
This method helps the orchid absorb a

239
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,040
diverse range of essential nutrients

240
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,050
leading to more comprehensive and

241
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:44,080
sustainable

[Music]

243
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,079
growth. Each time after applying liquid

244
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,000
fertilizer, remember to soak the orchid

245
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,000
pot in the solution for about 20

246
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,440
minutes. Then remember to place the

247
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,920
orchid pot in a spot with gentle

248
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,560
sunlight because without enough light,

249
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,120
the orchid cannot metabolize and absorb

250
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:13,240
nutrients effectively, slowing down the

251
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,240
recovery and growth process.

252
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,880
And here's the result after 3 months of

253
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,079
caring for and recovering the weak

254
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,079

256
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:30,320
fertilizer. You can see that the root

257
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,680
system has developed healthily uh

258
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,680
looking fresh and full of

259
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:39,600

260
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:42,000
glossy and firm reflecting the plant's

261
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,639
strong vitality after the recovery
