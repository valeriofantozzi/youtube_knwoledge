00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,160
Welcome to the channel. Today I will

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,319
share how to care for orchids after the

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,760
flowers have faded so the plant can

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:12,000
continue to grow and bloom again soon.

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,799
In my hand is an orchid spike that has

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,600
lost all its petals, leaving only the

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,119
bare stem. To help the plant produce new

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,490
flowers, we need to cut off the old

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:33,920
flower nodes that have already bloomed.

10
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:35,840
[Music]

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,160
We only keep the note of never bloomed

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,440
because it is from from these nodes that

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,040
a new flower spike may emerge.

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,840
Uh at the same time, we should also

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,600
gently peel off the thin outer layer to

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,960
to create better conditions for the new

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,960
flower bud to develop easily.

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,840
After cutting, the wound on the stem

19
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,359
should be left to dry naturally.

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,600
During this time, you should avoid

21
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,000
watering to prevent the cut from

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,479
becoming moist and susceptible to fungal

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,200
infection.

24
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,600
Uh, this is a sprouted potato. These

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,119
sprouts contain a high amount of oxin, a

26
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,210
plant hormone that helps stimulate

27
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:27,840
growth.

28
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:30,960
[Music]

29
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,640
I will add 20 g of fresh ginger, a

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,720
natural ingredient that helps with

31
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,119
antibacterial action and supports

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,680
healthy plant growth.

33
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:44,600
Next, I add 6 L of room temperature

34
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,600
water to easily blend the ingredients.

35
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,119
Blend all the ingredients until you get

36
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,119
a smooth mixture.

37
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,900
Strain out the pulp to obtain the liquid

38
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:09,440
solution.

39
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:12,400
[Music]

40
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,920
Next, I add another 0.6 6 L of room

41
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,319
temperature water to dilute the

42
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,360
solution, making it easier for the plant

43
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:22,239
to absorb.

44
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,920
The first method is to dip cotton into

45
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,239
the mixture, then wrap it around the

46
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,170
nodes on the stem that contain dormant

47
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:33,200
buds.

00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:35,280
[Music]

49
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,610
This will help stimulate those buds to

50
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:43,760
grow and develop into new flower spikes.

[Music]

63
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,640
Uh every 7 days you should apply this

64
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,740
mixture once to the nodes to promote the

65
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:49,539
flowering process.

68
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,680
The second method, pour the mixture into

69
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,079
a spray bottle and mist it evenly on the

70
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,880
leaves, stem, and roots to nourish the

71
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:30,029
entire plant.

00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:30,029
[Music]

73
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,479
However, you should not spray it on the

74
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,880
flowers as it may cause them to wilt and

75
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,880
fall off quickly.

[Music]

77
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,520
Potato sprouts contain many essential

78
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,080
nutrients for plants such as oxin,

79
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,680
vitamins, and minerals, which help

80
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,600
stimulate root growth, promote

81
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,600
development, and enhance the plant's

82
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,600
resistance.

83
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,919
Potato sprouts also contain natural

84
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,440
nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium,

85
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,919
essential nutrients that help plants

86
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,280
develop strong roots, green leaves, and

87
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,280
stimulate flowering.

[Music]

89
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,960
The third method, pour the mixture

90
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,520
directly onto the roots to nourish the

91
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,520
plant from the base.

92

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,759

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,930
roots, and surface of the growing medium

95
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,320
to help the plant absorb it better.

[Music]

97
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,560
Potato sprouts also contain phosphorus,

98
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,520
an important nutrient that promotes root

99
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:44,199
development and plays an essential role

100
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,199
in the plant's overall growth process.

[Music]

102
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,280
Potato sprouts are also rich in calcium,

103
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,000
an essential nutrient for plant cell

104
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:01,800
development, helping to form strong and

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,800
stable cell structures.

106
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,919
At the same time, calcium also improves

107
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,760
soil pH and increases the plant's

108
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,240
ability to absorb other nutrients.

[Music]

110
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,800
Potato sprouts also contain magnesium,

111
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,560
an important nutrient that helps balance

112
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,990
pH levels and enhances the plant's

113
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,680
ability to absorb nutrients.

115
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,639
Um, you can apply the misting method on

116
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,880
the leaves or water directly at the base

117
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:38,600
once a month to provide the plant with a

118
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,600
steady supply of nutrients.

119
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,280
After more than a month, the orchid

120
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,919
spikes that had once faded have started

121
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,919
uh blooming again.

122
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,680
As you can see, the nodes with dormant

123
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,599
eyes have now developed into new flower

124
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,560
spikes, preparing for the next blooming

125
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:16,920

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,760
When you buy an orchid or someone gives

166
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,760
it to you,

167
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,480
you need to do the following.

[Music]

169
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,890
First, you need to remove the packaging

170
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,040
from the orchid.

172
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,440
Next, leave the orchid in a cool place

173
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,839
for a few hours to allow it to adjust to

174
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,839

00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,680
Uh if the growing medium is moss or

177
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:03,800
small wood chips, it is only suitable

178
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,800

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,760
leaves were also infected with black

193
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,760
mold.

194
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,160
In addition to the English dub, we've

195
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,880
now created dubs in French, German,

196
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,200
Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese,

197
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,740
Hindi, and Indonesian to help you hear

200
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,760
Therefore, you need to remove all moss

201
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,760
or old growing medium.

202
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,880
Um because this type of substrate is

203
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,800
only suitable for industrial orchid

204
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,920
gardens that can control special

205
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:49,839
humidity.

212
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:30,459

217
00:13:20,639 --> 00:14:01,760
Then you take one aloe vera leaf.

219
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:16,070

223
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:45,100
Put all the aloe vera and garlic in a

224
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:52,779
jar and soak it with 2 L of water.

227
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,680
Wait 30 minutes for the nutrients from

228
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,010
the garlic and aloe vera to dissolve

229
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:15,839
into the water.

233
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,680
Soak the roots in this solution for 30

[Music]

236
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,360
Garlic and aloe vera help stimulate root

237
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:03,160
growth and effectively fight harmful

238
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,160
insects and fungi.

240
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,759
Um, spraying this solution on the entire

241
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,440
orchid will help repel insects,

242
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,640
eliminate fungal diseases, and keep the

243
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,529
leaves green.

246
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,480
Then clean the black mold stains with

247
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,480
this solution.

00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:09,629
[Music]

249
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,730
This helps prevent orchids from

00:17:11,439 --> 00:18:03,760
recurring mold.

251
00:17:12,730 --> 00:18:05,919
[Music]

252
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,170
Now I recycle used plastic containers to

253
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:51,760
make orchid pots.

255
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,880
I put a layer of pummus on the bottom of

256
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,880
the orchid pot.

258
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,840
This helps keep the bottom of the orchid

259
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,000
pot clear so the roots don't get water

260
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:15,679

[Music]

262
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:21,110
For the top, I use dried pine bark as a

263
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:24,510
growing medium

264
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:24,510

265
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,799

267
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:05,720
When planting, cushion the substrate

268
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,720
tightly so that the roots do not move.

269
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:29,679
[Music]

270
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,760
Insert the flower branch into the right

271
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,310
position to help prevent the orchid from

272
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:53,680
shaking.

274
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,900
After planting, let it dry for 5 days

275
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:04,799
before watering.

Take care of your orchids with all the

279
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,000
