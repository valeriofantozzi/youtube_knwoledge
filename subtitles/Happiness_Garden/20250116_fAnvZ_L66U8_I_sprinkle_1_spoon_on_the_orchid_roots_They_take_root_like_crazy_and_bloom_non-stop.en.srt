uh to know if it's time to water orchids

54
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,400
I look at the color of the

55
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,639
roots when the Orchid Roots have a light

56
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,639
silver color it's time to water the

57
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,639
Orchid

58
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,479
if the roots are bright green you should

59
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:41,800
wait until the roots turn pale silver

60
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,800
before

61
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,600
watering if you water when the roots are

62
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:57,120
still green The Roots will easily become

63
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,120
water logged and cause root rot

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,960

00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,440
holes I water this one to two times a

70
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,720
month soak the roots in the this water

71
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,880
for about 20 minutes to help the roots

72
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,880

spray the entire Orchid from leaves to

Roots but you should not water the

87
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:31,240

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,240
fall off

89
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,160
do it one to two times a

95
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:22,960

if you don't have access to spraying

104
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:36,959
