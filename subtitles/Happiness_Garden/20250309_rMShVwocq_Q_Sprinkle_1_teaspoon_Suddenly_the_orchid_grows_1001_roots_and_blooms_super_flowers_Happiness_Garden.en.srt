Welcome to my

11
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,160
Because the roots do not rot, I keep the

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,000

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,840
Now you need to soak the entire orchid

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,840
in water at room temperature for 1 hour.

31
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,080

33
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:13,080

52
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,630

53
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:42,500

55
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,300
