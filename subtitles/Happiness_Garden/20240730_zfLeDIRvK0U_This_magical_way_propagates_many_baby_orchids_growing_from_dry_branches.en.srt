00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:05,633 --> 00:00:15,897
When the orchid has just lost all its flowers, it is the best time to propagate from the flower stem.

3
00:00:16,797 --> 00:00:25,895
Buttons that have bloomed cannot be propagated.

4
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:35,000
So I cut off the nodes that have finished blooming.

5
00:00:52,024 --> 00:01:02,888
Repair the cut to avoid crushing the flower stem.

6
00:01:33,015 --> 00:01:43,880
Sprinkle cinnamon powder on the cut to help it heal quickly and prevent rot

7
00:01:48,446 --> 00:01:56,877
Leave for 1 day for the cut to dry completely.

8
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:08,875
1 Day Later.

9
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:22,872
Peel off the protective film on the flower button.

10
00:02:26,005 --> 00:02:36,869
This helps baby orchids easily germinate.

11
00:03:00,032 --> 00:03:10,896
Now I use tomatoes to revive baby orchids from flower stems.

12
00:03:13,029 --> 00:03:23,893
Tomatoes contain many important nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K),

13
00:03:23,893 --> 00:03:33,891
are essential factors to promote the growth of orchids.

14
00:04:09,884 --> 00:04:19,882
Then you tie the tomato core to this position to awaken the baby orchid sprouts to revive.

15
00:04:26,014 --> 00:04:36,879
This helps baby orchids quickly revive from flower stalks.

16
00:05:16,005 --> 00:05:26,869
Leave for about 30 minutes for the nutrients to penetrate into the flower stem.

17
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:46,898
After 30 minutes, remove it.

18
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:08,894
then dry.

19
00:06:21,025 --> 00:06:31,890
Then insert the flower stem into the sponge.

20
00:06:32,323 --> 00:06:38,888
Place in a transparent jar.

21
00:06:40,021 --> 00:06:50,886
And pour a little water to always have the right humidity for the baby orchids to revive.

22
00:06:55,018 --> 00:07:06,883
Cover with transparent plastic and keep in a cool place.

23
00:07:18,014 --> 00:07:23,879
3 Weeks Later.

24
00:07:29,012 --> 00:07:38,876
The flower stem has begun to revive the baby orchid.

25
00:08:03,871 --> 00:08:13,869
Continue to place in the vase and place in a cool place for the baby orchids to grow.

26
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,899
After the next 1 month.

27
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:50,895
Baby orchids have formed from flower stems.

28
00:08:55,058 --> 00:09:03,893
Baby orchids also take root at the same time.

29
00:09:08,892 --> 00:09:18,890
Both the small orchid and its roots are healthy.

30
00:09:26,888 --> 00:09:36,886
Continue to place in the vase and place in a cool place for the baby orchids to grow.

31
00:09:49,017 --> 00:09:53,883
After the next 2 months.

32
00:10:04,881 --> 00:10:13,879
This simple method helps baby orchids grow very healthily.

33
00:11:20,042 --> 00:11:30,897
Now plant them in pots so they can grow outside.

34
00:11:42,195 --> 00:11:50,893
