00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,880
Welcome to the happiness garden, where

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,319
each day we come together to care for

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,319
and nurture the gentle beauty of

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,319
orchids.

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,840
In today's video, I will share with you

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,679
the best time to repot your orchid along

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,960
with the correct technique to help your

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:22,960
plant avoid diseases, grow strong, and

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,800
bloom beautifully all year round.

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,000
This is an orchid that needs to be

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,400
repotted as the roots inside have grown

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,559
too much and completely filled the space

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,640
while the aerial roots outside keep

14
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,079
growing longer.

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,079
This shows that the plant is searching

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,800
for a more spacious and airy environment

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:44,600
to continue growing well and prepare for

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,600
a new blooming season.

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,160
First, we need to check the potting

20
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,760
medium to see whether it is still airy

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,360
and clean or if it's time to replace it.

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,719
This is an important step that helps

23
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,280
your orchid live in the best

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:05,399
environment, reduces fungal issues, and

25
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,399
supports stronger root growth.

26
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,880
From a quick inspection, I found that

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,439
the potting medium is still fairly airy

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,560
and clean. So, I only need to remove

29
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,799
half of the old medium. This method

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,799
helps retain beneficial microorganisms

31
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,560
for the plant while creating space to

32
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,600
add new medium, allowing the roots to

33
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,600
continue growing even stronger.

34
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,159
Next, I will cut off the damaged roots

35
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,640
and trim some of the old ones. This

36
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,200
helps remove the weak parts, encourages

37
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,680
new healthy roots to grow, and allows

38
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,320
the plant to adapt better when placed in

39
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,320
the new potting medium.

40
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,720
Um, please comment and let me know which

41
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,319
country you're watching from. It's

42
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,760
wonderful that we can connect and chat

43
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,760
with each other from all around the

44
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,760
world.

45
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,680
After that, I gently remove the damaged

46
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,680
yellow and old leaves. Cleaning away the

47
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,280
unhealthy foliage helps the plant focus

48
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,120
its energy on growing roots and

49
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,480
producing new leaves, keeping your

50
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,480
orchid tidy and full of vitality.

51
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,760
Finally, I will cut off the old flower

52
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,640
spike so the plant no longer wastes

53
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,159
energy on the dried part. When removed

54
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,560
at the right time, the orchid can

55
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:30,920
recover more easily and prepare for

56
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,920
beautiful new blooms in the future.

growing tips. It's wonderful to have you

61
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,959
along on this journey.

62
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,959
Before

63
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,760
replanting, I will prepare a bit of

64
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,600
natural fertilizer to care for the plant

65
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,239
and help it recover after the trimming

66
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,239
process.

67
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,759
I add one spoon of coffee grounds into a

68
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,360
clean bottle. This simple ingredient

69
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,120
provides gentle minerals that help

70
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,919
stimulate root recovery and boost the

71
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,639
orchid's vitality before is replanted

72
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,639
into a new pot.

73
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,800
Next, I prepare 500 ml of boiled water

74
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,320
to mix with the coffee grounds. The hot

75
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,479
water helps extract the natural

76
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,720
nutrients from the coffee, creating a

77
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,479
gentle yet mineral-rich mixture that is

78
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,720
very beneficial for caring for the roots

79
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,720
after trimming.

80
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,199
After that, I close the lid and wait

81
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,720
until the water cools completely. When

82
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,400
the mixture is allowed to rest like

83
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,720
this, the nutrients in the coffee

84
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,479
dissolve more evenly, creating a gentle

85
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,360
and safe solution for caring for

86
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,360
orchids.

87
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,240
After the water has cooled, I stir the

88
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,360
mixture well so the nutrients in the

89
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,360
coffee grounds can dissolve evenly.

90
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,680
[Music]

91
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,039
Next, I strain out the residue to obtain

92
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,759
a clear solution, making the root care

93
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,840
process safer and more effective. When

94
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,840
there is no sediment left, the roots can

95
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,120
absorb nutrients more easily without the

96
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,120
risk of suffocation or damage.

97
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,639
After that, I add 1.5 L of water to make

98
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,800
a total of 2 L of liquid fertilizer.

99
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,960
This ratio keeps the mixture gentle and

100
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,479
safe, providing enough nutrients without

101
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,680
causing the orchid's roots to become

102
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,680
stressed after trimming.

103
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,400
Step one, I pour this mixture into the

104
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,800
pot to soak the roots and the remaining

105
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,800
potting medium.

106
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,600
This gentle soaking allows the roots to

107
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,039
absorb natural nutrients while also

108
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,960
cleaning and softening the potting

109
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,639
medium, creating ideal conditions for

110
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,639
the orchid to recover before being

111
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,639
replanted.

112
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,280
Soaking for about 20 minutes allows the

113
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:24,319
roots to slowly absorb nutrients while

114
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,800
soothing the freshly trimmed areas. This

115
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,120
also helps the roots become softer,

116
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:33,240
making it easier for the plant to adapt

117
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,240
when placed into the new pot.

118
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,800
Step two, use a soft cloth soaked in

119
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,919
this mixture. Then gently wipe both the

120
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,919
top and underside of the leaves.

121
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:56,639
[Music]

122
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,199
This method helps clean dust, enhances

123
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,199
the leaves natural shine, and supports

124
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:05,479
better nutrient absorption, keeping the

125
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,479
orchid healthy from root to tip.

126
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,560
When you wipe the leaves with the

127
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,280
diluted coffee solution, the dust on the

128
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,759
surface is gently removed. The leaves

129
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,599
become cleaner and more breathable,

130
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,080
helping the orchid photosynthesize more

131
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:23,639
easily and absorb light more effectively

132
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,639
during its growth.

133
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,039
The diluted coffee solution helps the

134
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,560
orchid leaves become shiny and healthy

135
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:36,560
without leaving any grease or residue.

136
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,240
This natural shine not only makes the

137
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,399
plant look more vibrant, but also

138
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,399
reflects the overall good health of the

139
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,399
orchid.

140
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,200
The natural nutrients in coffee help

141
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,160
reduce the growth of some mild fungal

142
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,920
issues on the leaves. When wiped

143
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,160
regularly, the leaves are better

144
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:00,200
protected and maintain their fresh green

145
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,200
color for a longer time.

146
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,839
When the leaf surface is clean, clear,

147
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,600
and free of dust, the orchid can the

148
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,480
orchid can absorb nutrients from the

149
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,240
care solution more easily. This helps

150
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,240
the leaves stay strong and thick,

151
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,240
supporting balanced growth from roots to

152
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,240
tip.

153
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:26,080
Step three, I pour the filtered solution

154
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,519
into a clean spray bottle. Using a spray

155
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,760
bottle helps distribute the mixture

156
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,519
evenly and gently over the entire plant,

157
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,120
ensuring both the leaves and roots

158
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,120
receive nutrients naturally and

159
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,120
effectively.

160
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,630
[Music]

161
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,000
When you spray the diluted coffee

162
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,399
mixture over the entire plant, the fine

163
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,360
mist helps remove any remaining dust

164
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:58,000
that wiping alone cannot completely

165
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,760
clean. As a result, the leaves become

166
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,080
clearer and more breathable, allowing

167
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,800
the plant to absorb light more easily

168
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,800
for effective photosynthesis.

169

[Music]

170
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,279
The natural minerals in coffee are

171
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,240
absorbed directly through the leaves

172
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,760
when you spray evenly over the surface.

173
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,519
This is a very gentle source of

174
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,160
nutrition, helping the leaves become

175
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:28,279
stronger, more vibrant, and boosting the

176
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,279
plant's resilience during growth.

177
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,050
[Music]

178
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,760
The fine mist from the spray bottle

179
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,200
helps maintain moderate humidity,

180
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,440
preventing the leaves from drying out

181
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,839
and the roots from losing moisture after

182
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:48,279
trimming. This allows the orchid to feel

183
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,279
comfortable and recover quickly.

184
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,279
After soaking for about 20 minutes,

185
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,600
gently take the orchid out to let the

186
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:02,320
potting medium drain. This helps remove

187
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,640
excess solution, prevents root rot, and

188
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,200
prepares the plant to adapt well when

189
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,239
replanted into a new pot.

[Music]

191
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,760
Next, soak the remaining potting medium

192
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,680
to disinfect it and add extra nutrients,

193
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,839
making use of the same diluted coffee

194
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,839
solution that was used for soaking the

195
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,839
orchid.

196
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,720
This method helps the potting medium

197
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,399
stay clean and rich in minerals,

198
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,800
creating a favorable environment for the

199
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:50,440
orchid roots to anchor firmly and grow

200
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,440
strong when replanted.

201
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,959
Soaking the potting medium for about 20

202
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,680
minutes allows the nutrients from the

203
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,600
coffee solution to penetrate evenly

204
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,079
while also eliminating any remaining

205
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,160
harmful microorganisms.

206
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,320
This is an important step to create a

207
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,880
clean, nutrient-rich foundation, helping

208
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,440
the orchid roots anchor firmly and grow

209
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,440
strong when replanted.

210
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,760
After soaking, remove the potting medium

211
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,079
and let it drain completely before

212
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,000
planting the orchid. This prevents root

213
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,079
rot and ensures the plant is placed into

214
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,160
a medium that is both clean and

215
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:41,160
nutrient-rich, ready for healthy growth.

216
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,959
When you check and find that the potting

217
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,880
medium no longer sticks to your hands

218
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,040
and maintains a moderately loose

219
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,920
texture, it means it is ready for

220
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,079
planting. In this state, the medium

221
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,160
helps the orchid roots anchor firmly,

222
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,160
provides good irration, and allows

223
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:12,600
efficient nutrient absorption, creating

224
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,600
optimal conditions for healthy growth.

225
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:18,880
First, place some large pine bark at the

226
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,959
bottom of the pot. This layer ensures

227
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,040
good drainage, prevents the orchid roots

228
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,200
from becoming water logged, and provides

229
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,200
the necessary erration for healthy root

230
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,200
growth.

231
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,000
Next, place the orchid into the pot and

232
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,399
fill small potting medium around the

233
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
roots. This helps stabilize the plant

234
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:46,440
while ensuring the roots have good

235
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,440
contact with the nutrient-rich medium.

236
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,870
[Applause]

237
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,160
After planting, place the orchid pot in

238
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,560
a cool, airy spot for about a week and

239
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,199
do not water it. This period allows the

240
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,120
roots to adapt to the new medium,

241
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,959
reduces the risk of shock or root rot,

242
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,199
and prepares the plant to recover and

243
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,199
grow vigorously.

244
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,639
After a week without watering, you can

245
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,720
start providing nutrients to the orchid

246
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,519
by watering with the diluted coffee

247
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,680
solution or other natural fertilizers at

248
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,680
a frequency of two to three times per

249
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,680
month.

250
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,639
This helps the plant gradually absorb

251
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,880
the necessary minerals, nourish the

252
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,440
roots and leaves, and prepare for

253
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:22,549
vibrant blooms in the future.

254
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,549
[Music]

255
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,320
This helps the plant gradually absorb

256
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,000
the necessary minerals, nourish the

257
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,120
roots and leaves, and prepare for

258
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,120
vibrant blooms in the future.

259
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,079
Place the orchid pot in a cool, airy

260
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,279
spot with gentle sunlight. This soft

261
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,120
light allows the plant to

262
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,279
photosynthesize effectively without

263
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,279
scorching the leaves while maintaining

264
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:55,560
an ideal environment for healthy root

265
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,560
and leaf growth after replanting.

266
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,240
And here are the results 3 weeks after

267
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,240
repotting. You can see that the orchid

268
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,839
leaves have become glossy and firm,

269
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,320
showing that the plant has recovered

270
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,920
well, absorbed nutrients effectively,

271
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,920
and is ready for the next vibrant

272
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,920
blooms.

273
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,160
You can see that even the older leaves

274
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,759
have become glossy and healthy. This

275
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,839
shows that the natural care and

276
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,000
nutrition method we applied is working

277
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:44,120
effectively, helping the orchid recover

278
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,120
fully from roots to leaves.

279
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,409
[Music]

280
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:57,759
[Music]

281
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,920
Additionally, the orchid roots are

282
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,399
firmly anchored in the potting medium

283
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,600
while the aerial roots are also growing

284
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:08,160
long and strong. This is a clear sign

285
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,160
that the plant is developing in balance,

286
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:14,439
ready to nourish its leaves and prepare

287
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,439
for the upcoming vibrant blooms.

288
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,120
Especially the dormant buds on the old

289
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,679
flower spike have begun to sprout,

290
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,439
forming new flower buds. This is a

291
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,760
wonderful sign that the orchid is not

292
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,919
only recovering but also preparing for

293
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:34,200
the next blooming cycle, promising

294
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,200
vibrant flowers in the future.

295
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,799
As long as you follow the steps shown in

296
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,840

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:50,520
strong roots, and ready for vibrant

299
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,520
blooms in the upcoming seasons.

300
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,919
And over time, with regular care and

301
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,240
patience, your garden will gradually be

302
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,880
filled with the colors of vibrant orchid

303
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,360
blooms. Each pot thriving and growing
