00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,151
Welcome to Happiness Garden channel

2
00:00:03,151 --> 00:00:09,865
In this video, I share how to grow it to grow fast

3
00:00:10,935 --> 00:00:15,931
When I just bought orchids,

4
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:21,130
We remove all this moss,

5
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:28,128
Because these orchid pots are grown in an industrial environment,

6
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:36,127
controlled by temperature, humidity, and light Ideal for orchids.

7
00:00:36,128 --> 00:00:43,718
but when brought back, the environment has been changed, making these roots easy to rot

8
00:00:44,893 --> 00:00:51,309
You should cut off the damaged roots.

9
00:00:52,130 --> 00:01:00,075
Then wash the roots.

10
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:10,303
Use used plastic bottles

11
00:01:11,286 --> 00:01:19,052
I recycle to grow semi-hydroponic orchids

12
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:26,650
This way of growing will not need watering

13
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:34,721
but still help the orchid grow very strong,

14
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:45,725
the flowers are more beautiful and brilliant, invite you to watch.

15
00:02:19,582 --> 00:02:30,308
I need to wash the plastic bottle to make sure it's clean from fungi,

16
00:02:30,308 --> 00:02:39,636
and bacteria that are harmful to the orchid.

17
00:03:16,337 --> 00:03:28,574
Using the drill bit will cut out the positions here

18
00:03:49,634 --> 00:03:56,854
This part will be used as an orchid pot

19
00:03:56,854 --> 00:04:04,123
The rest is for water storage

20
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:16,067
Using a glass jar on the bottom will help the roots not absorb too much water.

21
00:04:31,859 --> 00:04:36,208
Put the orchid in

22
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:46,110
 Put terracotta seeds around the pot

23
00:04:46,898 --> 00:04:55,109
grown in a semi-hydroponic environment, often in contact with water

24
00:04:55,109 --> 00:05:02,983
so we use breathable terracotta beads is the best

25
00:05:03,974 --> 00:05:10,813
If it's breathable, it's very rarely rotten

26
00:05:11,735 --> 00:05:18,769
And after planting, the roots will grow very fast

27
00:05:20,713 --> 00:05:27,412
I finished planting

28
00:05:33,621 --> 00:05:38,642
you water the potted plants,

29
00:05:38,642 --> 00:05:46,560
We only water once, next time you don't need to water anymore

30
00:05:47,532 --> 00:05:55,153
With this simple planting method, you save a lot of time to take care of

31
00:05:56,804 --> 00:06:06,859
With this planting method, you will let the water level cover part of the bottom of the pot

32
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:15,126
The water will absorb itself, helping to maintain the moisture in the growing medium,

33
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:20,525
 we will not need to water anymore.

34
00:06:20,525 --> 00:06:29,700
When the water in the container is empty, remember to add more water to keep the growing medium in a moist state

35
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:39,194
This is an orchid, I planted it according to this method, it is growing very fast now

36
00:06:39,194 --> 00:06:49,626
The flowers are long-lasting and have many branches on the same branch.

37
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:02,452
This orchid I grow semi-hydroponic with pine bark

38
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:12,498
Flowers bloom brilliantly, boldly, and last longer

39
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:24,371
growing semi-hydroponic orchids, the moisture is always well maintained,

40
00:07:24,371 --> 00:07:29,759
the roots will grow very quickly

41
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:37,534
It will help plants perform metabolism, absorb organic fertilizer and water very well.

42
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:48,208
 With this simple planting method, we will get orchids that grow faster.

43
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:54,773
Hope the video will help you a lot.

44
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:15,869
Next, I share how to help restore this wilted orchid.

45
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:56,894
First you need to cut off the damaged roots

46
00:09:08,892 --> 00:09:27,888
Next, apply the candle to the spot you just cut so that the water does not seep into the body of the orchid.

47
00:09:38,886 --> 00:09:45,884
Take filtered water at room temperature

48
00:09:45,884 --> 00:09:56,882
Add coconut fiber to keep moisture

49
00:10:03,881 --> 00:10:41,873
Apply the gel of the onion to the stem of the orchid to stimulate growth

50
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:35,896
Keep in a place with daylight and do not place in direct sunlight because sunlight will cause orchids to rot.

51
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:51,893
AFTER 2 WEEKS

52
00:11:57,892 --> 00:12:10,889
The orchid stem is fresh again and grows a small sprout

53
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:42,883
AFTER 2 MONTHS

54
00:14:38,308 --> 00:14:45,292
This is an old and wilted phalaenopsis orchid

55
00:14:45,292 --> 00:14:51,291
Don't rush to throw it away

56
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:58,289
I will share tips to help it recover quickly

57
00:15:43,852 --> 00:16:03,843
I use aloe vera to revive it

58
00:16:03,843 --> 00:16:10,342
There are many gels in aloe vera leaves

59
00:16:10,342 --> 00:16:22,339
Aloe vera gel contains a lot of nutrients, vitamins and minerals to help plants revive quickly

60
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:22,894
I pour water at room temperature to wet the orchid growing medium

61
00:17:33,892 --> 00:17:45,889
Fill this tray with water so that the steam rises to help the medium and the environment in the orchid growing area stay moist

62
00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:53,888
To tree lan into

63
00:17:55,887 --> 00:18:10,884
cover back. Keep in a place with soft light. Be careful not to expose to direct sunlight.

64
00:18:10,884 --> 00:18:20,882
After 1 week I will open it. You will be very surprised to see

65
00:18:40,878 --> 00:18:50,877

00:19:08,873 --> 00:19:16,871
Next, I share how to propagate orchids from old, withered branches

67
00:19:16,871 --> 00:19:28,869
This is a vegetable glue. It prevents water 

68
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:39,900
This is a vegetable glue. It prevents water from seeping inside

69
00:19:49,898 --> 00:20:00,896
You can also replace this glue by burning a candle and putting it on to prevent it from getting waterproof

70
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:39,888
Scrape off the outer membrane so that the sprouts are easy to germinate.

71
00:21:38,877 --> 00:21:48,875
You use 1 clove of garlic

72
00:21:58,873 --> 00:22:08,871
Apply garlic juice to newly shaved areas to wake up the sprout

73
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:43,897
I use a type of moss

74
00:22:43,897 --> 00:22:55,895
Fill with water and check the humidity

75
00:23:05,893 --> 00:23:12,891
Put the orchid branch in

76
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:20,890
Cover up

77
00:23:23,889 --> 00:23:30,888
Keep in a place with daylight. You must not leave it in direct sunlight

78
00:23:32,887 --> 00:23:42,885
after 1 month

79
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:13,867
Next, I share how to propagate and stimulate rooting for orchids easily.

80
00:25:45,894 --> 00:26:02,891
Blot the cut dry

81
00:26:02,891 --> 00:26:22,887
Light a candle and apply it on the cut so the water doesn't get in.

82
00:26:47,882 --> 00:26:54,881
That way the orchid will not rot.

83
00:27:50,870 --> 00:28:00,868
Take 1 small piece of ginger

84
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:22,873
Store in a place with daylight and take care not to expose to direct sunlight.

85
00:30:26,872 --> 00:30:41,869
After 3 weeks

86
00:31:35,892 --> 00:31:42,890
after 3 months

87
00:32:50,110 --> 00:33:00,108
Next, I share how to help wilted orchids quickly produce new flowers

88
00:33:00,108 --> 00:33:10,006
These are withered branches. I helped it grow many new branches quickly.

89
00:33:32,646 --> 00:33:39,634
My secret is to use a potato.

90
00:33:39,634 --> 00:33:47,632
Choosing germinated potatoes will be very good

91
00:33:47,632 --> 00:33:55,131
Potato sprouts are very good growth stimulants for plants

92
00:33:58,281 --> 00:34:06,262
Use 10 grams of potatoes

93
00:34:09,835 --> 00:34:18,826
Add 500ml room temperature water and puree

94
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:54,919
Cut off the top because there are no sprouts

95
00:34:54,919 --> 00:35:02,345
Let the cut dry naturally

96
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:16,748
Peel off the outer dry film so that the sprouts can grow easily

97
00:36:09,995 --> 00:36:19,969
Dip a sponge in the potato water you just made and place it where the sprouts are

98
00:36:28,183 --> 00:36:38,165
Repeat this once a week to allow the potato juice to penetrate and stimulate germination

99
00:37:05,975 --> 00:37:17,957
On normal days, you just need to mist to keep moisture

100
00:37:40,393 --> 00:38:00,382
Wait 2-3 weeks, new flower sprouts like this

101
00:38:10,447 --> 00:38:20,445
