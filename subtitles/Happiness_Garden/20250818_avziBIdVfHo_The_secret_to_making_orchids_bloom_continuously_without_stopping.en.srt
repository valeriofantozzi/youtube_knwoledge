00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,240
Hello everyone. Today we will explore

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,480
the secrets of caring for orchids so

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,720
that they stay healthy and can bloom all

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,360
year round. When you understand the

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,679
plant's needs from light, water to

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,160
nutrients, orchids will not only live

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,480
well, but also bring you continuous

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,720
beautiful flowers. With patience and

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,960
love for the plant, you will see your

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:27,240
home always filled with the colors and

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,240
fragrance of radiant orchids.

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,559
To make natural fertilizer, I choose a

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,020
fresh okra and cut it into very thin

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:44,480
slices.

[Music]

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,160
Uh in this way, the nutrients in okra

17
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,320
will dissolve more easily, helping the

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,360
orchid absorb them quickly and grow

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,360
strong from roots to leaves.

growing tips. It's wonderful to have you

25
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,799
along for the journey.

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:16,119
After cutting the okra into thin slices,

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,119
I put them all into a clean jar.

28
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,439
Uh, the next ingredient is rice. I take

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,880
two teaspoons of rice and put it

30
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,880
together with the okra.

31
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,159
Then I put all the ingredients into

32
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,840
about one liter of warm water. Warm

33
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,240
water will help extract the nutrients

34
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,159
from okra and rice faster, creating a

35
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,840
nutrient-rich solution that easily

36
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,400
penetrates the orchid roots and

37
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,439
nourishes the plant to grow vigorously.

[Music]

39
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,479
Then I stir the mixture well, close the

40
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,240
lid tightly, and leave it overnight.

41
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,000
During this time, the nutrients from

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,240
okra and rice will be fully released

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,240
into the water, creating a natural,

44
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,479
safe, and highly beneficial fertilizer

45
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,479
for orchids.

46
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,560
After buying orchids from industrial

47
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,200
gardens, you will see that the flowers

48
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,280
only bloom beautifully for a short time,

49
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,440
then gradually wither and quickly fall

50
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,520
off. If you don't know how to care for

51
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,239
them properly, the orchid will become

52
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,880
weak, easily die, and will never bloom

53
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:24,800
again.

[Music]

55
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,520
You can see on this stem many flowers

56
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,360
have already fallen. If we don't take

57
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,680
proper care, the remaining flowers will

58
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,879
also quickly wither and fall off,

59
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,879
leaving the orchid stem bare.

61
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,440
To keep the remaining flowers on the

62
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,879
stem blooming longer, the first thing

63
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,519
you should do is remove the old pot and

64
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,519
move the plant into a new one. This way,

65
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,200
the orchid roots will have a clean, airy

66
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,760
environment and can absorb nutrients

67
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:14,139
more easily.

After that, cut off the yellowed or

71
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,560
damaged leaves. This helps the plant

72
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,480
avoid wasting energy on weak parts and

73
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,680
at the same time allows the healthy

74
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,680
roots and leaves to grow better.

76
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,640
Next, cut off the rotten or shriveled

77
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,400
roots. By removing the weak roots, the

78
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,640
plant will focus its energy on

79
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,080
nourishing the healthy ones, thereby

80
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,920
providing enough nutrients for the

81
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,040
remaining flowers and helping them stay

82
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,040
fresh longer on the stem.

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,239
place for fungi, bacteria, and many

86
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,920
other pathogens. Cutting them off will

87
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,680
help prevent the spread to the healthy

88
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:24,740

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,840
rot can easily spread to these new

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,840
roots.

95
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,520
New roots will have a better ability to

96
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:55,840
absorb water and nutrients, thereby

97
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,840
helping the orchid grow stronger.

103
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,160
Uh damaged roots will reduce the plant's

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,320
ability to absorb water and nutrients.

105
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,160
By removing them, the orchid will more

106
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,080
easily take in the essential nutrients

107
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,120
from the environment, helping it stay

When roots are rotten or damaged, they

111
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,520
can hinder air circulation in the

112
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,759
growing medium. Removing the damaged

113
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,919
roots helps improve irerration for the

114
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,820

115
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:12,790

After that, cut off all the dried or

119
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,600
damaged stems. This helps the plant

120
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,000
avoid wasting energy on dead parts and

121
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:42,199

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,199
healthy shoots and stems.

123
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,479
Now I plant the orchid into a new pot.

124
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,720
This time adding some crushed pine bark.

125
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,520
Pine bark not only keeps the roots well

126
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,520
airrated but also ensures good drainage

127
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,360
creating an ideal environment for the

128
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,310
plant to grow healthily and bloom

129
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,449

133
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,960
usually need a new environment to

134
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,800
continue growing. Um, transplanting into

135
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,560
a new pot with fresh nutrient-rich

136
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,360

137
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,599
the roots and the entire plant, helping

138
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,080

139
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,080

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,319
For the other plant, I planted into a

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,840
smaller pot just the right size for the

144
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,759

Choosing a suitable pot helps the roots

146
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:49,039
grow evenly, keeps the plant healthy,

147
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,039
and makes it easier to absorb water and

148
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,039
nutrients.

[Music]

150
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,639
Um, when the plant is replanted, the

151
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,800
roots will have new space and nutrients

152
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,879
to grow. This helps the plant absorb

153
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,160
water and nutrients more efficiently,

154
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,919
promoting its growth.

155
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,160
After being planted in a new pot and

156
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,720
properly cared for, the orchid will grow

157
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,599
more vigorously and have the potential

158
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,639

159
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,319
in the following seasons.

160
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,879
After planting, let the plant sit

161
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,720
overnight without watering immediately.

162
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,479
This helps the roots stabilize in the

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:35,640
new environment and prevents them from

164
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,640
rotting due to excess moisture too soon.

165
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,399
After fermenting overnight, we stir well

166
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,440
so that the nutrients from the flowers

167
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,440
fully dissolve in the water.

169
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,320
Then strain out the remaining residue in

170
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,720
the solution. This step helps make the

171

fertilizer solution clear and clean,

172
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,320
allowing it to penetrate the orchid

173
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,600
roots easily and ensure the plant

174
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,600
absorbs nutrients more effectively.

175
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,680
Next, dilute the solution by adding one

176
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,000
more liter of water. Diluting helps make

177
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,080
the solution sufficiently nutritious,

178
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
safe for the roots, and easily absorbed

179
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,720
by the plant without causing irritation

180
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,720

181
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,920
Step one, use a cotton pad to soak a

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,760
plant clean and healthy.

187
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,680

188
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,279
mineral deposits on the leaves, keeping

provides the necessary energy for the

250
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,720
remaining flowers on the stem. As a

251
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,800
result, the flowers last longer on the

252
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,279

253
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:59,320

the roots to absorb the maximum

259
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,760

260
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,770

over the entire orchid, including the

266
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,720
leaves and stem. This helps the plant

267
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,480
absorb nutrients from the leaf surface

268
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,600
while keeping the leaves and flowers

269
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,760
fresh and healthy.

270
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,800
This method works similarly to using

271
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,720
folure fertilizer. It provides the plant

272
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,480
with easily absorbable nutrients,

273
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,560
helping the leaves and flowers take them

274
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,800
up quickly, nourishing the plant and

275
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,720
keeping the flowers fresh for longer.

276
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,720
This lightly fermented mixture will

277
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,040
comprehensively protect and nourish the

278
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,600
orchid, helping the plant grow strong

279
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,600
from roots through the stem to the

280
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,600
leaves.

281
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,480
After soaking for 20 minutes, take the

282
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,959
orchid pot out and place it in a spot

283
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,320
with gentle light. This helps the plant

284
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:30,399
photosynthesize effectively. Remember,

285
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,920
no matter how good the fertilizer is, if

286
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,760
the plant lacks light, it will be

287
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,110
difficult for it to grow vigorously and

288
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:48,560
bloom beautifully.
