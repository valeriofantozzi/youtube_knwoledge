00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome to my channel

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,998
Today I would like to introduce to you a video on how to use tobacco to irrigate orchids

3
00:00:10,998 --> 00:00:18,497
Helps repel insects and protect orchids from thriving.

4
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:26,862
We use 1 cigarette

5
00:00:54,437 --> 00:01:04,421
Soak tobacco with 1 liter of water at room temperature

6
00:01:04,421 --> 00:01:15,807
then incubated for 1 day

7
00:01:23,552 --> 00:01:27,244
1 DAY AFTER

8
00:01:36,023 --> 00:01:41,734
Filter out residue

9
00:01:49,334 --> 00:01:55,334
Use a cotton ball to soak up tobacco water

10
00:01:55,334 --> 00:02:05,915
Then wipe the top and bottom of the leaves thoroughly

11
00:02:05,915 --> 00:02:18,231
This helps to protect the orchid leaves from insects and fungi extremely effectively

12
00:02:18,231 --> 00:02:26,272
just do this 1-2 times per month

13
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:37,970
If you wipe regularly, the orchid leaves will be green like this

14
00:02:46,697 --> 00:02:56,500
Next, you use tobacco water to irrigate the root

15
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:06,122
do this 1-2 times a month

16
00:03:06,122 --> 00:03:16,961
The ingredients in tobacco reduce the ability of harmful insects

17
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:27,852
like scorpions, aphids and bugs, rod slugs damage the roots

18
00:03:33,078 --> 00:03:41,623
The rest of the tobacco juice I pour into the spray bottle

19
00:03:41,623 --> 00:03:50,555
Then spray evenly on the top, bottom and the whole root

20
00:03:50,555 --> 00:03:58,920
Can be sprayed on flowers to help protect them

21
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:06,718
Tobacco is a natural insecticide.

22
00:04:06,718 --> 00:04:14,983
Widely used in agriculture and crop care.

23
00:04:14,983 --> 00:04:22,382
This is an effective way to repel insects that are harmful to orchids.

24
00:04:22,382 --> 00:04:32,413
In addition, the ingredients in tobacco

25
00:04:32,413 --> 00:04:42,501
capable of stimulating the growth of orchids,

26
00:04:43,097 --> 00:04:49,797
The type of fertilizer that helps to stimulate the absorption of nutrients for orchids

27
00:04:51,133 --> 00:05:01,218
use 10ml of fermented milk

28
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:18,549
mix with 1 liter of water

29
00:05:32,609 --> 00:05:44,632
Then use this fermented milk water to water each orchid pot with 10 spoons

30
00:05:44,632 --> 00:05:56,964
Fermented milk contains many vitamins and minerals

31
00:05:56,964 --> 00:06:11,760
like vitamins A, B, C, D

32
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:18,326
calcium, protein

33
00:06:18,326 --> 00:06:32,335
Very essential for the growth of orchids

34
00:06:32,335 --> 00:06:42,387
In addition, fermented milk also helps beneficial microorganisms grow,

35
00:06:42,387 --> 00:06:49,401
protects the roots very well

36
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:59,951
Orchid roots will grow very well if you regularly use fermented milk to care for orchids

37
00:06:59,951 --> 00:07:09,397
Just take care of milk fermentation 1-2 times per month

38
00:07:09,397 --> 00:07:17,001
Combined with other organic fertilizers, orchids will grow extremely well

39
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,371
RESULT

40
00:07:23,404 --> 00:07:30,378
you see my orchid here

41
00:07:30,378 --> 00:07:39,335
There are many flower buds growing on the same branch

42
00:07:39,335 --> 00:07:47,841
Flowers bloom in many colors

43
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:55,735
Flowers can be kept on branches for up to 6 months before fading

44
00:08:00,342 --> 00:08:03,871
Welcome to part 2 of the video

45
00:08:03,871 --> 00:08:11,870
Today I will show you how to revive a rotten orchid like this.

46
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:22,868
When the orchid has withered all the leaves, only the stem and roots remain, do not rush to throw it away.

47
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:56,894
Here are still fresh roots.

48
00:08:56,894 --> 00:09:22,889
First, cut off all damaged, rotten roots.

49
00:09:34,887 --> 00:09:56,882
Apply a molten candle on the cut so that the water does not penetrate the tree.

50
00:10:19,878 --> 00:10:33,875
Use 2 teaspoons of cinnamon powder.

51
00:10:41,873 --> 00:11:03,869
Add 1 liter of boiled water.

52
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:18,899
Close the lid and wait for the water to cool.

53
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:31,897
The water has cooled down

54
00:11:31,897 --> 00:12:07,890
Filter out residue.

55
00:12:15,888 --> 00:12:28,886
Soak orchids in this water for 30 minutes.

56
00:12:34,884 --> 00:13:11,877
The rest of the water I will spray on other orchids to help protect the orchid from insects and fungal diseases

57
00:13:14,876 --> 00:13:25,874
After soaking for 30 minutes, plant it.

58
00:13:25,874 --> 00:13:43,871
Using pine bark and dry pumice stone to plant will help absorb moisture in the roots, making the orchid roots not rot.

59
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:49,869
Add some dry moss on the face.

60
00:13:49,869 --> 00:13:54,868
Put in a cool and well-lit place for 7 days

61
00:13:54,868 --> 00:14:06,899
After 7 days, you can spray water to keep the plants moist.

62
00:14:12,898 --> 00:14:21,896
Cover with a clear, vented plastic container and wait for the plant to revive.

63
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:30,895
AFTER 3 WEEKS,

64
00:14:30,895 --> 00:14:37,893
A sprout has sprouted,

65
00:14:37,893 --> 00:14:48,891
Spray water once every 5 days to keep the sprouts moist

66
00:14:50,891 --> 00:15:16,886
AFTER 2 MONTHS

67
00:15:16,886 --> 00:15:26,884
