00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,480
Welcome to the happiness garden where

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,919
every moment spent with the orchid pots

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,519
becomes a gentle and inspiring joy.

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,080
Today I want to share with you a video

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,240
titled Use this instead of orchid soil.

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,720
Orchids will bloom abundantly and grow

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,800
new roots. This is a simple secret but

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,199
brings surprising results helping your

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:25,920
orchids not only bloom more beautifully

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:27,599
but also grow many new vigorous roots.

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,400
If you are caring for an orchid that

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,960
still hasn't bloomed, don't worry. Um,

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,600
that can be fixed with just a few minor

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,200
adjustments in your care. Follow each

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,040
step carefully and follow the

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,360
instructions and you will see the plant

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,719
begin to grow new roots and gradually

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,960
bloom brilliantly again.

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,600
First, gently remove all the old growing

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,360
medium and cut off any damaged roots.

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,360
This is an important step to help the

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,440
orchid start fresh with a healthier root

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,440
system and prepare for its new growth

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,440
stage.

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,680
Uh you can see that the growing medium

26
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,880
has been left for too long and is

27
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:10,080
constantly wet causing the roots to rot

28
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,760
and nearly decay completely. This is the

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,720
reason the plant cannot absorb nutrients

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,720
and has difficulty blooming.

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,680
Therefore, when growing orchids, you

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,640
need to pay special attention not to

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,240
overwater and to repot at the right time

34
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,320
so the plant always has a well

35
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,450
ventilated environment and avoids root

36
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,560
rot like this.

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,280
Then you just need to rinse the entire

48
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,600
root system under running water to

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,870
remove dirt and help the plant truly

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:14,279

53
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,360
Use a small aloe leaf and cut it into

54
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,319
thin slices to prepare a natural source

55
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,959
of fertilizer. Aloe contains a lot of

56
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,360
nutrient-rich gel that helps orchids

57
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,080
recover quickly and stimulates strong

58
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,480
new root growth. Not only that, aloe

59
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,319
also has natural antiseptic properties

60
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,560
that help protect the orchid from root

61
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,120
rot and leaf rot, keeping the plant

62
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,120
clean and healthy.

63
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,239
After that, you just need to add about

64
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,840
one liter of water to dissolve the

65
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,840
nutrients from the aloe.

68
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,159
Next, add one teaspoon of honey. Uh, an

69
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,400
ingredient that not only has natural

70
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,720
antiseptic properties, but also provides

71
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:29,159
nutrients that help the orchid recover

72
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,159
faster and grow stronger.

73
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,120
Stir the mixture well and let it sit for

74
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,120
about 1 hour, allowing the nutrients to

75
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,799
fully dissolve and create a slight

76
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,239
fermentation process that makes the

77
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,239
mixture easier for the orchid to absorb.

00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:56,560
[Music]

80
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,360
After letting the mixture rest for about

81
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,920
1 hour, use a soft cloth soaked in this

82
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,080
natural fertilizer solution and gently

83
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,480
wipe both the upper and lower surfaces

84
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,560
of each leaf. This simple method helps

85
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,959
the leaves absorb nutrients faster and

86
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,959
recover better.

87
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,320
Uh this method also helps remove fungus

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and harmful bacteria, keeping the leaves

89
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,440
clean and helping the orchid stay

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,440
healthier throughout the recovery

91
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,440
process.

92
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,840
After that, soak the entire orchid in

93
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,280
this aloe and honey mixture for about 20

94
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,120
to 30 minutes. This is an important step

95
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,520
that helps the plant absorb nutrients

96
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,520
more deeply, thereby stimulating faster

97
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,230
new root growth and supporting a

98
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,360
stronger recovery process.

100
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,120
Next, I reuse a plastic bottle and turn

101
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,040
it into a no watering orchid pot. With

102
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,520
this planting method, you almost don't

103
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,440
need to water at all. Yet, the orchid

104
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,160
still retains the necessary moisture and

105
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,080
grows very healthily. This is a simple,

106
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,120
economical, and extremely effective

107
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,120

118
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,800
After preparing the recycled pot, you

119
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,880
just need to place the orchid inside and

120
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,199
use pine bark as the growing medium to

121
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,120
keep the roots well ventilated. This

122
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,440
way, the plant gets enough air to grow

123
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,680
strongly and greatly reduces the risk of

124
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,680
root rot.

[Music]

126
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,720
Finally, cover the surface of the pot

127
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,639
with a thin layer of moss. This layer

128
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,280
helps gently retain moisture for the

129
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,680
roots while still ensuring ventilation,

130
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:04,120
creating an ideal environment for the

131
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,120
orchid to recover and grow.

132
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,880
Now you just need to water a little to

133
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,800
moisten the growing medium, helping the

134
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,800
orchid begin to adapt to its new home.

135
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,400
When you create drainage holes on the

136
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,160
side of the pot like this, the water

137
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,240
level will always stay at a safe

138
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,880
position and never reach the entire root

139
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,960
system. Thanks to this, the orchid roots

140
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,120
won't become water logged and will stay

141
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,199
moderately moist.

142
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,440
With stable moisture and continuous

143
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,120
ventilation, new roots will grow

144
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,520
quickly, and the orchid will soon

145
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,520
recover strongly.

146
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,720
Place the orchid pot in a spot with

147
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,120
gentle sunlight where the plant receives

148
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,919
enough soft light without being exposed

149
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,599
to harsh direct sun.

150
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,680
This helps the leaves photosynthesize

151
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,560
better and supports faster root growth

152
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,199
and recovery.

153
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,280
And here are the results after 1 month

154
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,599

155
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,759
growing strong and full of vitality.

156
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:06,080
This shows that this simple care method

157
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,720
has helped the orchid revive and enter a

158
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,720
stronger growth phase.

159
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,440
When the roots have grown healthy like

160
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,560
this, you should start using organic

161
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,759
folure fertilizers such as rice water,

162
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,680
soy milk, honey, fish emulsion. As I

163
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,840
have shared before, apply them to the

164
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,520
orchid about once every two weeks to

165
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,199
provide enough nutrients for the plant

166
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,599
to continue growing strongly and

167
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,599
blooming regularly.

168
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,719

can see that the orchid I cared for

171
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,640
using this method has grown extremely

172

Welcome to the garden of happiness.

Drop the molten candle solution on the

bottom of the orchid leaves. Um,

250
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,240
cinnamon has antiseptic properties, so

251
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:16,480
it helps to eliminate fungi and insects

252
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:18,959
that are harmful to orchids very well.

253
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,199
Cinnamon also contains many minerals,

254
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:25,720
vitamins, and amino acids that are very

255
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,720
beneficial for the revival of orchids.

256
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,320
Do this once a month to keep your orchid

257
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:34,619

the orchid cutings and plant them.

I plant in shredded pine bark to help

263
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,399

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,399

Recycling plastic bottles into miniature

286
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,640
Since the tree has grown roots, I use

287
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,439
organic fertilizer made from fish waste

288
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,439
to fertilize the orchid.

289

The baby orchid is still very small, so

290
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,039
I only apply it on the outside edge of

291
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,240
the pot to avoid causing the baby orchid

292
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:32,369
