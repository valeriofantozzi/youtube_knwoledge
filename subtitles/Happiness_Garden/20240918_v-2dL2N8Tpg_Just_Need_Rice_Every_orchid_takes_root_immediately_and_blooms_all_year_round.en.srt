00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
Hello friends

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,899
Nice to meet you on my channel

3
00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:13,898
For orchids to grow healthily, they need strong roots.

4
00:00:13,898 --> 00:00:19,897
Thanks to that, the orchid will grow sustainably and bloom with many flowers

5
00:00:19,897 --> 00:00:26,895
In this video, I share a new type of organic fertilizer with ingredients available in every kitchen.

6
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:35,893
Cucumber products are excellent organic fertilizers for orchids

7
00:00:41,897 --> 00:00:48,891
When eating cucumbers, keep the peel to use as fertilizer

8
00:00:48,891 --> 00:00:56,889
Cucumber peel contains many nutrients such as potassium, magnesium, 

9
00:00:56,889 --> 00:01:04,888
and other vitamins, help plants grow strongly, especially stimulating the rooting and blooming process.

10
00:01:08,887 --> 00:01:16,885
Take the cucumber peel and put it in a mortar

11
00:01:22,884 --> 00:01:28,883
Next I need rice

12
00:01:28,883 --> 00:01:35,881
Take 1 spoon of rice

13
00:01:36,881 --> 00:01:43,880
500ml water

14
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:12,874
Incubate for 6 hours

15
00:02:20,873 --> 00:02:26,871
6 Hours later

16
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:39,869
puree

17
00:03:03,897 --> 00:03:10,896
Filter residue

18
00:03:29,892 --> 00:03:36,891
Add 3 liters of water

19
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:59,886
First we need to clean the leaves

20
00:04:01,886 --> 00:04:10,884
Take a cotton ball and wipe the leaves with this water

21
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:23,881
Thoroughly wipe both the top and bottom of the leaves 1-2 times a month

22
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:39,878
Helps remove dirt and residue from leaves

23
00:04:50,876 --> 00:05:00,874
This method also kills fungi and insects that reside on leaves and harm orchids.

24
00:05:24,869 --> 00:05:31,868
Carefully wipe the underside of the leaves as well.

25
00:05:32,868 --> 00:05:42,899
Because the underside of leaves is often wet, insects and fungal diseases often hide there.

26
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:52,897
They just wait for an opportunity and when they encounter favorable conditions, they will cause diseases that destroy orchids.

27
00:05:55,702 --> 00:06:03,932
This will also help keep the leaf's stomata open

28
00:06:03,932 --> 00:06:10,931
and your orchid will photosynthesize the light better

29
00:06:11,522 --> 00:06:15,711
Helps increase resistance for orchids

30
00:06:17,892 --> 00:06:20,892
Method 1

31
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:30,890
Water each orchid pot with about 10 tablespoons of this water.

32
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:40,888
This type of fertilizer helps stimulate new roots very well

33
00:06:44,887 --> 00:06:52,885
At the same time, it has the ability to keep the orchid growing environment moist.

34
00:06:56,884 --> 00:07:02,883
Helps improve absorption

35
00:07:02,883 --> 00:07:10,882
and nutrient exchange of the orchid growing environment.

36
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:18,880
This helps orchids grow stronger.

37
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:33,877
Do this regularly 1-2 times a month for sustainable orchid growth.

38
00:07:33,877 --> 00:07:42,875
Promotes better rooting, budding and photosynthesis.

39
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:55,873
Stimulates blooming and produces more beautiful flowers.

40
00:07:58,872 --> 00:08:03,871
Next, pour this water into the jar

41
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:19,868
Method 2

42
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:26,900
Now you spray the leaves and roots of the orchid.

43
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:38,898
Cucumber peel has good water retention properties, 

44
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:46,896
Helps maintain essential moisture for plants, especially during dry periods. 

45
00:08:46,896 --> 00:08:52,895
This helps orchids grow steadily.

46
00:08:55,894 --> 00:09:02,893
Some substances in cucumber peel have antibacterial properties, 

47
00:09:02,893 --> 00:09:10,891
Helps orchids resist some diseases and harmful bacteria.

48
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:23,889
Rice water contains many important nutrients such as starch, 

49
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:29,887
protein, B vitamins and trace minerals, 

50
00:09:29,887 --> 00:09:36,886
Helps provide necessary nutrients for orchid growth. 

51
00:09:38,886 --> 00:09:48,884
These nutrients support growth, especially root and flower development.

52
00:10:00,881 --> 00:10:06,880
Be careful not to spray this fertilizer on the flowers

53
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:16,065
Because when flowers get wet, they easily fall off

54
00:10:28,876 --> 00:10:33,875
How to care for weak orchids

55
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:43,873
This orchid has withered leaves

56
00:10:43,873 --> 00:10:53,871
Orchid roots are fresh but very weak

57
00:10:58,274 --> 00:11:08,868
Clean the leaves to help remove dust and remove disease-causing fungi and leaf-damaging insects

58
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:18,900
This helps orchids photosynthesize light better

59
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:26,898
thereby making the tree more resistant

60
00:12:15,888 --> 00:12:23,886
When orchid roots turn silver, it means the orchid needs watering

61
00:12:25,886 --> 00:12:36,884
Water the orchid thoroughly with this water

62
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:08,877
Then spray this water on the entire orchid

63
00:13:08,877 --> 00:13:16,876
Then place the plant in a cool place with enough light so the orchid can grow

64
00:13:25,874 --> 00:13:28,873
Result

65
00:13:32,873 --> 00:13:42,871
This weak orchid has developed many new roots

66
00:14:11,898 --> 00:14:21,896
Other orchids' roots also grow very healthy

67
00:14:34,894 --> 00:14:43,892
flowers bloom brilliantly

68
00:14:45,891 --> 00:14:55,889
The flowers stay on the branches for a long time before fading

69
00:14:55,889 --> 00:15:00,888
Thank you for viewing. Wishing you luck and success in life
