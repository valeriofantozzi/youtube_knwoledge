subscribe so you won't miss any great

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,119
tips you can see that this Orchid hasn't

8
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:27,599
grown for 6 months its leaves are

9
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:31,960
gradually wilting the roots are rotting

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,960
and the plant is on the brink of dying

11
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:41,680
have you ever encountered a similar

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,440
situation and didn't know what to do to

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,440
save your beloved

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,280
Orchid uh first I'll carefully remove

15
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,120
all the wilted and damaged leaves this

16
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,440
is important because unhealthy leaves

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:00,399
can drain the plant's energy hindering

18
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,399
its recovery and growth

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,000
next I'll cut off all the damaged Roots

20
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,960
this is essential because rotten Roots

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,240
can spread Decay to healthy parts of the

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,970
plant preventing it from from absorbing

23
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:36,599
nutrients properly

25
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,920
uh finally I'll cut off any old flower

26
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,759
stems if present this helps the plant

27
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,790
Focus its energy on New Growth rather

28
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,919

wipe the leaves to help revive wilted
