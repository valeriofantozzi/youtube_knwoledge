Hello everyone. Today I continue to

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,120
share with you how to help orchid pots

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,160
that have unfortunately rotted recover,

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,080
grow back strongly, and bloom again soon

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,960
using only familiar ingredients

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,960
available in every household.

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,000
Uh during the process of growing

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,240
orchids, sometimes we will encounter

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,650
leaf rot, a fairly common phenomenon

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,439
caused by various reasons.

[Music]

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,399
Just like this orchid pot of mine, the

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,160
leaf rot is spreading very quickly. If

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,079
not treated in time, the disease can

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,320
attack the entire plant and cause the

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,480
orchid to weaken or even die in just a

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,480
few days.

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,680
Um, the main cause of soft rot in

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,160
orchids is fungi and bacteria attacking

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,559
the roots, stems, or leaves. Usually

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,960
when the plant is water logged, has poor

22
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,480
drainage or is exposed to high humidity

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,480
for a prolonged period.

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,840
Uh, one of the indirect causes of soft

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,000
rot disease in orchids is insects that

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,640
pierce or chew, creating open wounds on

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,640
the plant.

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,520
Oh, here you can see a slimy snail

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,760
crawling on an orchid flower. Therefore,

30
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,680
the cause of orchid rot can be insects

31
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,759
chewing and creating open wounds.

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,240
These wounds are the gateway for fungi

33
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,640
and bacteria to easily enter, especially

34
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,119
in humid conditions or when the plant is

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,119
not kept clean.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,759
Next, we need to check the roots and the

39
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,520
growing medium to see if they are

40
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,920
excessively wet or water logged.

41
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,000
You can see that the growing medium is

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,560
holding too much water causing water

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,850
logging. This is also one of the common

44
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:08,560
causes of soft rot in orchids.

[Music]

46
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,800
We need to completely remove the old

47
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,959
growing medium as it can be a place

48
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,120
where pathogens accumulate and retain

49
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:21,480
excessive moisture making the orchid

50
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,480
roots more vulnerable.

52
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,640
When the pot is not changed for a long

53
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,879
time, the growing medium can decay or

54
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,400
have poor drainage, easily retaining

55
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,959
water and creating conditions for

56
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,959
bacteria to grow, leading to soft rot in

57
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,959
orchids.

59
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,560
An excessively wet growing medium, high

60
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,660
humidity, and stagnant air create an

61
00:02:52,560 --> 00:03:02,240
ideal environment for fungal diseases.

When the growing medium decays and

64
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,640
retains too much water, but you continue

65
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,519
to water frequently, it keeps the medium

66
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,519
constantly wet, suffocates the roots,

67
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,519
prevents respiration, and creates

68
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,519
favorable conditions for bacteria to

69
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,519
thrive.

71
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,360
I recommend addressing the water logging

72
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,159
issue by watering only when the growing

73
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,680
medium is dry and at the same time

74
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,400
ensuring that the pot has excellent

75
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:39,040
drainage.

After completely removing the old

78
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,080
growing medium, we continue by cutting

79
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,560
off all the damaged roots to prevent the

80
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,570
disease from spreading and to help the

81
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,720
plant recover better.

83
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,519
Damaged and old roots usually lose their

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,920
ability to absorb water and nutrients.

85
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,840
If kept, they are not helpful and may

86
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,239
even cause rot to spread to healthy

87
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,400
roots. Removing them helps the plant

88
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,400
focus on nurturing stronger new roots.

90
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,639
Damaged roots are often vulnerable to

91
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,800
attacks by bacteria and fungi. If not

92
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,960
removed in time, pathogens can spread to

93
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,199
the healthy parts of the roots and stem,

94
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,199
causing soft rot or other serious

95
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,199
diseases.

96
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,320
When we cut off old and dead roots, the

97
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,560
plant naturally responds by pushing out

98
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,320
new roots, helping it recover faster,

Next, you need to prepare a methylene

119
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,720
blue solution, a mild antiseptic that

120
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,400

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,479
We only need to add about 10 drops of

123
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:28,960
methylene blue to create a gentle

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:30,720
antiseptic solution for the orchid.

125
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,400

It's truly wonderful to have you along

193
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,880
on this journey.

194
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,279
After finishing the treatment, you

195
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,920
should place the orchid pot in a cool,

196
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,240
wellventilated area with gentle light,

197
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,959
avoid direct rain, and do not water it

198
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,720
for 1 week. This helps the plant

199
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,279
stabilize, reduces the risk of

200
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,520
infection, and creates ideal conditions

201
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:59,600
for the wounds to heal faster.

[Music]

203
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,440
After one week without watering, once

204
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,519
the wounds have dried and the roots

205
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,279
begin to stabilize, we can start caring

206
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,920
for the orchid with a liquid fertilizer

207
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:15,559
to stimulate root and leaf growth again.

209
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,960

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:33,129
liquid fertilizer.

[Music]

212
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,079
I take one teaspoon of wheat flour and

213
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,320
mix it with one liter of room

214
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,560
temperature water. This mixture will

215
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,440
provide a gentle source of nutrients,

216
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:50,519
helping the orchid roots grow healthier.

[Music]

218
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,519
After mixing, you need to filter out the

219
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,200
residue to obtain a clear solution,

220
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,040
which helps the plant absorb it more

221
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,519
easily and prevents the growing medium

222
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,519
from getting dirty.

223
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,320
Um, pour the filtered solution into a

224
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:24,920
spray bottle, getting it ready to gently

225
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,920
and effectively care for your orchid.

227
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,720
Spray the solution evenly over the

228
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,720
entire orchid, including the leaves,

229
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,360
stem, and roots, so the plant can absorb

230
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,360
the nutrients optimally.

232
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,720
Then use this liquid fertilizer mixture

233
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,040
to water the roots and the growing

234
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,360
medium directly, nourishing the plant

235
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:11,079
from below and helping the roots absorb

236
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,079
nutrients more effectively.

[Music]

238
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,160
And remember to wipe off any water

239
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,399
remaining on the leaf surface and

240
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,480
between the leaf joints to prevent

241
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,279
creating conditions for bacteria and

242
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,600
fungi to grow.

243
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,920
You should care for your orchid using

244
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,480
the natural fertilizers I've shared on

245
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,560
the channel once every 2 weeks to help

246
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,720
the plant stay healthy and grow

247
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,720
sustainably.

248
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,880
Natural fertilization for orchids should

249
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,040
be done in the morning before the sun

250
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,279
becomes too intense to help the plant

251
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,440
absorb nutrients more easily and avoid

252
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,199
heat stress.

253
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,680
And place the orchid pot in a spot with

254
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,600
gentle sunlight and good air circulation

255
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,000
so the plant can recover and grow

256
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,000
better.

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,920
grown vigorously strong and full of

Because the orchid lost its crown, you

269
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,399
can see that from a node on the stem, it

270
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:50,340
has sprouted a new kei, a sign that its
