00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:39,525
Welcome to my channel

2
00:00:43,254 --> 00:00:51,102
In my hand is a package of seaweed.

3
00:00:51,102 --> 00:00:58,749
Seaweed is known to be a versatile food,

4
00:00:58,749 --> 00:01:02,426
nutritious and good for health.

5
00:01:02,426 --> 00:01:07,645
However, few people know that seaweed is also a great material to create fertilizer for plants,

6
00:01:07,645 --> 00:01:11,938
especially for orchids.

7
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:22,270
In this video, we will show you how to use seaweed to create a divine fertilizer to help orchids grow and bloom abundantly all year round.

8
00:01:23,111 --> 00:01:26,432
you use 1 piece of seaweed like this

9
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:33,035
and add 15-20 grams of fresh ginger

10
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:46,644
Add 1 liter of water at room temperature.

11
00:01:48,427 --> 00:01:52,974
puree

12
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:27,226
filter out residue

13
00:02:37,847 --> 00:02:40,979
STEP 1

14
00:02:42,706 --> 00:02:47,724
Use cotton balls

15
00:02:51,243 --> 00:02:57,676
Clean the top and bottom of the orchid leaves,

16
00:02:57,676 --> 00:03:03,270
Ginger has very good antiseptic properties

17
00:03:03,923 --> 00:03:10,073
Will help eliminate fungi and parasitic insects on orchids

18
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:19,993
At the same time, ginger and seaweed contain many essential minerals for plant growth

19
00:03:21,516 --> 00:03:30,742
Orchid will be able to absorb some nutrients through the leaves

20
00:03:32,925 --> 00:03:40,159
keep green leaves

21
00:03:42,476 --> 00:03:50,934
Regularly wiping the leaves will help open the stomata

22
00:03:52,500 --> 00:04:03,716
The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide will be more favorable

23
00:04:05,257 --> 00:04:11,960
Orchid will synthesize chlorophyll more easily

24
00:04:12,983 --> 00:04:21,478
leaves will always be green

25
00:04:23,173 --> 00:04:31,668
sturdy orchid

26
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:41,080
thick leaves grow very well

27
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,934
You need to clean the orchid leaves once a month

28
00:04:48,268 --> 00:04:51,934
STEP 2

29
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:59,054
Use up ginger juice with seaweed

30
00:04:59,054 --> 00:05:08,220
Add 2 liters of water

31
00:05:09,825 --> 00:05:20,111
I soaked the orchid in this water for 5 minutes

32
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:31,975
Seaweed contains many nutrients and minerals that are beneficial for plant growth, especially for orchids such as:

33
00:05:31,975 --> 00:05:44,508
Nitrogen (N): Helps promote the growth of leaves, shoots, branches and roots,

34
00:05:44,508 --> 00:06:01,528
Phosphorus (P): Plays an important role in promoting root and flower growth.

35
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:16,036
Potassium (K): Helps plants withstand stress, enhances resistance and minimizes the impact of pests.

36
00:06:16,036 --> 00:06:28,525
Calcium (Ca): Enhances resistance and helps plants develop muscle and bone systems of orchids.

37
00:06:28,525 --> 00:06:38,728
Magnesium (Mg): Has an effect on the metabolism of the plant, helping the plant grow healthy.

38
00:06:38,728 --> 00:06:53,744
Thanks to the abundant nutrition of seaweed, the use of fertilizers from seaweed helps to provide a full range of nutrients

39
00:06:53,744 --> 00:07:03,734
and minerals necessary for orchids to grow healthy.

40
00:07:03,734 --> 00:07:19,958
Contribute to providing enough nutrients for orchids to help plants produce more flowers

41
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:27,546
The flower is larger and more vibrant.

42
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:35,698
In addition, seaweed also contains a polysaccharide called carrageenan,

43
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:43,011
Has the effect of reducing stress of plants, helping plants to resist the effects of UV rays

44
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:50,851
and inhibit the growth of bacteria and mold.

45
00:07:50,851 --> 00:07:58,872
Thus, orchids are protected from pests, fungi and bacteria and grow abundantly all year round.

46
00:08:00,205 --> 00:08:03,205
Welcome to part 2 of this video

47
00:08:03,205 --> 00:08:11,870
You see this is a withered orchid.

48
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:37,898
Now let me show you how to revive this orchid.

49
00:08:37,898 --> 00:08:49,896
I use 1 small ginger.

50
00:08:49,896 --> 00:09:16,890
Squeeze out the water to soak the orchid branches in ginger water.

51
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:22,889
Wait for it to dry.

52
00:09:25,888 --> 00:09:34,887
Use a molten candle to apply on the cut

53
00:09:34,887 --> 00:09:42,885
Doing so will not allow water to seep inside the orchid,

54
00:09:42,885 --> 00:09:48,884
This will prevent the orchid from rotting and from losing water.

55
00:09:56,882 --> 00:10:30,876
I will recycle it into a miniature greenhouse to revive the orchid.

56
00:11:34,896 --> 00:11:51,893
Place the orchid in the moss and mist it to keep it moist.

57
00:11:51,893 --> 00:12:05,890
Put it in a cool place and mist it every 5 days.

58
00:12:13,888 --> 00:12:23,886
AFTER 3 WEEKS

59
00:12:33,885 --> 00:12:53,881
The little sprout has come back to life.

60
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:11,877
Continue to keep in a cool place and mist once every 5 days.

61
00:13:14,876 --> 00:13:37,872
AFTER 3 MONTHS

62
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:16,897
Lan has successfully revived with extremely strong roots

63
00:14:19,897 --> 00:14:47,891
To prevent the orchid from root rot, I will replant it with pine bark and pumice stone.

64
00:15:09,887 --> 00:15:27,883
From now on, water once every 7-10 days to keep moist.

65
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:41,881
combine using organic fertilizers like I shared on the channel to take care of them,

66
00:15:41,881 --> 00:15:48,879
Will help orchids grow better

Welcome to part 3 of this video

70
00:16:04,876 --> 00:16:17,873
Today I share a little trick to help stimulate many small orchids on an old orchid branch.

71
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:51,900
I used a small clove of garlic.

72
00:16:53,900 --> 00:17:16,895
Squeeze water.

73
00:17:34,892 --> 00:17:57,887
Apply fresh garlic juice to the places where small orchids can grow.

74
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:47,877
AFTER 1 WEEK.

75
00:18:47,877 --> 00:19:05,874
Small orchids have grown bigger.

76
00:19:05,874 --> 00:19:19,871
AFTER 2 MONTHS

77
00:19:51,898 --> 00:20:16,893
This orchid I also apply this little trick and it also grows a lot of small orchids.

78
00:20:16,893 --> 00:20:26,891
