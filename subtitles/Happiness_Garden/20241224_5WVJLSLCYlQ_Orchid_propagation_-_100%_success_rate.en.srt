00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,160
orchids are about to fall this is the

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,410
right time to cut branches to propagate

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,600
these nodes still contain dormant buds

9
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,720
so they can be used to propagate orchids

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:53,239

00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:57,359
spikes and these nodes have already

13
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:01,519
bloomed so cut them off as they can no
