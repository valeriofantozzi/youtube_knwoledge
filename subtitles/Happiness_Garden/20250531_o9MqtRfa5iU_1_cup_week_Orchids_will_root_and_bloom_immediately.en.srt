14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,440
promotes vigorous orchid growth with

15
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,760

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,040

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,040
disinfect the growing medium to ensure

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,760
it is disease-free and safe for the

27
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,760

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,960
The best way to disinfect the growing

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,010
medium is to soak it in hot water, which

31
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:37,240
effectively removes harmful bacteria and

32
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:40,320

33
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,400
fungi. I soak the pine bark in hot water

34
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,799
for about 2 hours to disinfect the

35
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,960
growing medium. When soaking, the water

36
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,600
penetrates deeply inside, helping the

37
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,439
pine bark not to dry out when planted

38
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,920
and maintaining suitable moisture for

39
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,920
the plant's

42
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,710
make natural fertilizer is turmeric

43
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,910

45
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:24,280
Take one spoon of turmeric powder. Then

46
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,280
mix it with 0.5 L of boiling water.

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:47,720
cool completely before

52
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:57,480
natural fertilizer is

53
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:57,480
rice. Take three spoons of rice.

55
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,360
Then mix three spoons of rice with 0.5 L

56
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,360
of room temperature

57
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,280
water. Then wait about 1 hour for the

58
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,280
rice to absorb the

59
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:23,200
water. Um after about 1 to two years,

60
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,200
the orchid growing medium will rot,

61
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,519
losing its ability to drain water and

62
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,920
allow air circulation due to long-term

63
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:34,100
use. Therefore, we need to replace the

64
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,360
medium to help the plant grow better.

[Music]

66
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,879
This rot is a sign that the orchid's

67
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,599
roots are suffocating. So, the growing

68
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,599
medium needs to be replaced to save the

69
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,879
plant. Additionally, if you see the

70
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,440
orchid's roots have become too crowded,

71
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,519
the orchid grows slowly, or the growing

72
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,920
medium is no longer loose and airy, it's

73
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,920
also time to repot and replace the

74
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,920
medium.

76
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,840
You can see that the growing medium

77
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,200
holds too much water, causing many old

78
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,959
roots to suffocate and rot. If the pot

79
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,359
is not changed in time, the rot can

80
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,079
gradually spread to the stem and leaves,

Because the growing medium has rotted

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,039

[Music]

193
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,240
Then spray the mixture on both the top

194
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,560
and underside of the orchid leaves for

195
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,560
better

196
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:28,800
[Music]

197
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:31,040
absorption. You spray the mixture onto

198
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,279
the aerial roots that have not been

199
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:37,399
soaked, helping the roots absorb

200
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,399
nutrients and grow better.

201
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,800
Spraying on the leaves helps wash away

202
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,800
dust, fungal diseases, and insect larvy

203
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,550
residing on the leaves, especially on

204
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:55,900
the underside and leaf crevices.

205
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,900

206
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:07,199
[Music]

207
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,120
Then use a soft cloth to gently wipe off

208
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,880
the water droplets on the leaves and

209
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,990
leaf crevices to keep the leaves

210
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,990
[Music]

211
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:20,560
dry. Uh this helps keep the orchid

212
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,720
leaves clean, limits the development of

213
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,720
fungal diseases, and keeps the plant

214
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,720
healthier.

215
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,079
After planting, you should place the

216
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,800
orchid pot in a spot with gentle

217
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,560
sunlight and avoid watering for one week

218
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,440
to help the plant adapt and reduce

219
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,440
stress after

220
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:47,199
repotting. Uh after one week, you start

221
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,360
watering and fertilizing with natural

222
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,959
fertilizers like I shared on the channel

223
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,430
two to three times per month for the

224
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:57,680
orchid.

225
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:59,759
[Music]

226
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,920
And here is the orchid from the same

227
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,300
batch that I repotted and changed the

228
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:08,059
growing medium

229
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:08,059
[Music]

230
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:13,040
earlier. Um, you can see the orchid

231
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,120
leaves are sturdy and healthy and the

232
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,360
flowers bloom in many clusters on the

233
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,360
same branch.

234
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,360
The orchid petals are soft and delicate

235
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:30,079
like velvet with bright colors shining

236
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,320
under gentle sunlight. Each petal curves

237
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:35,320
gracefully creating a gentle yet elegant

238
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,320
beauty.

239
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,480
The orchid roots are thick, strong,

240
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,880
ivory colored, and freely extending

241
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,279
within the growing medium. The roots are

242
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,440
soft yet very tough, helping the plant

243
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,120
anchor firmly and effectively absorb

244
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,440
water and nutrients to nourish the

245
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,440
entire plant.

246
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,240
When you care for the orchid with all

247
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,319
the love you have for plants, you will

248
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,679
be rewarded with the plant's radiant

249
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,679
beauty and vigorous

250
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:16,559
vitality. The vibrant flowers blooming

251
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,919
all year round in the garden will help

252
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,919
you feel joy and peace

253
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:24,799
