Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:46,891
These are orchids after the flowers have withered.

3
00:00:52,165 --> 00:01:02,888
Once the flower stalk has bloomed, it will no longer be able to produce buds.

4
00:01:30,638 --> 00:01:42,880
But at the tip of this withered flower branch, many flower buds can still continue to grow.

5
00:01:55,738 --> 00:02:05,876
To help the orchid continue to bloom, I use 20 grams of beetroot.

6
00:02:29,808 --> 00:02:39,869
I added about 20 grams of aloe vera leaves.

7
00:02:56,899 --> 00:03:06,897
Puree in 400ml of water.

8
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:45,889
Filter out residue.

9
00:04:09,618 --> 00:04:19,882
Pour the juice from beets and aloe vera leaves into cotton balls.

10
00:04:32,858 --> 00:04:42,878
Clip on a withered flower branch.

11
00:04:50,876 --> 00:05:00,874
Beets and aloe vera are rich sources of potassium, an important mineral that promotes plant health.

12
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:19,870
Natural potassium helps orchids develop buds and flowers very effectively.

13
00:06:42,217 --> 00:06:52,885
I mixed the remaining beet juice and aloe vera with water to make 2 liters of liquid fertilizer.

14
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:11,882
Then water the orchid roots with this water once a week.

15
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:25,879
The presence of phosphorus in this fertilizer helps orchids grow strongly and have good flowering ability.

16
00:07:29,806 --> 00:07:39,876
Then I use this water to clean the top and bottom of the leaves.

17
00:07:55,106 --> 00:08:05,871
When the cotton is dry, spray moisturizer regularly.

18
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:15,869
and water the roots.

19
00:08:17,756 --> 00:08:26,900
Change the cotton once a week.

20
00:08:46,084 --> 00:08:50,895
1 MONTH LATER.

21
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:12,891
The tips of the withered flower branches have sprouted many new flower buds.

22
00:09:57,882 --> 00:10:07,880
With this simple method, wilted orchids will grow many new healthy flower buds.

23
00:10:31,613 --> 00:10:35,875
2 MONTH LATER.

24
00:10:36,874 --> 00:10:46,872
This is the orchid I have applied in the newly shared way.

25
00:10:52,357 --> 00:11:02,869
The wilted orchid has grown many beautiful flowers.

26
00:11:03,936 --> 00:11:11,867
