00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,320
especially with natural fertilizers that

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,000

17
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:42,239
started. Um, to keep the orchid fresh

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,800
and healthy, we need to regularly check

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,120
and remove old roots, yellowing leaves,

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,719
and damaged flower spikes. This is the

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,200
way to rejuvenate the plant and prepare

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,200
it for new growth.

Damaged roots, if not cut off in time,

25
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,920
will weaken the plant, make it prone to

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,080
pests and diseases, and hinder the

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,360
nutrient absorption process, thereby

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,530
negatively affecting the growth and

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:16,719

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,599
that nutrients concentrate on the

49
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,920
remaining flowers on the stem, helping

50
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,040
the blooms last longer and the flower

51
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:27,360

natural compound that can repel harmful

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,360
insects from orchids. In addition,

68
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,760
tobacco also helps clean the surface of

69
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,280

First, it helps repel harmful insects

living in the growing medium, protecting

You can see that this tear on the leaf

156
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,760

00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,279

159
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,760
leaves, then burrow into the growing

160
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,680
medium to gnaw on new roots. This

161
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,279
weakens the orchid, slows its growth,

162
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,279
and makes it more susceptible to

163
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,399

164

165
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,320
growing medium will be forced to come

166
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,519

167
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,519

For the tear on the leaf caused by
