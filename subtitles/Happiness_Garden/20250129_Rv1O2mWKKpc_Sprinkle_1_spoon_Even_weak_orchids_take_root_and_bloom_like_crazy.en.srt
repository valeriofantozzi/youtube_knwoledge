hello everyone today I will share a

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,520
great way to revive wilted orchids

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,520
helping them grow strong and Bloom

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:27,480
beautifully let's explore

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:31,000
together these are orchids that people

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,000
have thrown away

8
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,120
this Orchid is dead so it cannot be

00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,829
[Music]

10
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:54,220
revived this plant is also dead so it

11
00:00:51,760 --> 00:01:05,710
cannot be revived

12
00:00:54,220 --> 00:01:05,710

[Music]

14
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:18,280
this Orchid is wilted but still alive so

15
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,280
I decided to bring it home to revive it

16
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,239

[Music]

19
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,950
you need to check the roots and cut off

20
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:03,280
all the damaged ones

21
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:04,719
[Music]

22
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,479
cutting them off helps stop the spread

23
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,239
of bacteria mold and other

24
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:12,520
diseases after cutting the Orchid will

25
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,599
focus its energy on the healthy Roots

26
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,599
helping the plant grow

27
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:23,629
[Music]

28
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,239
better then cut off the old orchid

29
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,760
flower spikes and withered Leaf stocks

30
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,840
to help the plant Focus its energy on

31
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,080
developing new parts including fresh

32
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,080
flower spikes and

33
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,319
leaves when the flowers have faded faded

34
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,800
or the leaf stalks become dry and wilted

35
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,800
cutting them off not only makes the

36
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,239
plant look tidier but also prevents the

37
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,800
spread of diseases this helps the orchid

38
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:52,400
bloom more vigorously and grow healthier

39
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,400
in the next season

40
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,080
then soaking the wilted orchid in water

41
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,840
for about 1 hour is a simple yet

42
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,879
effective method to help the plant

43
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,840
recover this provides moisture to the

44
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,879
roots making it easier for them to

45
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,159
absorb water and

46
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,480
nutrients soaking the Orchid also helps

47
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:33,159
remove any toxins or dirt that may be

48
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,599
present on the roots creating a better

49
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:38,040
environment for the plant to recover

50
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:38,040
quickly and grow

51
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,720
healthier take a/ teaspoon of sugar

52
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:07,000
add it to one liter of

53
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,840
water sugar helps revive wilted orchids

54
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,720
by providing an easy source of energy

55
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,280
for the

56
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,239
plant uh when the Orchid is wilted it

57
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,720
may lack energy due to the roots not

58
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,720
functioning effectively or being

59
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,080
damaged remember to stir well to ensure

60
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,720
the sugar completely dissolves in the

61
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,720
water

62
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:38,840
take one liter of

63
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,880
water and add 3 teaspoons of

64
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,800
breadcrumbs breadcrumbs can help the

65
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,479
Orchid quickly recover and develop Roots

66
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,479
due to the Nutritional components they

67
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,720
contain such as vitamin and vams and

68
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,400
minerals when soaked in water they

69
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,479
create a solution that provides

70
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,880
beneficial nutrients giving energy to

71
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,600
the plant in particular breadcrumbs can

72
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,039
stimulate the growth of beneficial

73
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,560
bacteria in the soil improving the root

74
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:18,479
environment and promoting the

75
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,479
development of new

00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:31,639
the or

78
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,639
kid then immerse the wilted leaves in

79
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,639
the diluted sugar water for about 20

80
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,639
minutes

81
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,680
the sugar water provides energy to the

82
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,479
leaves helping them absorb nutrients and

83
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,440
moisture more effectively this process

84
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:23,720
also stimulates cell regeneration aiding

85
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,720
in the rapid recovery of the leaves

86
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,919
then remove it and wipe off any excess

87
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,919
water from the

88
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:57,879

99
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:59,199
quickly the sugar provides carbohydrates

100
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,000
giving the plant extra energy while the

101
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,159
bread crumbs Supply vitamins and

102
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,360
minerals stimulating the growth of roots

133
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:19,880
soak the roots for about 20 minutes to

134
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,480
allow the Orchid to absorb the water and

135
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,480
nutrients

136
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,720
effectively then take the Orchid pot out

137
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:31,240
and place it in a location with plenty

138
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,240
of light but avoid Direct

139
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,320
sunlight to protect the plant you should

140
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,560
place the Orchid in areas with indirect

141
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,320
light or shade especially during the

142
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,320
intense midday

143
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,920
Sun after soaking for 20 minutes remove

144
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,920
the wilted

145
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:56,200
Orchid you can see that the Orchid Roots

146
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,880
have become fresher and Greener after

147
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,240
soaking in this mixed solution for 20

148
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,240
minutes

149
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,320
now I'm planting the Orchid in a new pot

150
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:11,320
to make the recovery process

151
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,440
easier uh I use spagna Moss as the

152
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:19,320
growing medium for the Orchid to help

153
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,360
retain

155
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,440
growing medium because it can hold water

156
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:28,360
for a long time and creates a stable

157
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,160

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,720
to care for the plant by ensuring it

183
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,959
receives enough light moisture and

184
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:50,639
appropriate fertilization so the Orchid

185
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:50,639
