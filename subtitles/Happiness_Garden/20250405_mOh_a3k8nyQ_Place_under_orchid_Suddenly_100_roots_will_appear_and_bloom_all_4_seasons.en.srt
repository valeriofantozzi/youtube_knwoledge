Hello everyone. Welcome to the Happiness

00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,240
Garden

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,920
channel. Today I'll share an amazing tip

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,000
for taking care of orchids after their

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,920
flowers have faded. This method is

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,750
especially effective for helping wilted

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,600
or weak orchids recover and grow

8
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,199
[Music]

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,960
quickly. This is an orchid that has

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,600
already bloomed but became wilted and

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,519
stunted, so it was discarded.

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,240
I picked it up with the hope of reviving

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,119
it and helping it grow strong again.

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,119
Let's see how I do

15
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:37,800
it. First, trim off the old flower spike

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,320
that has long

17
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,079
withered. This helps the plant redirect

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,000
nutrients to root and leaf growth

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,000
instead of sustaining the dried flower

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
stem.

21
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:53,059
[Music]

22
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,359
Next, upon checking the roots, I found

23
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,840
many inorganic fertilizer pellets in

24
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,840
green and

25
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,709
[Music]

26
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,640
gray. Uh, this orchid may have wilted

27
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,880
because the inorganic fertilizer damaged

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,720
its roots, preventing it from absorbing

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,280
water and nutrients, which caused the

30
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,119
leaves to wilt. Therefore, we need to

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,940
remove these fertilizer pellets and

32
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:29,180
treat the roots to help the plant

33
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:29,180
[Music]

34
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,799
recover. The roots are severely damaged

35
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:47,000
and dry. Uh this prevents the plant from

36
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,000
absorbing water and nutrients.

37

[Music]

38
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,239
Uh, the next step is to trim off the

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,599
damaged roots so the plant can focus on

40
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,599
growing new, healthier ones.

41
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,000
Next, rinse the roots thoroughly with

42
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,000
water.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,239
This removes any remaining dirt, old

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,959
fertilizer, and damaged parts, preparing

45
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,959
the plant for

46
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:00,560
recovery. Which country are you watching

[Music]

52
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,959
To make natural fertilizer, I first take

53
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,400
one teaspoon of honey. Honey provides

54
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,239
natural nutrients and supports the

55
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,239
plant's growth in a safe and effective

56
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,239
way.

57
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,080
Dilute the honey in one liter of

58
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,840
water. This makes the solution lighter,

59
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,599
allowing it to easily penetrate the

60
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,879
leaves and roots without causing harm

61
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,879
while effectively providing nutrients.

62
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,650
[Music]

63
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,840
Next, I take one aloe vera leaf as it is

64
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,640
excellent for helping wilted or stunted

65
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,799
orchids recover. Aloe vera provides

66
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,720
moisture and natural nutrients to help

67
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,720
the plant recover quickly and grow

68
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:31,100
strong. Add the aloe vera leaf to about

69
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:34,179
300 ml of water.

00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,179
[Music]

71
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,120
Then blend the aloe vera with a blender

72
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,040
until smooth. This ensures the aloe vera

73
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,600
is fully mixed into the water, creating

74
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,600
a fine, smooth solution that can easily

75
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,600
absorb into the roots and leaves of the

76
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,600
orchid.

77
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,560
Strain out any pulp or residue from the

78
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,400
aloe vera

79
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,240
mixture. This makes the solution smooth,

80
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,160
ensuring it can easily penetrate the

81
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,960
plant without clogging or causing damage

82
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,960
to the roots and leaves.

84
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,759
Place the aloe vera leaf in a cup and

85
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,520
pour the aloe vera water over it,

86
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,800
letting it soak for about 20

87
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,400
minutes. This method helps provide

88
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,000
moisture and essential nutrients,

89
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,400
speeding up the recovery process for

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,400
wilted orchids.

92
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,360
After soaking for 20 minutes, remove the

93
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,280
orchid and wipe off any excess mixture

94
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,280
on the

95
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,759
leaves. This helps prevent overwatering

96
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,639
or excess mixture, reducing the risk of

97
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,639
leaf or root rot.

98
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,240
Place the orchid roots into the cup.

99
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,759
This makes it easier to observe and

100
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,240

101
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,240
recovery

102
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:16,120
process. Now mix the honey with the aloe

103
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,120
vera mixture.

104
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,479
And here is vitamin B1, which is great

105
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,520
for recovering wilted leaves and

106
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,520
encouraging new root

107
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,160
growth. Vitamin B1 helps strengthen the

108
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,599
plant's resistance and supports its

109
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,599
quick recovery after stress or weakness.

110
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,479
Then pour this mixture and soak the

111
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,000
orchid roots for about 20

112
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,919
minutes. This helps provide all the

113
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,440
necessary nutrients and vitamins,

114
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,440
accelerating the plant's recovery

115
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,440

After soaking for 20 minutes, we take

118
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:29,919
the orchid out and plant it into a new

119
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:32,000
pot. Planting it into a new pot provides

120
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,919
the plant with the best conditions to

121
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,919
grow and absorb nutrients from fresh

122
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,919
soil.

123
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,800
I plant the orchid using moss to help

124
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,399
retain

125
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,000
moisture. Moss is a fantastic natural

126
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:56,120
material that maintains humidity and

127
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,120

131
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,360

mist the orchid to maintain

139
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,880

193
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,079
every 10

194
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:58,560
days. This will help the plant maintain

195
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:03,480
its health and continue to develop

196
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,480
strong roots and leaves in the future.

Next, use a soft cotton pad to soak up

199
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,480
the mixture and gently wipe both the top

200
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,760
and bottom sides of the

201
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,680
leaves. This helps provide nutrients

202
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,040
directly to the leaves and remove dirt,

203
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,040
promoting better plant health and

204
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,040
growth.

206
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,279
Then place the orchid pot in a spot with

207
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,720
gentle

208
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:26,720
sunlight. Remember, while fertilizer is

209
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,880
beneficial, without sufficient sunlight,

210
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:33,880
the orchid won't synthesize nutrients

211
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,880
properly, leading to stunted growth.

213
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,560
The result after the next 2 months is

214
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,560
that the orchid has grown very well with

215
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:56,160
many new roots and healthy

216
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:58,560
leaves. The natural care method with

217
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:02,519
honey, aloe vera, and vitamin B1 has

218
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,519
proven to be highly effective.

220
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,600
You can see the orchid has grown many

221
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,600
new healthy

222
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,400
leaves. And it has also sprouted a new

223
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,839
flower shoot which proves that the

224
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,360
orchid has fully recovered.

225
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,120
This is a wonderful sign that the plant

226
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,120
is thriving and ready to bloom

227
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,720
soon. Care for your orchids with all the

228
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:33,200
love and tenderness in your heart, and

229
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:35,200
nature will always reward your efforts.

230
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,440
Every drop of water, every moment of

231
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,799
care is a gift that brings life, vibrant

232
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,799
blooms, and endless

233
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,679
joy. Thank you for watching. Wishing you

234
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,240
a joyful and energetic day. Goodbye and

235
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,240
see you next time.
