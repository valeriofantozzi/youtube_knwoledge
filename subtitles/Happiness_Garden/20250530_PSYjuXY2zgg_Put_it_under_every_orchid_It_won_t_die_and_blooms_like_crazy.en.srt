Hello

2
00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:05,879
friends. Today I will guide you when to

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,240
water

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:10,639
orchids. When orchid roots are green

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:15,559
like this, the orchid has enough water.

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,559
The leaves will be green and sturdy.

00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:28,880
[Music]

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,920
But if the roots turn white, the plant

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,440
is lacking

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,000
water. Check the potting medium. You

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,000
will find it very

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,879
dry. Leaves will wilt very quickly if we

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,879
don't water them in

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,760
time. In this case, we need to quickly

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,760
water the

16
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:56,760
orchid. How to water as following.

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,600
Place the orchid pot in a deep dish and

18
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,600
water the substrate completely.

[Music]

20
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,720
If the roots are still fresh, but the

21
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,280
leaves are wilted, we can soak the

22
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:52,230
orchid in water for 20 to 30

24
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:01,119
minutes. Uh, with pots using moss

25
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,799
growing medium, the ability to retain

26
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,680
moisture is very good. So, we only need

27
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,850
to water enough

28
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:11,110
moisture and no need to

30
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,160
soak. When you eat a banana, don't throw

31
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,160
away the

32
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,080
peel. Banana peel contains a lot of

33
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,400
vitamins and minerals. Vitamins's A, B,

34
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,720
C, E, and protein, phosphorus.

35
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,640
Especially rich in potassium. Potassium

36
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,640
resists drought very well. Helps the

37
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,879
orchid to transport water from the root

38
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,959
to the top so the orchid does not

39
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:40,640
wilt. At the same time, potassium helps

40
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,800
to stimulate flower growth and keep

41
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,800
flowers fresh for a long time.

46
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,519
a jar. Pour 500 milllers of boiled

47
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,800
water, about two cups, and let it sit

48
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,980
for one day to let the nutrients

49
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:39,569

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,880
You can also use a cotton ball soaked in

Vitamin B1 helps stimulate root growth.

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,039
not overdo it. It will harm the orchid.
