00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:03,866
welcome to this video this is a Dendrobium orchid

2
00:00:03,866 --> 00:00:06,300
a type of orchid that is said to be beautiful

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,518
and has a gentle fragrance

4
00:00:14,117 --> 00:00:17,833
in this video I share an easy way to propagate the most

5
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:21,287
beautiful orchids in the world

6
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:28,000
um if you haven't subscribed to the channel yet

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,433
please subscribe so you don't miss any tips and share

8
00:00:31,433 --> 00:00:33,597
so as many people know

9
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,470
let's get started

10
00:00:47,866 --> 00:00:51,674
I cut this old orchid for propagation

11
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:07,676
cut again so the cut is flat and will not rot further

12
00:01:15,924 --> 00:01:18,500
applying cinnamon powder to the cut

13
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,259
helps the wound heal quickly and not rot

14
00:01:28,143 --> 00:01:31,433
then wait a day for the cutting to dry completely

15
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:33,570
before planting the orchid

16
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:35,466
please comment to me

17
00:01:35,466 --> 00:01:37,900
which country you are watching the video from

18
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:39,800
it's great that we can chat together

19
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,000
from all over the world

20
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,588
one day later

21
00:01:47,715 --> 00:01:51,989
take 1 aloe Vera leaf and cut it into thin slices

22
00:01:55,592 --> 00:02:00,066
aloe Vera gel is very good at restoring wilted orchids

23
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:03,093
and reviving baby orchids

24
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,166
then

25
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:12,000
take 2 cloves of garlic and cut them into thin slices

26
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:19,233
garlic has antibacterial and antiseptic properties

27
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:23,747
that help protect orchids from rotting

28
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,633
put garlic and aloe Vera in the jar

29
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:41,495
and add 500 milliliters of water

30
00:03:15,727 --> 00:03:18,362
the cut is completely dry

31
00:03:28,514 --> 00:03:32,366
soaking in this water for 30 minutes

32
00:03:32,566 --> 00:03:36,929
helps stimulate germination and rooting

33
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:49,255
recycle used plastic bottles as orchid nursery tools

34
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,500
then

35
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,046
put the dry orchid branches into this plastic bottle

36
00:04:48,631 --> 00:04:52,566
place the bottle here and insert moss around it

37
00:04:52,566 --> 00:04:55,684
to help retain moisture

38
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:38,396
water regularly to keep the environment moist

39
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,552
this helps the orchid germinate faster

40
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,100
then put it in a cool place

41
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,698
and wait for the orchid to revive

42
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,740
45 days later

43
00:06:59,317 --> 00:07:02,833
with this method after only 45 days old

44
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:06,537
withered orchid branches have been revived

45
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:47,404
now I cut them out to plant in pots

46
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:54,800
I plant with pine bark soaked in antiseptic

47
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,457
to prevent the tree from rotting

48
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,166
adding a little moss helps retain moisture

49
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:19,331
and protect the roots better

50
00:08:42,911 --> 00:08:46,166
then you water it to keep it moist and take care of it

51
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:49,460
like other normal orchids

52
00:08:50,718 --> 00:08:53,100
thank you for watching the video

53
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,717
wishing you luck and happiness in life

54
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,062
welcome to my channel

55
00:09:09,058 --> 00:09:13,766
when the last phalenopsis orchids are about to fall

56
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:15,400
this is the right time to cut branches

57
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:20,111
to propagate phalenopsis orchids from flower stems

58
00:09:42,334 --> 00:09:45,000
these nodes still contain dormant buds

59
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,666
so they can be used to propagate orchids

60
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,180
from flower spikes

61
00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:55,833
and these nodes have already bloomed

62
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:56,766
so cut them off

63
00:09:56,766 --> 00:10:00,382
as they can no longer be used for propagation

64
00:10:35,837 --> 00:10:38,200
after that I use a potato

65
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,300
to create a substance that helps propagate orchids

66
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,241
quickly

67
00:11:02,424 --> 00:11:05,266
potatoes contain many substances

68
00:11:05,266 --> 00:11:08,978
necessary for the growth of orchids

69
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:33,217
I will recycle potato peels into organic fertilizer

70
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:44,956
pour 1 liter of hot water into the jar

71
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,416
then brew until the water cools

72
00:12:01,117 --> 00:12:04,100
need to peel off the protective film

73
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,959
of the sleeping sprout

74
00:12:11,766 --> 00:12:15,878
this will help the sprouts grow faster

75
00:12:43,766 --> 00:12:49,278
apply potato gel to the sleeping sprouts

76
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:04,772
this helps stimulate sprout growth

77
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:19,174
next apply toothpaste on the cut

78
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:33,066
helps cuts heal faster

79
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:57,857
wrap with thinly sliced potatoes

80
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:23,134
this helps moisturize and awaken dormant sprouts

81
00:14:32,234 --> 00:14:34,400
leave for 6 hours

82
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,990
to let the nutrients from the potatoes penetrate inside

83
00:14:48,766 --> 00:14:52,990
take 1 teaspoon of cinnamon powder

84
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:02,207
add 1 liter of hot water

85
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:25,317
after the water cools filter to remove sediment

86
00:15:45,246 --> 00:15:50,566
soak terracotta beads and aquaponic resin

87
00:15:50,566 --> 00:15:56,478
beads in cinnamon water solution for 30 minutes

88
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:16,240
soak the moss in the cinnamon solution for 30 minutes

89
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,464
recycle used boxes into orchid sprouting tools

90
00:17:24,766 --> 00:17:30,159
conduct orchid nursery

91
00:17:59,566 --> 00:18:05,552
spray moisturizer every three days

92
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,250
place in a cool place

93
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,713
when cool filtered remove residue

94
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:38,266
um watering this liquid fertilizer for orchids

95
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:43,511
one to two times a month will be very good

96
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:15,438
the sleeping sprouts have awakened

97
00:19:43,832 --> 00:19:48,033
continue spraying water

98
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:54,697
and leave in a cool place for the sprouts to grow

99
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:15,793
after next one month

100
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,366
the sprout has grown leaves

101
00:20:42,021 --> 00:20:46,366
continue spraying water

102
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,152
and leave in a cool place for the sprouts to grow

103
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,382
after the next two month

104
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,780
small orchids grow very quickly

105
00:21:50,741 --> 00:21:53,900
with this simple way

106
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:58,139
you can propagate orchids at home easily

107
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:15,469
hope the video will help you a lot

108
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,800
now I will plant it in a pot

109
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,765
so the orchid can grow in the outside environment

110
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:48,700
uh if you find the video meaningful

then nurture the

114
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,633
orchid with water and organic fertilizer

115
00:23:12,633 --> 00:23:14,666
as I shared on the Happiness Garden Channel

116
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:16,400
and take care of it

117
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,266
with all the love you have for the plant

118
00:23:18,266 --> 00:23:23,122
