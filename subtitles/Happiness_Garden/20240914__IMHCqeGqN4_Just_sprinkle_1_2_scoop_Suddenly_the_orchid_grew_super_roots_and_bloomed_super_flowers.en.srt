00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
🌿 Welcome to the little garden full of joy! Let's explore the beauty of orchids. 

2
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:10,898
If your orchids become weak or fail to bloom due to improper care, don’t worry! 

3
00:00:10,898 --> 00:00:15,897
🌸 Improve their environment, provide proper nutrition, and adjust watering. 

4
00:00:15,897 --> 00:00:18,030
With patience, they will recover and bloom again! 💜✨

5
00:00:18,563 --> 00:00:21,896
Let's get started!

6
00:00:22,896 --> 00:00:28,895
This is an orchid infected with leaf rot caused by a fungus.

7
00:00:35,893 --> 00:00:41,892
We need to separate the diseased plant from other orchids.

8
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:48,891
Now I will share how to restore this rotten orchid with only 1 leaf left.

9
00:00:58,889 --> 00:01:05,887
Cut off all damaged roots.

12
00:01:19,885 --> 00:01:25,883
Leave fresh roots like this.

13
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:43,880
then rinse with water.

14
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:50,879
In addition to the English dub, we've now created dubs in French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, 

15
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:58,877
Japanese, Hindi, and Indonesian to help you hear and understand the content more easily.

16
00:02:03,876 --> 00:02:08,875
OH! This leaf also falls.

17
00:02:17,772 --> 00:02:25,872
Watch me restore this leafless orchid.

18
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:33,870
Cut off all rotten parts of the orchid stem.

19
00:02:36,347 --> 00:02:42,868
This will help prevent the orchid stem from rotting further.

20
00:03:20,894 --> 00:03:26,893
Then sprinkle cinnamon powder on the cut to help the wound heal quickly.

21
00:03:32,892 --> 00:03:38,890
Cinnamon powder has very good antibacterial and antiseptic properties.

22
00:03:57,043 --> 00:04:04,041
Then place in a cool place for 2 hours to let the cut dry completely.

23
00:04:09,448 --> 00:04:15,883
Take 1 clove of garlic and mince it.

24
00:04:18,882 --> 00:04:23,881
Garlic contains allicin, a substance with powerful antibacterial and antifungal effects

25
00:04:23,881 --> 00:04:28,881
helps prevent diseases and infections in orchids.

26
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:56,875
Add 500ml of water at room temperature.

27
00:04:59,874 --> 00:05:06,873
Cover and leave for 2 hours so that the garlic's nutrients are completely dissolved in the water.

28
00:05:09,872 --> 00:05:16,871
After 2 hours, filter out the residue to get garlic juice.

29
00:05:48,898 --> 00:05:55,897
After seeing that the cut has dried, soak the orchid roots in garlic water for 10 minutes. 🌸

30
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:12,893
This helps to disinfect the orchid, preventing rot while also stimulating its growth and quick recovery. 🌸

31
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:34,889
After soaking for 10 minutes, take the orchid out and plant it in a new pot to help it recover and grow faster. 🌸

32
00:06:41,887 --> 00:06:48,886
Use sterilized dry moss to grow plants.

33
00:06:52,733 --> 00:07:00,884
Dry moss will absorb moisture and help the cut heal completely.

34
00:07:02,883 --> 00:07:09,882
Then leave it in a cool place and do not water it for 1 week to let the cut heal completely.

35
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:20,880
This garlic water is used to water other orchids in the garden.

36
00:07:27,878 --> 00:07:31,878
Nutrients found in garlic such as calcium and potassium 

37
00:07:31,878 --> 00:07:38,876
and selenium helps stimulate the growth of orchid roots, helping the plant recover quickly.

38
00:07:52,873 --> 00:08:00,872
Do this every 2 weeks to increase the orchid's resistance and supplement nutrients for the orchid.

39
00:08:11,003 --> 00:08:18,868
Garlic also has the effect of repelling insects, so it helps protect plant leaves.

40
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:36,898
After 1 week, we start watering the orchids again.

41
00:09:35,886 --> 00:09:45,884
Then use recycled plastic bottles to create a miniature greenhouse to grow orchids.

42
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:58,882
Spray water every time the growing medium and orchid are dry.

43
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:13,879
Cover and place in a cool, well-lit place.

44
00:10:20,877 --> 00:10:26,876
Results after 1 month.

45
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:40,873
You can see a new baby orchid being revived from the trunk of an old dying orchid.

46
00:10:43,873 --> 00:10:50,871
New roots also grow a lot, which will help the baby orchids grow faster.

47
00:10:54,032 --> 00:11:00,869
From a bare orchid stem, an extremely healthy baby orchid has now been revived.

48
00:11:03,869 --> 00:11:10,867
When the root system is strong, we fertilize it to help the orchid grow faster.

49
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:25,898
Take 1/2 teaspoon of flour.

50
00:11:34,896 --> 00:11:39,895
Add 500ml of room temperature water (about 2 cups).

51
00:11:40,898 --> 00:11:47,896
Using wheat flour helps stimulate the growth of beneficial microorganisms in orchid pots, 

52
00:11:47,896 --> 00:11:54,895
Helps increase the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients.

53
00:11:56,205 --> 00:12:02,890
Wait 1 hour before using to fertilize orchids.

54
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:10,889
01 Hour later.

55
00:12:31,594 --> 00:12:36,884
Filter out residue.

56
00:12:52,881 --> 00:13:00,879
Then water this mixture every 2 weeks.

57
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:23,874
Continue to cover and place in a cool place with enough light.

58
00:13:29,873 --> 00:13:32,873
Results after 2 month.

59
00:13:36,872 --> 00:13:42,871
The baby orchids have grown and developed very healthily.

60
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,869
The root system grows very healthy.

61
00:13:55,868 --> 00:14:01,900
Leaves are green and sturdy.

62
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:20,896
Continue using fertilizer from wheat flour to water the orchids.

63
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:26,895
Wheat flour contains a lot of carbohydrates, 

64
00:14:26,895 --> 00:14:32,894
which serves as food for beneficial microorganisms in the soil or orchid growing medium. 

65
00:14:37,893 --> 00:14:42,892
These microorganisms help improve soil structure, 

66
00:14:42,892 --> 00:14:50,890
Enhances the ability to decompose organic substances, helping plants absorb nutrients better.

67
00:15:05,887 --> 00:15:10,886
Results after 3 month.

68
00:15:12,186 --> 00:15:20,885
The orchid has grown stronger and produced buds.

69
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:40,881
Growing roots help the orchid absorb nutrients best.

70
00:15:49,617 --> 00:15:55,878
The leaves are green and strong.

71
00:16:10,884 --> 00:16:18,873
This leaf has a rot disease so it must be removed immediately.

72
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:09,896
Continue to use wheat flour fertilizer to water the orchids every 2 weeks.

73
00:17:31,769 --> 00:17:36,891
Results after 4 month.

74
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:51,888
From the bare orchid stem, it has now revived and grown into a mature orchid.

75
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:06,885
The flowers bloom brightly and beautifully.

76
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:26,881
