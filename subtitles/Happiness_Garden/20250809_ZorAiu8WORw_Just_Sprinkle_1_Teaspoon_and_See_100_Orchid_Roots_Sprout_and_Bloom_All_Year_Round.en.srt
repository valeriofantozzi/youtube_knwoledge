bring you the simplest and most natural

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,800
choices to care for orchids at home. In

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,120
today's video, I will share new tips.

00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,599
These tips will help your orchids not

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,440

brilliantly everyday.

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,439
When the flowers wilt, you should cut

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,760
off the withered flower stems so the

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:28,279
orchid can focus nutrients on nourishing

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,279

40
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,000
To prepare fertilizer for orchids, I use

41
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,920
2 tablespoons of coffee powder in a cup.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,519
This is a simple but very effective

43
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,519
ingredient that helps the plant grow

44
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,519
healthier.

45
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,720
I add 500 ml of boiling water into the

46
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,480
cup to dissolve the coffee powder,

47
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,480
creating a nutrient solution for the

48
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,480
orchid.

50
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,519
After mixing, I let the solution rest

51
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,920
for about 2 hours before use so that the

52
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,550

53
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,810

55
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,400
Next, I take 2 tsp of dry yeast and put

56
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,000
it into another cup to prepare for the

57
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,260

66
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,560
After adding warm water, I tightly cover

67
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,280
the cup and let the yeast rest for about

68
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,479

fully activate to nourish the orchid.

70
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,919
Um, after 2 hours, when the water has

71
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,680
completely cooled, we filter out the

72
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,400

Um, when you spray this mixture on the

144
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,560
leaves and stems of the orchid, the

145
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,720
nutrients are quickly absorbed through

place it in a spot with gentle sunlight.

192
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,120
The soft light helps the plant absorb

193
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,560
nutrients better without causing stress

194
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,839
or leaf burn.

195
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,920
You should fertilize the orchid

196
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,839
regularly twice a month. This helps

197
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,760
provide continuous nutrients supporting

198
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,760
the plant to grow healthy and bloom more

199
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,760
beautifully.

200
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,639
And here is the result after 3 weeks of

201
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,560
care.

202
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,079
You can easily see many new roots have

203
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,740
started to grow, proving that the plant

204
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:32,320
is recovering and growing very well.

206
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,120
Um, you can see that the petals still

207
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,800
cling firmly to the stem. Not only not

208
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,880
wilted, but also maintaining their

209
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,880
bright and fresh colors for a long time.

210
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,519
The leaves become greener and firmer,

211
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,530
showing the plant's health and strong

212
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,040
growth.

214
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,200
Thick and healthy roots help the orchid

215
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,519
absorb nutrients from the soil to the

216
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,839
fullest, allowing the flowers to firmly

217
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:03,560
attach to the stem and produce many

218
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,560
healthier new buds.

220
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,560
Uh the root system plays a very

221
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,120
important role in the development of the

222
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,720
orchid. The plant's health largely

223
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,930
depends on how well the roots are cared

224
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:35,410
for and developed.

226
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,880
Uh when the orchid is provided with

227
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,120
enough nutrients, the flower stems will

228
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,720
continuously grow and sprout new buds,

229
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,720
bringing brilliant beauty to the plant.

230
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,680
These orchid pots are also cared for

231
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,079
with this special mixture. And you can

232
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,639
easily see their roots growing very

233
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,639
healthy and vibrant.

Not only the roots in the growing

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,519
medium, but also the orchid's aerial

237
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,680
roots grow strongly, contributing to

238
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:29,400
increased nutrient absorption and

239
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:32,520
maintaining the plant's vitality.

a solid foundation for the orchid to

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,000
grow healthy and resilient.

natural fertilizer and care for these
