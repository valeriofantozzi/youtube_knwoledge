00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,120
Orchids are famous for their lasting

beauty. Their blooms can open and stay

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,760
on the stem for a long time and with

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,080
proper care, the plant will continue to

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,080

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,080

Let's get started.

27
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,320
First of all, the placement of the

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,720
orchid pot plays a very important role.

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,880
A spot with gentle light and good air

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:15,080
circulation will help the plant absorb

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,080
nutrients better and grow healthily.

32
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,560
Orchids need light for photosynthesis,

33
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,080
but they can't tolerate harsh direct

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,920
sunlight.

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,640
The ideal spot is on a window sill with

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:30,840
a sheer curtain or under a light shade

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,840

you'll help your plant grow strong roots

43

44
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,360
All you need is 3 tablespoons of cooked

45

46
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,560

Method one, pour the solution into a

top and underside of the leaves as well

99
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,160
as the roots to help the plant absorb it

most effectively.

101
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,280
About 30 minutes after spraying, if

102
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,520
there's still water on the leaves,

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,880
gently blot the excess with a soft cloth

See you in the next video.

193
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,160
Welcome to my channel.

194
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,240
If you want your orchid to bloom

195
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,279
abundantly all year round, this is the

196
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,279
video I made just for you.

197
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,160
So, if you haven't subscribed to the

198
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,959
channel yet, make sure to do so to

on Tips 365.

201
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,480
It would be wonderful to have you

202
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:45,120
accompany me.

203
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:47,040
[Music]

204
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,120
When the orchid has finished blooming or

205
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,760
the plant is stunted, slow to grow and

206
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,760
has not yet bloomed.

207
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:58,929
[Music]

208
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,399
Cut all dry branches, roots, and leaves.

209
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,800
This helps orchids focus their energy on

210
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,800
healthy growth.

211
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,399
Removing dead parts helps prevent

212
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,240
disease, improves air circulation, and

213
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,480
encourages the growth of new roots and

214
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,110
leaves, resulting in stronger and more

215
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:35,120
vibrant blooms.

217
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,920

[Music]

219
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,640
Add four cups of boiled water. About one

220
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,640
liter of water.

221
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:17,789
Then brew until the water cools.

[Music]

223
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,399
After the water cools, filter to remove

224
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,399
sediment.

225
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,880
After the water cools, filter to remove

226
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,009
residue.

228
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,839
Please comment to me which country you

229
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,279
are watching the video from. It's great

230
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,500
that we can chat together from all over

231
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,560
the world.

[Music]

233
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,959
In addition to the English dub, we've

234
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:52,240
now created dubs in French, German,

235
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:54,079
Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese,

236
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:58,160
Hindi, and Indonesian to help you hear

237
00:12:54,079 --> 00:13:00,320
and understand the content more easily.

238
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:04,600
Then add one US gallon of water, about

239
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,600
3.8 L, to the mixture.

240
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:18,469
[Music]

241
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,370
First, use this water to thoroughly wipe

242
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:36,379
the top and bottom of the leaves.

243
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:36,379
[Music]

244
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,360
This clears dirt and removes fungus,

245
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,820
disease, and insects that damage the

246
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:50,320
leaves.

248
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:58,029
Apply this method once a month.

252
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,190
leaves stay green, strong, and resistant

to pests.

[Music]

255
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,639
Then you use this water to water the

256
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,639
orchid roots.

257
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,150
This helps roots grow healthily and

258
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:48,160
prevents root rot.

259
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:50,160
[Music]

260
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,960
Uh coffee contains many minerals

261
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:59,849
necessary for the growth of orchids.

[Music]

263
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,880
organic phosphorus and potassium found

264
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,970
in coffee help roots and flowers develop

265
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,070
outstandingly.

267
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,070
Do this twice a month for your orchids

268
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:34,660
so they grow and bloom profusely.

273
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,590
Or you can also use this water to spray

274
00:15:47,360 --> 00:16:01,450
the entire orchid.

277
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,160
Thoroughly spray the top and bottom of

278
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:17,800
the leaves to remove dirt and insects

279
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,800
from the leaf surface.

[Music]

283
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,079
Coffee water helps repel orchid pests

284
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,079
very effectively.

286
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,279
after spraying and soaking in this water

287
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:03,399
for about 5 minutes. The insects will

288
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,399
run away from the orchid pot.

289

290
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,439

Then take the orchid pot out and place

297
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:33,640
it in a cool place with enough light for

298
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,640
the orchid to grow.

299
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,320
