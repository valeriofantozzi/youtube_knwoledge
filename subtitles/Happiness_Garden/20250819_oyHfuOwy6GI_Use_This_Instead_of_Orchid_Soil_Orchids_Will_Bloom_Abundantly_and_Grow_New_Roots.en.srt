Welcome to the happiness garden, where

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,799
the simplest things are cared for with

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,880
all the love.

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,759
Today, I will share with you how to grow

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,759
orchids using the semihydroponic method.

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,170
A modern yet easy way to help the plant

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,960
grow healthily and bloom regularly.

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,400
This is an orchid that has finished

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,279
blooming, which I bought at a discount

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,720
from a local flower shop. I brought it

12
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,439
home to revive it using the

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,760
semihydroponic method, a growing

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,079
technique that helps the roots absorb

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,920
water and nutrients more efficiently,

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,160
thereby encouraging the plant to grow

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,160
back healthily.

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,480
Although the plant has wilted leaves and

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,480
no flowers, its inner potential is still

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,800
waiting to be awakened with gentle and

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,800
proper care.

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,280
First, you need to cut off the old

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,440
flower spike. Since the plant is showing

24
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,359
signs of leaf wilt, removing the spent

25
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,600
flower spike will help it save energy

26
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:07,510
and focus on nourishing the roots and

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,840
recovering its leaves more effectively.

28
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:11,520
[Music]

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,280
Next, you need to check the growing

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,600
medium.

31
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,439
If the medium still retains moisture,

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,040
but the leaves are wilted, it's very

33
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,439
likely that most of the orchid's roots

34
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,439
have been damaged.

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,840
As you can see, the growing medium is

36
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,159
too moist, and this makes the roots very

37
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,079
prone to rot. Uh, when roots are

38
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,840
submerged in an overly wet environment

39
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,240
for too long, they lack the oxygen

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,000
needed for respiration, leading to root

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,000
rot and weakening the plant.

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,759
Oh, there's a small worm crawling in the

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,399
growing medium. This shows that the

44
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,759
environment is so wet that even a worm

45
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:52,000
can live inside.

46
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,399
Although it's just a tiny creature, its

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,159
presence is a warning sign. The growing

48
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,000
medium is retaining too much moisture

49
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,240
and could harm the roots if not changed

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,240
in time.

51
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,710
We need to completely remove the old

52
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,860
growing medium.

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,200
rotted.

We only keep the healthy roots, those

that are white, green, or slightly ivory

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,519
After pruning, we need to rinse all the

81
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,239
remaining roots thoroughly under running

82
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,400
water. This helps remove dirt, old

83
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,120
medium debris, and any bacteria still

84
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,120
clinging to the roots.

85
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,920
Under the cool stream of water, the

86
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,439
roots are gently cleaned, ready for the

87
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,439
next step in the plant's recovery

88
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,439
process.

[Music]

90
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,359
The first ingredient I use to revive

91
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:23,759
this orchid is rice.

92
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,160
I put 3 teaspoon of rice into the

93
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,479
container. Rice is a great natural

94
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,120
source of nutrients that helps stimulate

95
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,960
root growth. When used properly, it can

96
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,720
be a simple yet effective solution to

97
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,800
support the orchid's recovery from

98
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,960
within.

99
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,800
The next ingredient I use is aloe vera

100
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,600
leaf.

101
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,120
Aloe vera has antibacterial properties,

102
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,960
soothes and stimulates cell

103
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,479
regeneration, making it excellent for

104
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,400
orchid root recovery.

105
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:55,360
I cut the aloe vera leaf into thin

106
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,000
slices.

107
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,240
These cool, fresh slices of aloe vera

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,360
will be a wonderful natural support for

109
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,360
the orchid after being damaged.

110
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,400
When combined with rice, aloe vera

111
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,840
creates a natural mixture that helps the

112
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,910
plant grow quickly and grow steadily

113
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,759

115
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:20,039
I put everything into about one liter of

116
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,039
room temperature water.

117
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,039
Water that is neither too cold nor too

118
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,520

119
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,800
the rice and aloe vera while creating an

120
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,840
ideal environment for the natural

121
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,840
ingredients to blend together.

122
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:43,560
I cover it and let it sit for 1 hour to

123
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,560
give the rice time to absorb the water.

help the nutrients from the rice and

127
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,880
aloe vera dissolve evenly in the water.

132
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,919
I press the rice and aloe vera pulp

133
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:42,800
firmly against the sieve to extract all

134
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,880
the nutrients into the mixture. Uh, this

135
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,639
is a simple yet effective way to make

136
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,120
the most of the nutrients in natural

137
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,919

138
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,319

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,319

142
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:34,840
After preparing the mixture, I soak the

143
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,840
orchid roots in it for about 20 minutes.

144
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,280
Uh this amount of time is enough for the

145
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,840
nutrients from the rice and aloe vera to

146
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,639
deeply penetrate the roots, helping to

147
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,639
soothe the damage and stimulate new root

148
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,639
growth.

149
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,599
While waiting for the roots to soak, you

150
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,000
can use a soft cloth dipped in the

151
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,160
solution to gently wipe the surface of

152
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,160
the leaves.

153
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,639
This not only helps clean off dust, but

154
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,120
also provides extra nutrients to the

155
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:10,560
leaves through the epidermis. The leaves

156
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,319
will become shinier, fresher, and will

157
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,879
contribute to the orchid's overall

158
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,879
recovery process.

159
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,960
In addition, wiping the leaves with this

160
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,120
natural solution also helps prevent the

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,680
adds a touch of elegance and softness to

193
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,680
the space.

194
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,120
Then I pour chlorine-free clean water

195
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:40,480
into the container to begin growing the

196
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,440

198
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,000
Chlorine-free water is safe for the

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,720
young roots, preventing root cell damage

200
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,959

201
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,959
more effectively.

202
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,160
The water level should only lightly

203
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,640
touch the bottom of the roots to create

204
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,320
a moderately humid environment, helping

205
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,720
the plant grow healthily without the

206
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,720
risk of rot.

207
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,240
I place the orchid pot in a spot with

208
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,800
gentle sunlight, good air circulation,

209
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,480
and away from direct harsh sun. Soft

210
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,600
light helps the plant photosynthesize

211
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,600
well without burning the leaves.

212
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,200
In addition, you should soak the orchid

213
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,839
roots in the natural fertilizer mixture

214
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,320
made from rice and aloe vera about once

215
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,320
every 2 weeks.

216
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,360
Each time you fertilize, be sure to

217
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,680
change the water in the container to

218
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,000
keep the environment clean, limit

219
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,320
bacterial growth, and create ideal

220
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,519
conditions for the roots to grow strong

221
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,519

229
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,399
This is a wonderful sign that the plant

230
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,290
is recovering well and absorbing

231
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,500

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,920
the strong vitality the orchid is

235
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,240

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,240

wilted leaves will gradually recover.

240
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,480
Because once the roots are healthy

241
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,720
again, the plant can absorb water and

242
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,920
nutrients more effectively, bringing the

253
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,720
