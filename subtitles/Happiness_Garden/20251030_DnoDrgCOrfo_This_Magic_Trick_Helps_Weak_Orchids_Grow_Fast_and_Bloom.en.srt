Welcome to the happiness garden where

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:09,040
every flower tells its own story.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,519
Here you can see an orchid that is

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,240
wilting. Perhaps it is because the plant

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,240
has not been watered properly or maybe

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,840
the direct sunlight has been too strong

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,400
on the plant causing the leaves to

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,480
weaken.

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,720
Um if you want the orchid to recover and

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,480
grow quickly, take some time to watch

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,920

And now I will share with you a truly

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,079
amazing trick.

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,640
You only need one aloe vera leaf. The

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,840
gel from this aloe vera leaf is truly

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,840
amazing for reviving an orchid.

[Music]

28
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,400
Now apply the aloe vera gel to both the

29
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,560
top and bottom surfaces of the leaf.

30
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,479
Aloe vera gel has excellent moisturizing

31
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,479
properties helping the orchid regain its

32
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,479
health.

33
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,360
In addition, aloe vera also contains

34
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,960
vitamins's A, B, C, and natural minerals

35
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,119
like nitrogen, phosphorus, and

36
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,000
potassium, which are very good for the

37
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,000
orchid's recovery process.

38
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,479
Do this every 5 days.

41
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,440
Then place the plant in a cool area for

42
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,440
3 weeks, allowing the leaf to fully

43
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,440
recover.

44
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:42,239
[Music]

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,120
Next, take one liter of warm water and

46
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,120
pour it into a container.

47
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:55,120
Next, soak one spoon of rice in the

48
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,800
water for about 30 minutes. During this

49
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,879
time, the nutrients in the rice will

50
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,720
gradually dissolve into the water,

51
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,519
creating a gentle yet energizing

52
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,519
solution for the orchid.

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,760
Uh the remaining aloe vera leaf will be

55
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,400
prepared to make a natural fertilizer

56
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,879
for the orchid. This is a great way to

57
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,360
make full use of the aloe leaf. Nothing

58
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,810
goes to waste and the plant absorbs even

59
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:45,440
more nutrients.

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:48,560
[Music]

61
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,280
Add about 300 ml of water. Then blend

62
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,360
the aloe vera thoroughly. When the aloe

63
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,519
is finely blended, its nutrients will

64
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,210
easily dissolve in the water, helping

65
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:15,169
the plant absorb them more effectively.

to get a smooth, clear aloe solution.

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,880
This liquid is a pure source of

70
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,230
nutrients that your orchid will

71
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:35,639
absolutely love.

75
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,880

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,160
After soaking for about 30 minutes,

80
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,919
strain out the clear rice water. This

81
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,840
part contains the most nutrients,

82
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,140
helping the orchid recover faster and

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:14,080

Then mix the rice water with the aloe

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,639
solution you just prepared. This

87
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,039

92
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,479
fertilizer, I place a bit of moss on the

93
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,720
surface of the pot. This moss layer

94
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,039
helps retain moisture for the roots and

95
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,060
allows the plant to absorb nutrients

96
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,940

108
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,639
Since the orchid is wilting, after

109
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,280
watering, you can soak the entire pot in

110
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,120
this mixture for about 2 hours. This

111
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,120
helps the roots fully absorb the

112
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,120

the orchid pot out and place it in a

116
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,199
cool, airy spot. This helps the orchid

117
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,710
relax, absorb nutrients better, and

118
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:25,899
begin its natural recovery process.

When you want to reuse the frozen liquid

130

Doing this helps the plant absorb

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,240
nutrients more easily and prevents

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,160
were once wilted have now fully

193
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,399
recovered, becoming firmer and healthier

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,480
These vibrant petals show that the

Every time you revive an orchid, you

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,720
experience a different joy, a truly

201
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,720
special feeling. The orchid not only

202
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,890
comes back to life, but also brings you

203
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,940
excitement and positive energy.

taking care of the plant, but also about

213
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,240

229
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,160
Welcome to part two of the video. In

230
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,880
this part, I will guide you through

231
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,440
simple yet effective steps to propagate

232
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,680
Phelinopsis at home, helping you expand

233
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,320
your orchid collection without much

234
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,800
effort. After the orchid has just

235
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,760
dropped all its petals, this is the best

236
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,839
time to propagate from the flower spike.

237
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,519
At this point, the mother plant has

238
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,440
completed its flowering process and is

239
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,440
ready for a new growth phase, helping

240
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,740
the offshoots grow healthy and

241
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:35,940
effectively.

squeeze out the juice. The garlic juice

245
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,480
will be used as a natural solution to

246
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,880

Next, use a cotton swab to dip into the

262
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,920
garlic juice and apply it directly onto

263
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,480
the node that needs stimulation to grow

264
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,399
an orchid offshoot. The garlic juice

265
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,519
will help provide antibacterial

266
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,440
protection, safeguard the spike, and

267
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,440
naturally stimulate the formation of new

268
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,440
shoots.

269
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,480
Only the nodes that have not yet bloomed

270
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,560
can sprout and grow into orchid

271
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,279
offshoots. So, you should apply the

272
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,839
garlic juice only to the young unopened

273
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,600
nodes. This ensures that the new shoots

274
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,110
will grow healthy and easily develop

275
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,570

277
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,639
Then use a transparent plastic wrap to

278
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,040
cover the part of the flower spike where

279
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,519
the node you want to stimulate into an

280
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,839
orchid offshoot is located. This helps

281
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,240
retain moisture, protect the young chute

282
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,079
from insects and bacteria, and create an

283
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,079
ideal environment for the offshoot to

284
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,079
develop.

285
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,560
Make a small hole for ventilation,

286
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,800
allowing the chute to receive enough

287
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,959
oxygen and preventing moisture that can

288
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,880
cause rot or fungus.

289
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:34,620

295
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,000
You can see that the spot where the

296
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,720
garlic juice was applied has formed a

297
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,720
very healthy orchid offshoot. However,

298
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,680
at this stage, the offshoot has not yet

299
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,839
developed visible leaves or roots. This

300
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,160
is an early sign that the new chute is

301
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,230
beginning to grow and is ready for the

302
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:18,000

grown very healthily on the flower spike

young roots forming.

311
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,920
the new chute is ready to develop into

312
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,920
an independent plant in the future.

Note, throughout the process of

314
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,839
stimulating the node to grow into an

315
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,880
orchid offshoot, place the orchid pot in

316
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,880
a shaded area with high humidity as this

317
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,480
helps the young shoot form and develop

easily.

319
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,880
Conversely, if the orchid pot is placed

320
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,880
in a sunny area with low humidity, the

321
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,140
plant is more likely to produce flowers

322
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,600
instead of an offshoot.

result is that many healthy orchid

327

offshoots have formed on the flower

328

spike.

329
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,880
This simple yet effective method helps
