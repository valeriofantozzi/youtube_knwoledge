Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:16,897 --> 00:00:26,895
In this video, I share how to make orchids bloom at the same time with many flower branches.

3
00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:36,893
Conditions for orchids to bloom require 3 to 5 pairs of leaves or more and healthy roots.

4
00:00:38,893 --> 00:00:50,890
Only a healthy root system can absorb enough nutrients so the orchid can bloom many flowers at the same time.

5
00:01:04,888 --> 00:01:12,886
First you need a small ginger root.

6
00:01:19,885 --> 00:01:25,883
Wash.

7
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:50,879
then slice thinly.

8
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:21,872
Then soak in 500ml of hot water and wait for it to cool before using.

9
00:02:29,871 --> 00:02:39,869
Then take 3 more spoons of rice.

10
00:02:44,113 --> 00:02:50,900
Add 1 liter of water.

11
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:10,896
Then filter this rice water.

12
00:03:15,053 --> 00:03:23,893
Mix the two types together.

13
00:03:30,213 --> 00:03:36,891
Clean the leaves with this water.

14
00:03:39,091 --> 00:03:49,888
Helps eliminate fungi and bacteria to help orchids grow better.

15
00:04:12,384 --> 00:04:22,882
Dip a cotton ball in this water.

16
00:04:30,266 --> 00:04:40,878
Then place it between two leaves, where the flower stem can grow..

17
00:04:53,786 --> 00:04:59,874
Then use this water to water the orchid roots.

18
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:11,872
This will help stimulate root growth and flower stem growth..

19
00:05:15,538 --> 00:05:21,870
Do it once a week.

20
00:05:24,034 --> 00:05:30,868
Soak in this water for about 30 minutes each time so that the roots can absorb many substances.

21
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:38,900
then take it out.

22
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:50,898
Change the cotton once a week.

23
00:05:54,283 --> 00:06:02,895
And you only need to do it 3 times.

24
00:06:11,894 --> 00:06:19,892
On weekdays, you just need to spray mist to moisturize with water.

25
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:30,890
2 Months Later.

26
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:42,887
You see my orchid has grown many flower branches at the same time.

27
00:06:51,886 --> 00:07:02,883
New roots also grow and old roots become stronger.

28
00:07:14,092 --> 00:07:18,880
With this simple method, 

29
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:26,879
we can completely stimulate orchids to produce many flower branches at the same time.

30
00:07:34,635 --> 00:07:44,875
To do this, you need to pay attention to choosing healthy orchids with many pairs of leaves to fertilize..

31
00:07:48,913 --> 00:07:58,872
Only then will the orchid have enough nutrients to grow many flower branches at the same time.
