To help you have many choices when caring for orchids at home with organic fertilizer.

3
00:00:15,897 --> 00:00:21,629
In this video, I continue to share new methods.

5
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:46,958
To make this compost you need eggs.

6
00:00:55,889 --> 00:01:11,886
To be more precise, it takes about 10 eggshells.

7
00:01:15,885 --> 00:01:25,883
Then rinse with water to remove the gel in the eggshell.

8
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:56,877
then dry in the sun

9
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:16,873
After drying for about 3 hours in the autumn sun, the eggshell was completely dry.

10
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:56,899
Grind into dry powder.

11
00:03:09,896 --> 00:03:19,894
Take 1 teaspoon of eggshell powder.

12
00:03:23,893 --> 00:03:33,891
Add one liter of boiled water.

13
00:03:50,888 --> 00:03:59,886
then brew until the water cools.

14
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:22,882
After cooling, filter to remove residue.

15
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:39,878
FIRST METHOD.

16
00:04:45,877 --> 00:04:55,875
Wipe the top and bottom of the leaves with eggshell water.

17
00:05:01,874 --> 00:05:11,872
Eggshells contain a lot of calcium, an important mineral for plant growth.

18
00:05:15,871 --> 00:05:25,869
Helps leaves become stronger than usual.

19
00:05:30,868 --> 00:05:40,900
This method helps kill fungi and insects very well.

20
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:06,228
SECOND METHOD.

21
00:06:18,892 --> 00:06:28,890
Spray eggshell water on the entire orchid.

22
00:06:40,888 --> 00:06:50,886
Calcium in eggshells helps strengthen plant structures very well,

23
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:06,883
especially creating strong branches and leaves.

24
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,879
THIRD METHOD.

25
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:35,877
Apply liquid fertilizer from eggshells to orchid roots.

26
00:07:41,876 --> 00:07:51,874
Calcium from eggshell water helps enhance orchid root growth,

27
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:10,870
Helps plants absorb nutrients from the growing medium better.

28
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:32,899
Calcium also helps orchids increase disease resistance,

29
00:08:36,898 --> 00:08:46,896
making them less susceptible to infection and disease.

30
00:09:06,892 --> 00:09:10,891
FOURTH METHOD.

31
00:09:12,891 --> 00:09:22,889
Sprinkle eggshell powder on the surface of the orchid pot.

32
00:09:26,888 --> 00:09:36,886
Calcium helps orchids absorb water better.

33
00:09:36,886 --> 00:09:46,884
This makes the plant more resistant to water depletion.

34
00:09:48,884 --> 00:09:52,883
RESULT.

35
00:09:57,882 --> 00:10:07,880
After 1 month of application, the orchids developed many new roots.

36
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:22,944
This helps orchids best absorb nutrients for outstanding growth.

37
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:42,873
Flowers bloom hard and last long.

38
00:10:46,872 --> 00:10:56,870
Many flowers bloom at the same time without exhausting the orchids.

39
00:11:02,869 --> 00:11:10,868
