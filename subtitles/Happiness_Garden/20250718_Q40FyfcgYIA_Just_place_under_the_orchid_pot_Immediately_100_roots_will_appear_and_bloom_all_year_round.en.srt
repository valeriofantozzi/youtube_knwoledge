Welcome to my little garden full of

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,839
love, where orchid petals bloom in

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,559
vibrant colors and every moment of

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:12,120
caring for the plants is a simple yet

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,120
profound joy.

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,000
Today I'm back with a new natural

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,920
fertilizer recipe. Simple, easy to make,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,680
but very effective to continue the

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,400
journey of caring for beautiful orchid

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,400

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,920
with me.

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,200
Let's get started.

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,360
This is an orchid that has just finished

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,840
blooming after a long and glorious

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,520
journey. For the past 6 months, it has

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,600
used up all its nutrients to keep

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,000
blooming continuously, bringing

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,480
incredible beauty. That's why the leaves

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,480
are starting to wilt as a sign that the

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,250
plant needs to recover and be nourished

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,560
again from the roots.

[Music]

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,880
First, gently cut off the old flower

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,880
spike, the part of the plant that has

29
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,880
completed its blooming mission to help

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,040
the orchid focus on nourishing new roots

31
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,040
and leaves.

32
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,960
Next, remove the dry leaves. They no

33
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,400
longer nourish the plant and may cause

34
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:34,790
disease if left in place.

36
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,960
The pine bark growing medium is still

37
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,720
dry, airy, and relatively new, so

38
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,320
there's no need to replace it for now.

39
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,320
The plant can still grow well in this

40
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,320
environment.

42
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,439
I'll add a layer of moss on the surface

43
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,000
of the orchid pot to improve moisture

44
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:04,600

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,600
currently quite dry and drains quickly.

47
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,280
The moss needs to be properly treated to

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,840
remove fungi and dried before placing it

49
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:20,170
on the pot to ensure the orchid safety

50
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:26,080

A thick layer of moss covering the pot's

Uh to make today's natural fertilizer,

74
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,319
I'll use garlic, a familiar ingredient

75
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,760
that's very effective in stimulating

76
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:41,440

Take one clove of garlic, gently peel

it, then cut it into a few slices and

80
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,120
place them in a container, ready for the

81
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,120

86
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,160

89
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,520
The next ingredient I need is molasses.

90
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,600
A great source of nutrients that feeds

91
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,919
beneficial microbes and supports healthy

twice a month to keep your orchids

193
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,200
healthy and blooming regularly.

194
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,200
After soaking for about 10 minutes,

195
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,200
gently wipe off any remaining liquid

196
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,959
fertilizer on the leaves and leaf axles

197
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,720
with a soft cloth to keep the orchid

198
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,720
leaves fresh and prevent prolonged

199
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,720
dampness.

200
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,240
While wiping, you also remove dust,

201
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,320
fungi, and insects still clinging to the

202
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,959
leaves, helping the orchid leaves stay

203
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,959
clean and healthier.

204
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:50,160
[Music]

205
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,160
Then uh take the orchid pot out and

206
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,480
place it in a well ventilated area with

207
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:58,839
gentle sunlight to help the plant rec

208
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,839
recover quickly and grow better.

210
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,079
Remember, no matter how good the

211
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,160
fertilizer is, if the plant lacks

212
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:09,850
sunlight, it will struggle to grow

213
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:15,570
healthy and bloom regularly.

214
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:15,570

215
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,720
And here's the result after 1 month of

216
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,560
care. You can see the orchid leaves have

217
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,720
become much greener and shinier compared

218
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,720
to before.

220
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,680
Now let's check the orchid roots to see

221
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,050
how they are doing after the care

222
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:52,659

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,600
You can see the new roots growing very

226
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,760
strong, proving that the plant is

227
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,760
recovering well and absorbing nutrients

228
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,760
effectively.

229
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,200
These healthy thick new roots will help

230
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,800
the plant absorb water and nutrients

231
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,460
efficiently, thereby restoring the

232
00:13:38,800 --> 00:14:04,730
wilting leaves.

234
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,240
Now I will replant the orchid into the

235
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,240
pot, then continue caring for and

236
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,450
fertilizing it to help the plant grow

237
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,570
stronger.

240
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,360
Then I continue caring for the orchid

241
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,760
with the lightly fermented fertilizer

242
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,519
made from garlic. Garlic and molasses,

243
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,839
helping the plant recover quickly and

244
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,839
grow sustainably.

248
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,399
Uh you should water this fertilizer

249
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,000
mixture two to three times a month to

250
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,740
keep your orchids healthy and blooming

251
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:07,990

253
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,320
Or you can also spray this fertilizer

254
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,920
mixture onto the orchid to provide

255
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,920
nutrients directly to the leaves and

256
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,920
stem.

257
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,519
Additionally, you can alternate using

258
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,560
this mixture with other natural

259
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,639
fertilizers to diversify nutrients and

260
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,519
provide more comprehensive care for your

261
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,519
orchids.

262
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,480
After watering, you can soak the orchid

263
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,800
pot in the mixture for about 10 to 20

264
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,720
minutes to allow nutrients to deeply

265
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,040
penetrate the roots, helping the plant

266
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,040
recover faster.

268
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,959
Then take the orchid pot out and place

269
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,120
it in a spot with gentle sunlight to

270
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:02,120
help the plant absorb light and grow

271
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,120
better.

272
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,959
And here is the result after 3 months.

273
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,799
You can see the orchid has fully

274
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,390
recovered and started to sprout two

275
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:19,120

277
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,679

The leaves near the base are still

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,600
wilted, but the leaves above have fully

282
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,559
recovered and many fresh green leaves

283
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,880
are growing at the top. This shows the

284
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,330

285
00:17:38,880 --> 00:18:01,280
