00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:37,000
this is the Orchid after

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,760
blooming first you need to cut off

16
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,760
damaged leaves and

17
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,239
Roots first you need to cut off damaged

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,039
leaves and Roots after the flowers fade

19
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:59,840
the orchid needs time to recover and

20
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,840
store energy for the next blooming cycle

21
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:07,640
without proper care the plant may not

22
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,640
have enough energy to develop new flower
