Hello everyone. Welcome to the happiness

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,279
garden channel. Today I will share a

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,800
great tip for taking care of orchids

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,559
after the flowers have faded.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,719
This method is especially effective in

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,320
helping wilted or weak orchids recover

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,399
and grow quickly.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,320
Um many people after buying orchids

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,920
often don't know how to take care of

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,920
them once the flowers have fully

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,920
bloomed.

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,120
Some let the plant wither while others

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,399
throw it away thinking it no longer has

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,960
any value.

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,800
But in fact, this is the time when the

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,200
plant needs to recover in preparation

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,680
for the next blooming cycle. If cared

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,680
for properly, it will continue to grow

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,680
and may even bloom more beautifully than

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,680
before.

22
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,840
The first thing you need to do is check

23
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,840
the roots. When the leaves are wilted,

24
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,159
it's often because the roots are damaged

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:08,360
and can no longer absorb water or

26
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,360
nutrients from the growing medium.

27
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,600
When the roots lose their function, the

28
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,560
plant will gradually weaken, the leaves

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,479
will wrinkle, and it will lose vitality.

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,759
Checking and properly treating the roots

31
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,759
will help the plant recover quickly.

[Music]

33
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,119
If you find that the roots are rotten,

34
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,200
soft, or dry and brittle, you need to

35
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:37,119
gently cut off those damaged parts.

36
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,759
Removing the damaged roots helps prevent

37
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,920
the spread of fungal diseases and

38
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,640
creates conditions for the plant to grow

39
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,479
stronger new roots.

You can see that this orchid has many

53
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,410
damaged roots which is the reason why

54
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:32,940
the leaves are wilted and wrinkled.

56
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,560
Next, cut off the faded flower spike.

57
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,239
After blooming, the flower spike no

58
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,319
longer provides nutrients to the plant

59
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,730
and may even drain additional energy to

60
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:58,800
maintain.

After cutting off the damaged roots and

63
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,680
faded flower spike, you should rinse the

64
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,680
entire plant with water.

65
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,200
Use clean water that is not too cold and

66
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,519
be gentle to avoid damaging the

67
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,519
remaining roots.

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,080
This helps remove dirt, bacteria, or

70
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:25,560
fungi that may still be clinging to the

71
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,560
roots and stem.

72
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,440
Uh after rinsing, you need to let the

73
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,360
orchid dry before proceeding to the next

74
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:56,169
steps.

[Music]

76
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,360
To revive a wilted orchid, I use a fresh

77
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,519
aloe vera leaf.

78
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,840
Aloe vera has natural antibacterial

79
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,480
properties and provides moisture and

80
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,480
nutrients that stimulate root growth. It

81
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,480
is a simple yet highly effective

82
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,090
ingredient for helping the plant recover

83
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:20,000
quickly.

[Music]

85
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
After cutting the aloe vera leaf into a

86
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,000
container, add 500 ml of water.

87
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:38,739
[Music]

88
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,280
Then blend it well to help the nutrients

89
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,520
in the aloe vera dissolve evenly into

90
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,479
the water, uh, creating a natural

91
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,479
solution to revive the orchid.

[Music]

93
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,400
After blending, I use a strainer to

94
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,840
remove the residue, keeping only the

95
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,520
clear aloe vera water.

96
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,919
Careful straining will keep the solution

97
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,680
from becoming too thick, allowing it to

98
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,360
absorb easily into the roots and

99
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,540
preventing clogging of the growing

100
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:34,949
medium when used on the plant.

103
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,800
Then I soak the wilted leaves of the

104
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,440
plant in the aloe vera solution for

105
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,440
about 20 minutes.

soothe the dehydrated leaves, and help

109
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,080
the plant absorb nutrients more quickly,

110
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,840
thereby promoting the natural recovery

111
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:13,600

The next ingredient I use is a small

118
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,440
amount of molasses.

119
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,520
Although simple, molasses contains many

120
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,000
minerals and natural sugars that

121
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,440
stimulate beneficial microorganisms and

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,040
help the orchid recover faster when

123
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,360
combined with aloe vera.

[Music]

125
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,520
uh you only need to add about a/

126
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,440
teaspoon of molasses. This small amount

127
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,599
provides enough nutrients to support

128
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,000
root recovery without causing the

129
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:05,000
solution to ferment or or harm the

130
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000

143
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:01,120
The next ingredient I use is vitamin B1.

144
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,919
It is an excellent supplement that helps

145
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,639
stimulate new root growth, reduces shock

146
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,760
after root trimming, and accelerates the

147
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:16,479
recovery process.

solution with each tablet containing 2.5

151
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,960
mg. This small amount is enough to

152
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,720
support new root growth and enhance

153
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,990
nutrient absorption without harming the

154
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,879

water other orchid pots in the garden.

163
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,360
Um, the mixture of aloe vera, molasses,

164
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,360
and vitamin B1 can naturally stimulate

165
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,040
new root growth. When the roots are

166
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,839
properly nourished, the orchid will

167
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,839
quickly grow stronger.

172
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,880
recover a bit more slowly at first, but

173
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,959
after a short time, the roots will grow

174
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,720
strong, the leaves will become glossy

175
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,200
green again, and the plant will start

176
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,600

177
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,600

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,640
In addition to supporting the roots,

194
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,920
this solution also helps the leaves

195
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,440
become greener, thicker, and glossier.

196
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,079
This is a sign that the plant is

197
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,690
absorbing nutrients well and is full of

198
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,879
vitality.

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,240
In particular, the vitamin B1 in the

201
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,560
mixture plays an important role in

202
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,279
reducing plant shock, especially after

203
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,279
root trimming or repotting.

204
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,440
You can see that many new roots are

205
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,000
growing, which shows that the plant is

206
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,000
recovering well and absorbing nutrients

207
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
effectively.

208
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,519
When the roots grow strongly, the plant

209
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,000
will have a solid foundation to nourish

210
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:38,090
its leaves, develop its stem, and

211
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,210
prepare for the next blooming phase.

After soaking the roots in the solution

215
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,310
for about 20 minutes, gently take the

216
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,279

218
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,680
Then use a soft cloth to absorb any

219
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:06,040
remaining water on the leaf surface and

220
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,040
in the crevices between the leaves.

221
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,720
This helps prevent moisture buildup that

222
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,800
could cause leaf rot or fungal diseases

223
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,370

226
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,639

229
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:41,959
I choose crushed pine bark as the

230
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,959
growing medium to repot the orchid.

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,079
gently add the crushed pine bark around

234
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,079
the base.

235
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,839
Handle with great care to avoid damaging

236
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,760
the new roots while ensuring the roots

237
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,320
are gently embraced by the growing

238
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:17,800

241
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,639
Finally, I place a small amount of moss

242
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,639
on the surface of the pot.

243
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,320
Uh, this layer of moss helps retain

244
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,079
moisture around the base, creating a

245
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,519
cooler and more stable environment for

246
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,519

After

251
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,279
repotting, you can use the remaining

252
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,120
natural fertilizer mixture that was used

253
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,440
for soaking the roots to water the newly

254
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,440
potted orchid.

255
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,639
This helps provide additional nutrients

256
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,519
to the growing medium, supporting the

257
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:49,160
roots to adapt quickly and grow strong

259
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,160
For the cut on the spike, you can

260
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,199
lightly sprinkle a bit of cinnamon

261
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,560
powder on it.

262
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,320
Cinnamon powder has natural

263
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,399
antibacterial properties that help

264
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,959
prevent fungal infections and dry the

265
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:10,560
cut faster, thereby protecting the plant

266
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:12,240
during the recovery phase.

267
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,480
After that, you should place the orchid

268
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,720
pot in a cool, wellventilated area with

269
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,639
gentle sunlight.

270
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,720
Soft light allows the plant to

photosynthesize gently without losing

272
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,040
moisture too quickly, creating ideal

273
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,040
conditions for new roots to begin

Um, you can see that the leaves are less

278
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,720
wilted compared to the beginning. This

279
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,560

302
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,080
allowing the roots to grow strong, the

leaves to stay healthy and green, and

304
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,520

the orchid doesn't receive enough light,

309
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,240
it still won't grow well. Light is an

310
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,200
important factor that helps the plant
