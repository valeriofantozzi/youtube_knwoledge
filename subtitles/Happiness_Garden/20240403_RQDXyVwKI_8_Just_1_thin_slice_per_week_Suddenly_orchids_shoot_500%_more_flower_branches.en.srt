In this video, I continue to share how to make orchids bloom at the same time with many flower branches.

3
00:00:20,257 --> 00:00:29,895
Orchids after flowers fade.

4
00:00:32,346 --> 00:00:40,892
We cut off all the spent flower stems.

5
00:00:46,663 --> 00:00:56,889
If the plant has never bloomed, it must have 3 or more pairs of leaves.

6
00:00:56,889 --> 00:01:00,655
and healthy roots.

7
00:01:00,655 --> 00:01:07,387

9
00:01:13,686 --> 00:01:23,884
Sprinkle cinnamon powder on the wound to help it heal quickly.

10
00:01:31,882 --> 00:01:39,881
Then wait 1 day for the cut to dry.

11
00:01:50,526 --> 00:02:00,877
Then take 1/2 small onion and cut it into thin slices.

12
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:28,871
 
Add 1 liter of water and bring to a boil.

13
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:36,869
Wait a day then use.

14
00:02:44,868 --> 00:02:54,899
Next take 3 spoons of rice.

15
00:02:56,339 --> 00:03:06,897
Then soak in 1 liter of water and leave for 1 day before using.

16
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:32,892
After a day, filter out the residue.

17
00:03:49,552 --> 00:03:59,886
Mix the two types together.

18
00:04:07,336 --> 00:04:15,883
Clean the leaves with this water.

19
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:28,881
Helps eliminate fungi and bacteria to help orchids grow better.

20
00:04:28,881 --> 00:04:34,879
Do it once a week.

21
00:04:40,198 --> 00:04:50,876
Then use this water to water the orchid roots.

22
00:04:57,295 --> 00:05:06,873
This will help stimulate root and flower stem growth.

23
00:05:09,012 --> 00:05:15,890
Do it once a week.

24
00:05:24,403 --> 00:05:34,868
Place cotton balls between 2 leaves.

25
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:09,894
Then spray this water on the cotton pad.

26
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:18,892
This stimulates flower stems to grow.

27
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:31,890
and spray on the top and bottom of the leaves to help supplement nutrients through the leaves for the orchids.

28
00:06:33,956 --> 00:06:42,954
This should be done early in the morning, so that by noon the leaves will dry before the sun shines.

29
00:06:44,711 --> 00:06:54,885
After 30 minutes, remove the cotton and repeat once a week.

30
00:06:57,631 --> 00:07:06,883
and take out the orchid pot.

31
00:07:14,748 --> 00:07:17,880
2 Months Later.

32
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:28,878
Many flower stems grow at the same time.

33
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:46,875
Orchids also grow many new roots.

34
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:57,873
With this simple method, you can easily care for blooming orchids at home.

35
00:08:00,412 --> 00:08:05,871
Tips for recovering rot-infected orchids

36
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:39,631
When orchids are old and have poor resistance, we need to rejuvenate them.

37
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:58,627
First you need to cut off all damaged leaves and roots.

38
00:09:53,616 --> 00:09:58,615
Keep only fresh roots.

39
00:10:10,613 --> 00:10:20,611
Onions have very good antiseptic and growth stimulating effects

40
00:10:50,605 --> 00:11:00,603
Take about 20 grams of thinly sliced ​​onion.

41
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:13,600
Take 1 teaspoon of baking soda.

42
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:20,599
Helps balance PH levels and eliminate fungal diseases harmful to orchids.

43
00:11:23,598 --> 00:11:33,596
Add 2 liters of water at room temperature.

44
00:11:40,595 --> 00:11:45,594
Wait 30 minutes before using.

45
00:11:52,593 --> 00:12:02,591
After 30 minutes, filter to remove residue.

46
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:41,583
Then water the orchid with onion water and baking soda.

47
00:13:13,577 --> 00:13:23,575
Soak in this water for 30 minutes.

48
00:13:54,569 --> 00:14:04,600
Cover the pot with a layer of dry moss.

49
00:14:19,597 --> 00:14:29,595
Place the dried moss in this transparent plastic box.

50
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:52,590
Leave in a cool place for 1 day without watering.

51
00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:01,589
1 Day Later.

52
00:15:03,588 --> 00:15:13,586
From now on, water your orchids once a week.

53
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:25,884
Or water when the moss is dry.

54
00:15:32,882 --> 00:15:42,880
Be careful to keep the moss moist. If the moss is waterlogged, the orchid will easily rot.

55
00:15:52,878 --> 00:16:02,876
Then place it in a cool place with enough light for the orchid to grow.

56
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:16,874
3 Weejs Later.

57
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:06,897
Many baby orchids have sprouted.

58
00:17:25,893 --> 00:17:30,892
Take 2 liters of water at room temperature.

59
00:17:34,892 --> 00:17:44,890
Then add 5 spoons of rice.

60
00:18:03,886 --> 00:18:13,884
Water the orchid with rice water once a week.

61
00:18:15,883 --> 00:18:25,881
Helps stimulate baby orchids to grow and take root quickly.

62
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:42,878
Continue to place in a cool, well-lit place for the orchid to grow

63
00:18:52,876 --> 00:18:56,875
After the next 1 month

64
00:19:03,874 --> 00:19:13,872
The baby orchids grow very healthy.

65
00:19:18,871 --> 00:19:28,869

75
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:45,875
I cut the peel of an orange and put it in a jar.

76
00:21:49,874 --> 00:21:58,873
Add 2 liters of warm water.

77
00:21:59,872 --> 00:22:09,870
Then add 1 spoon of sugar and 1 spoon of yeast.

78
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:38,898
Punch holes in the lid, close the lid and leave in a cool place for 1 month.

79
00:22:51,895 --> 00:22:55,895
1 MONTH LATER.

80
00:23:00,894 --> 00:23:10,892
I already have GE orange peel fertilizer.

81
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:22,889
I took 4 tablespoons of GE orange peel.

82
00:23:34,887 --> 00:23:41,886
mix 2 liters of water.

83
00:23:43,885 --> 00:23:47,884
FIRST METHOD.

84
00:23:49,884 --> 00:23:59,882
Use a GE orange peel to thoroughly wipe the top and bottom of the leaf.

85
00:24:02,881 --> 00:24:12,879
Orange peels contain essential oils that after incubation will help repel insects very effectively

86
00:24:24,877 --> 00:24:34,875
Helps leaves photosynthesize and create chlorophyll better.

87
00:24:40,874 --> 00:24:50,872
Do this 1-2 times a month to protect orchids and keep the leaves green.

88
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:02,870
SECOND METHOD.

89
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:16,900
Applying this fertilizer to the roots 1-2 times per month helps provide organic substances such as:

90
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:26,898
humic acid, fulvic acid and enhance water retention in orchid growing media.

91
00:25:35,896 --> 00:25:45,894
Orange peel also contains many important minerals such as potassium, magnesium, calcium and trace elements.

92
00:25:51,893 --> 00:26:01,891
GE fertilizer helps orchids grow strongly and increase flower production.

93
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:16,888
GE fertilizer helps improve the ability of plants to absorb nutrients, 

94
00:26:16,888 --> 00:26:26,886
helping orchids make better use of available nutrients in the environment.

95
00:26:36,884 --> 00:26:40,883
Let's see the results.

96
00:26:43,883 --> 00:26:53,881
The flower color is more vibrant than usual.

97
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:11,877
Orchids bloom many flowers on the same tree but do not fall.

98
00:27:15,876 --> 00:27:26,874
Flowers bloom continuously from season to season all year round. 
 

99
00:27:32,873 --> 00:27:42,871
The flowers stay on the branches for a long time before fading.
