00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:12,898
In this video, I share how to fertilize to help flower branches continue to revive and bloom after the flowers wither.

4
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:35,893
When eating bananas, don't throw away the peel.

5
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:46,891
Because banana peels contain a lot of potassium and important nutrients that are very good for plant growth.

6
00:00:56,354 --> 00:01:06,887
I took a banana peel and cut it into thin slices.

7
00:01:09,887 --> 00:01:16,885
then put it in a jar.

8
00:01:22,884 --> 00:01:32,882
Then take 3 tablespoons of soybeans and put them in a jar.

9
00:01:42,047 --> 00:01:48,879
Add 1 teaspoon of sugar.

10
00:01:50,576 --> 00:01:58,877
and add 1 teaspoon yeast.

11
00:02:02,876 --> 00:02:12,874
Then pour in 500ml of warm water.

12
00:02:14,874 --> 00:02:24,872
Leave in a cool place for 1 month before using.

13
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:42,868
This is an orchid after blooming and fading.

14
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:15,895
I cut off all the dry branches.

15
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:56,887
These nodes may continue to bloom.

16
00:04:10,048 --> 00:04:18,883
The top of the orchid has rotted.

17
00:04:20,882 --> 00:04:30,880
The leaves also rot.

18
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:42,878
Cut off rotten leaves

19
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:56,875
Then sprinkle cinnamon powder on top to help the cut heal quickly and prevent rot.

20
00:05:07,251 --> 00:05:16,871
and sprinkle it on the rotting tops.

21
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:24,869
Leave for 1 day without watering until the cut heals

22
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:31,127
1 DAY LATER.

23
00:05:31,127 --> 00:05:39,900
Watering keeps the roots green.

24
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:52,897
This will help the roots absorb nutrients better when we fertilize the orchids.

25
00:06:03,607 --> 00:06:13,893
Soak the orchid pot in water for about 20 minutes then take it out.

26
00:06:24,024 --> 00:06:33,889
This is soybean water and banana peel fermented after 1 month.

27
00:06:35,148 --> 00:06:45,887
Take 50ml.

28
00:06:50,886 --> 00:07:00,884
Mix with 2 liters of water.

29
00:07:06,883 --> 00:07:16,881
Cleaning leaves helps protect them from disease.

30
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:32,877
The pH of this water helps eliminate fungi and insects, so it protects orchids very well.

31
00:07:56,206 --> 00:08:04,871
Spray this water on the leaves once a week.

32
00:08:06,871 --> 00:08:12,870
will supplement nutrients through the leaves to help the leaves stay green.

33
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:22,868
And spray this water on the branches once a week to help stimulate flowering.

34
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:39,898
And I water this once a week to stimulate the growth of roots, stems, leaves and flowers.

35
00:08:40,897 --> 00:08:49,896
Because the roots are the best part of the plant that absorbs nutrients.

36
00:08:53,082 --> 00:09:03,893
and can be soaked for about 20 minutes and then taken out.

37
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:13,891
1 Month Later.

38
00:09:19,538 --> 00:09:28,888
Many flower buds have sprouted from withered orchid branches.

39
00:09:36,237 --> 00:09:46,884
This simple method will help your orchids bloom many times a year.

40
00:09:52,861 --> 00:10:02,881
Even rotten orchids like mine still bloom several times a year.

41
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:18,878
