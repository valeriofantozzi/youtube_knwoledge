00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,880
Welcome to the little garden where

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:07,520
wonders begin from a leaf, a flower, or

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,120
a moment of listening to nature.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,759
Today, I want to share with you a

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,679
special way to grow orchids. No need for

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,360
frequent watering, yet the plant stays

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,360
healthy and blooms brilliantly to your

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,360
amazement.

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,640
These are two orchid plants that

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,519
probably haven't bloomed for a long time

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,279
and were thrown away. I picked them up

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,240
hoping to revive the beauty they once

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,320
had.

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,480
The first thing I need to do is gently

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,800
take the plant out of the pot and remove

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,280
all the old growing medium to begin the

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,280
recovery process.

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,320
Next, I gently trim off the damaged

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,640
leaves and the old dried flower spike to

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,600
purify the plant, making it lighter and

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,600
ready for a fresh new start.

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,559
I continue trimming off the rotten roots

23
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,720
to keep only the healthy parts, helping

24
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,720
the plant recover more easily and grow

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,720
better.

[Music]

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,320
After that, I rinse the entire orchid

28
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,400
under running water to completely remove

29
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,390
the old growing medium and clean the

30
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:44,270
plant before repotting.

[Music]

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,000
After rinsing, I let the plant rest for

33
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,880
a while to dry completely before

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,880
repotting.

35
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,000
To help the plant recover during

36
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,680
repotting, I use rice as a natural

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,159
fertilizer. Simple yet effective.

38
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,030
I put 5 tablesp of rice into a clean

39
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:15,770
bottle.

41
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,319
Then I add about one liter of room

42
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,319
temperature water and stir well.

43
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,640
I let the mixture soak for about 1 hour

44
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,160
so the nutrients from the rice can begin

45
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:37,920
to dissolve into the water.

47
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,920
After about 1 hour of soaking, I stir

48
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,400
well to help the nutrients from the rice

49
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,520
deeply infuse into the water, preparing

50
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:54,879
for the next step in orchid care.

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,599
Uh, I place the orchid roots into a

53
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,760
clean cup, then pour in the prepared

54
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:05,560

55
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,560

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,959
Rice water contains vitamin B1 and

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,720
natural amino acids which help stimulate

59
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,400

While waiting for the roots to soak, I

63
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,000
make use of a used plastic bottle to

64
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,599
create an orchid pot. a method that

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,250
helps retain moisture without the need

66
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,430

Recycling used plastic bottles not only

69
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,920
saves costs but also helps reduce

70
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,740

Um, I make a few small holes at the

98
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,840
bottom of the two orchid pots to allow

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,840
good drainage and keep the roots well

gently take the orchid out and begin

planting it into the new pot I've

I choose crushed pine bark as the

108
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,319
growing medium for orchids because it's

109
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,960
airy, retains moisture well, and is very

110
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,750

113

The growing medium needs to be

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,720
sterilized before planting to eliminate

115
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,319
harmful fungi and bacteria, protecting

116
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,060

119
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,639
After planting, you only need to water

120
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,919
once. With this method, you only need to

121
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,919
add more water when it runs low.

122

[Music]

123
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,160
Uh the water level should just barely

124
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,840
touch the bottom of the pot. This allows

125
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,960
the orchid roots to absorb moisture

126
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,960
without becoming water logged.

127
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,039
You can also mist the plant to maintain

128
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,800
humidity when the weather is too dry,

129
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,599
creating an ideal environment for

130
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,599
healthy orchid growth.

131
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,680
Place the orchid pot in a spot with

132
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,520
gentle sunlight and add slowrelease

133
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,360
fertilizer to the growing medium to

134
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,360
provide long-term nutrients for the

135
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,360

136
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,520
And here is the result. After 2 months,

137
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,240
the orchid has grown strong and produced

138
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,240
a new flower spike.

139
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,039
Many new flower spikes have grown on the

140
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,440
same plant. This shows that the orchid

141
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:17,800
is thriving with strong roots, vibrant

142
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,800
