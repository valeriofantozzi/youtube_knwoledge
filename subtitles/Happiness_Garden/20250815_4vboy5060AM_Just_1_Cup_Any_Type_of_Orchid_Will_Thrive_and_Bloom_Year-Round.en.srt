00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,240
like this, don't rush to throw it away.

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,480
In this video, I'll guide you on how to

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,119
treat rot and restore it so it can can

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,119
quickly bloom again.

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,800
Prune off the dry stems, damaged roots,

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,680

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,120
the orchid has grown very healthily with

194
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,600
vibrant green leaves and strong roots.

198
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,740

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,760
the orchid after blooming may become

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,480
weak. Its leaves could turn yellow.

239
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,160
Roots may dry out or rot. And it will be

240
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,160
very difficult for the plant to bloom

241
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,160

Avoid using rough cloths or materials

Wiping off excess water from the leaf

392
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,320
axles of orchids is an important step in

393
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,480
orchid care because stagnant water on

394
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,250
the leaves can lead to issues like rot

395

Do all four steps once a week with this

liquid fertilizer for your orchids.

401
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,480
Place it in a well-lit area so the

402
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:46,120
orchid can photosynthesize and

403
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,120
metabolize properly.

416

If the new roots are not strong and

healthy, the plant will struggle to

421
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:21,340
supply nutrition and moisture to the

422

necessary nutrients and moisture to

retain moisture well while also draining
