Welcome to my Happiness Garden channel.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:10,898
This video will reveal an interesting secret:

3
00:00:10,898 --> 00:00:19,897
Using Coca-Cola can stimulate plants to flower without spending too much care.

4
00:00:22,276 --> 00:00:30,894
First I took 1 teaspoon of rice.

5
00:00:42,892 --> 00:00:50,890
then pour in 50ml of Cocacola.

6
00:00:58,352 --> 00:01:08,887
Then incubate for 2 hours so that the nutrients completely dissolve in the cocacola.

7
00:01:14,886 --> 00:01:18,885
2 Hours Later

8
00:01:32,882 --> 00:01:40,881
Puree the rice in this cocacola water.

9
00:01:51,126 --> 00:01:58,877
 
Filter out residue.

10
00:02:03,876 --> 00:02:12,874
Add water to make 2 liters of solution.

11
00:02:22,724 --> 00:02:28,871
Step 1: Clean the leaves with rice water and cocacola.

12
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:43,868
You wipe the surface of orchid leaves with this coca-cola water.

13
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:56,899
Wipe both the top and bottom of the leaf.

14
00:03:05,897 --> 00:03:15,895
This method helps repel insects and fungi on leaves very well.

15
00:03:22,746 --> 00:03:32,892
The nutrients in Cocacola and rice provide nutrients similar to foliar fertilizer for orchids.

16
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:55,887
If you regularly do this every 2 weeks, the orchid leaves will be very well protected.

17
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:06,885
The leaves will be healthy, green and pest-free.

18
00:04:22,277 --> 00:04:25,881
Step 2:

19
00:04:28,881 --> 00:04:34,879
Now take care of the roots.

20
00:04:38,191 --> 00:04:46,877
You only need to water orchids once a week.

21
00:04:49,876 --> 00:04:59,874
Coca-Cola contains phosphoric acid which has a mild bleaching effect.

22
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:13,872
Therefore, it will eliminate fungal diseases on pots and roots very well.

23
00:05:21,436 --> 00:05:31,868
In addition, Coca-Cola also has the ability to kill some insects that harm plant roots such as:

24
00:05:31,868 --> 00:05:38,900
Snails and cockroaches are very good.

25
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:53,897
Coca-Cola helps neutralize acid in pots when you use too much chemical fertilizer.

26
00:05:58,256 --> 00:06:08,894
Rice water contains nutrients such as protein, potassium, magnesium, and calcium,

27
00:06:08,894 --> 00:06:18,892
are important substances for the growth of ornamental plants, especially orchids.

28
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:33,889
Substances in rice water act as growth stimulants, encouraging plants to grow and flower.

29
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:48,886
Rice water creates a favorable environment for beneficial microorganisms to grow in orchid pots.

30
00:07:03,883 --> 00:07:06,883
Result.

31
00:07:09,882 --> 00:07:19,880
When applying this method, my orchid develops a very good and healthy root system.

32
00:07:33,877 --> 00:07:41,876
Helps roots absorb maximum plant nutrients

33
00:07:52,874 --> 00:08:02,872
Because orchids are healthy, each plant has many flower stems on one plant.

34
00:08:12,883 --> 00:08:22,868
An orchid can produce 5-6 flower buds at the same time.

35
00:08:56,156 --> 00:09:05,154
Flower buds are kept on branches and do not fall off

36
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:26,888
Sugar in Coca-Cola helps flowers stay fresh longer.

37
00:09:34,245 --> 00:09:42,885
Orchids will not be exhausted after blooming.

38
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:53,883
Hopefully the video will help you take better care of orchids at home.

39
00:09:53,883 --> 00:09:59,882
Thank you for watching the video. Good luck. See you again in the next videos.
