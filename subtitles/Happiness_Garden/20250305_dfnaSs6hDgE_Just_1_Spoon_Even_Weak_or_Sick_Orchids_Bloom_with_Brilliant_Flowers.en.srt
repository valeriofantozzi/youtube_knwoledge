197
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:29,560
prevents pests and diseases keeping the

198
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,560
plant healthy and thriving

199
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,800

experience at its best

205
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
for countries that don't have an audio

206
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,040
language option available you can go to

207
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,759
the settings and select subtitles in the

00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,040
nutrients directly through the leaves

212
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:55,519
allowing the plant to absorb them faster

213
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,519
and grow better

214
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,240
step two if you have a large number of

215
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,920
orchid pots you can pour the mixture

216
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,920
into a spray bottle

217
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,959
then spray the mixture over the entire

218
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:50,079
orchid plant just like fol or

219
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:53,839
fertilizing to effectively provide

220
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,839
nutrients through the leaves

221
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:12,120
this method also helps wash away dust

222
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,760
mold and insects that may be on the

223
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,760
surface of the leaves

225
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,039
in addition spraying this mixture helps

improve the plant's Health increases its

227
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:43,080
photosynthesis ability and stimulates

228
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,080

step three use a soft cloth to gently

232
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,679
absorb any excess mixture on the leaves

233
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,919
to remove impurities prevent the orchids

234
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:15,440
from becoming overly damp and keep the

235
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:15,440
leaves clean and well ventilated

237
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,080
this method keeps the orchids well

ventilated helping to prevent common

239
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,600
diseases especially rot caused by

240
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,600

242
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,039
step four water this mixture onto the

243
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:43,400
roots to provide essential nutrients

244
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,159
stimulate healthy root growth and ensure

245
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,880
they effectively absorb the necessary

246
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:48,880
elements from the soil

247
00:19:50,170 --> 00:20:05,789
[Music]

248
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:16,600
simply water each pot with about 10

249
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,919
tablespoons of the mixture which is

250
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:22,000
enough to provide the necessary

251
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,000
nutrients for Healthy Growth

252
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,919
this fertilizer helps the roots absorb

253
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,400
essential vitamins and minerals to grow

256
00:20:54,039 --> 00:21:00,080
quickly and enhances their ability to

257
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,080
absorb nutrients from the soil

258
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,640
step one use a soft cotton pad to soak

259
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:13,200

upper and lower surfaces of the

261
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:22,760
leaves it maintains proper moisture

262
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:27,320
levels and prevents root rot caused by

263
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,320
overwatering or excessive dampness

264
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,960
it introduces beneficial microorganisms

265
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,919
to the root environment supporting

266
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,440
nutrient breakdown and improving

267
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:41,440
absorption

268
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,480
efficiency then place the Orchid pop in

269
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,400
a spot with gentle sunlight to allow

270
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,919
photosynthesis which enhances nutrient

271
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,720
exchange and promotes the plant's growth

272
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,600
which enhances nutrient exchange and

273
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,600
