Hello everyone. Today I will share five

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,640
simple ways to revive weak orchids so

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,759
they always stay healthy and bloom

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,759
brilliantly right at home.

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,720
Is your orchid struggling? Don't worry.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,480
With these simple tips, you can

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,670
completely help them revive and bloom

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:29,039
brilliantly right at home.

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,640
So, let's get started.

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,800
Look at this orchid. It's quite weak

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,680
with soft, wrinkled leaves, as if it

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,520
needs a boost of energy to revive.

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,840
In this video, I will guide you step by

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,160
step on how to care for and restore the

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:51,000
plant, helping it become healthy again

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,000
and bloom brilliantly right at home.

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,280
The first step is to check the

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,800
substrate, old fertilizer, and the

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,640
orchid's roots so you can understand

21
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,640
what the plant needs to revive.

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,879
Look at this substrate. It's very dry

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,040
and needs immediate care for the orchid

24
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,040
to recover.

26
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,119
The old inorganic fertilizer granules

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,040
mixed in this substrate also need to be

28
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,040
removed as they can damage the orchid's

29
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,040
roots.

31
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,600
Next, check the orchid's roots to see if

32
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,600
they are healthy.

[Music]

34
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,840
At the bottom of the pot, there are

35
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,159
quite a few leftover inorganic

36
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,160
fertilizer granules. It seems this

37
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,599
orchid doesn't do well with inorganic

38
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,599
fertilizer when cared for at home.

39
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,959
Many roots are damaged, so we need to

40
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,360
cut away all the hollow and harmed

41
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,520
roots. Um, when an orchid's roots are

42
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,200
injured, bacteria, mold, or viruses can

43
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,200
invade and harm the plant if not treated

44
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,200
promptly.

prevent disease from spreading to other

48
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,360

49
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,360
overall health of the orchid.

50
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,640
Leave only the fresh firm roots like

51
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,760
these. These roots will help the plant

52
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,760
recover well.

53
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,280
Next, cut away all the damaged leaves so

54
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,680
the plant can focus on nourishing the

55
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,680

breeding grounds for bacteria, mold, or

expend a lot of energy, reducing its

67
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,360

The next step is to fertilize the orchid

80
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,720
to help it recover. But first, soak the

81
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,560
wilted plant in water for about 1 hour

82
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,560
so the roots get enough moisture,

83
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,800
helping the plant absorb the fertilizer

84
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,800
more effectively.

85
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:22,840
To prepare the fertilizer, first take

86
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,840
500 ml of water in a clean cup.

Then add/ teaspoon of sugar to the

89
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,160
water. It's best to use brown sugar

90
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,319
because it provides extra minerals for

91
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,319
the orchid.

1 hour, take it out and dip the wilted

96
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,000
leaves into the sugar water for about 20

97
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:20,280

Sugar helps wilted leaves recover faster

101
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,319
nutrients, aiding cell regeneration and

102

making the leaves healthy.

103
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,440
Additionally, the sugar water helps the

wilted plant reduce stress, allowing the

191
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,800
out. After that, place the orchid pot in

192
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,680
a well-lit area and maintain liquid

193
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,560
fertilization every 10 days. This care

194
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,360
method helps the plant absorb nutrients

195
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,600
well, promotes strong root growth, and

196
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,220
keeps leaves and flowers vibrant and

197
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:25,779
healthy.

00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:25,779
[Music]

199
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,680
And here is the result. After one month

200
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,440
of care, many new healthy roots have

201
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:38,199
grown, creating a strong foundation for

202
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,199
the orchid to recover its wilted leaves.

203
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:59,040
[Music]

204
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,560
These new roots will absorb water and

205
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,800
nutrients effectively, helping the

206
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,800
wilted leaves recover quickly and become

207
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,800
healthier.

208
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:16,800
[Music]

209
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,680
Next, continue applying this liquid

210
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,680
fertilizer regularly every 10 days. This

211
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,440
ensures the roots, leaves, and flowers

212
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,959
receive enough nutrients, helping the

213
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,390
orchid grow healthily and bloom

214
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,679
brilliantly.

215
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:30,679
[Music]

216
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,760
Um, additionally, you can also use other

217
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,079
types of natural fertilizers to care for

218
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,839
orchids. Uh, this not only provides

219
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,320
nutrients but also helps the plants grow

220
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:49,720
safely with shiny green leaves and

221
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,720
brilliant blooms.

[Music]

223
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,040
And here is the result after the next 3

224
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,519
months. You can see the orchid has fully

225
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:15,959
recovered, growing strongly with healthy

226
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,959
roots and shiny, firm green leaves.

227
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,199
You can see that not only has the orchid

228
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,240
recovered, but it has also grown two new

229
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:30,680
flower stems. Very plump and healthy,

230
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,680
promising brilliant blooms soon.

231
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,480
Uh, what do you think about how I

232
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,160
revived this small orchid? Don't

233
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,000
hesitate to leave a comment and share

234
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,240
your thoughts. I'm eager to hear your

235
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,279
feedback and experiences.

238
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,600
Take care of your orchid with all the

239
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,360
love and attention you give it. And in

240
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,600

full of vitality.

243
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,760
When you spend time and pay attention to

244
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,600
every little detail, the orchid senses

245
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:27,959
that love and responds with brilliant,

246
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,959
healthy, and vibrant flowers.

247
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,840
Orchids are not only beautiful plants,

248
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,000
but also a testament to love, patience,

249
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,080
and meticulous care. Each blooming

250
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,470
flower reflects the dedication and

251
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,200
affection you give to the plant.

253
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,440
Let your orchids grow in an environment

254
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,520
full of care and love and you will see

255
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,520
that they not only become strong but

256
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,520
also bloom beautifully and brilliantly.
