Welcome to this video!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,932
This is dendrobium orchid.

3
00:00:07,932 --> 00:00:15,897
an orchid that is said to be beautiful and has a gentle fragrance.

4
00:00:15,897 --> 00:00:23,888
They have the ability to bloom all year round and keep the flowers on the branches for a long time.

5
00:00:23,888 --> 00:00:32,627
If you are looking for an easy way to breed this most beautiful orchid in the world?

6
00:00:33,627 --> 00:00:42,667
Let me show you the simple yet effective secret!

7
00:00:45,923 --> 00:00:55,889
I cut this old orchid to propagate.

8
00:01:47,663 --> 00:02:02,225
Apply toothpaste to the cut to help it heal quickly.

9
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:27,691
then wait for the toothpaste to dry.

10
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:41,490
Recycle plastic bottles into tools to stimulate rooting and sprouting.

11
00:03:54,198 --> 00:04:01,186
Dry cuts.

12
00:04:12,202 --> 00:04:20,182
Take 1 aloe vera leaf.

13
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:48,477
Apply aloe vera gel all over this dry orchid.

14
00:05:14,834 --> 00:05:21,803
Then wait for the aloe vera gel to dry.

15
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:49,531
Put the dry orchid branches into this plastic bottle.

16
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:31,290
Place the bottle here and insert moss around it to help retain moisture.

17
00:07:30,615 --> 00:07:40,609
Water regularly to keep the environment moist.

18
00:07:43,751 --> 00:07:52,740
This helps the orchid germinate faster.

19
00:08:14,347 --> 00:08:23,426
Then put it in a cool place and wait for the orchid to revive.

20
00:08:34,485 --> 00:08:36,485

21
00:08:40,072 --> 00:08:46,063
2 MONTHS LATER

22
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:04,947
With this method, after only 2 months, the old withered orchid branches were revived.

23
00:10:29,991 --> 00:10:39,974
Now I cut them out to plant in pots.

24
00:11:07,284 --> 00:11:16,300
