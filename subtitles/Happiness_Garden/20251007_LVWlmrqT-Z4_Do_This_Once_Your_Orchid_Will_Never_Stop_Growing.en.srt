Welcome to the garden of happiness where

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:07,200
every leaf and every flower tells a

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,880
story of life and joy. Here we explore

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,960
together the little wonders that nature

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,960
gives us and learn how to nurture

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:17,199
happiness with our own hands.

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,039
The topic of today's video is do this

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,039
once your orchid will never stop

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,039
growing.

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,480
And when you see the new roots

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
stretching out strongly, you'll feel the

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,880
true happiness that comes from caring

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,559
for orchids. With just a little love, a

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,880
little patience, and today's simple

15
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,680
secret, your orchid will become

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,600
healthier than ever.

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,600
And now, let's get started together to

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,550
make a special natural fertilizer that

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,719
helps orchids grow endlessly.

[Music]

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,680
To start making this natural fertilizer,

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,320
the first ingredient we need is onion.

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,160
You just need about 10 g of onion. This

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,920
is an important component that helps

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,260
stimulate root growth and strengthen

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,600
your orchid's resistance.

[Music]

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,720
Onion contains natural sulfur, a

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,799
valuable mineral that helps stimulate

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,520
strong root growth and protects the

31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,760
plant from fungal diseases. That's why

32
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,000
when you use onion in your natural

33
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,680
fertilizer formula, you're giving your

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,080
orchid a source of energy that

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,620
strengthens its roots, keeps its leaves

36
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,360
green, and supports sustainable growth.

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,160
After cutting the onion into small

39
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:36,690
pieces, put them all into a clean jar.

[Music]

41
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,000
The next ingredient is rice. You just

42
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,560
need to add about 3 teaspoons of rice. A

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,799
small amount, but incredibly effective.

44
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,960
Rice contains natural starch and vitamin

45
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,960
B, which help nourish the roots,

46
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,430
stimulate new shoots to grow, and boost

47
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:02,269
the overall vitality of your orchid.

Next, blend it thoroughly. This step

53
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,680
helps release all the nutrients from the

54
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,440
onion and rice, creating a smooth

55
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,720
mixture that's easy for your orchids to

56
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,720
absorb when you use it for their care.

57
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,239

After blending, close the lid tightly

65
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,239

organic fertilizer for your orchid.

69
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,239
The next morning, after the mixture has

70
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,159

Wiping the leaves with the onion and

102
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,280
rice mixture naturally cleans the leaf

103
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,520

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,000
and mold that may have accumulated over

105
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,000

106
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,479
stamata open more easily, allowing the

daily freshness and health.

109
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,520
When the leaves are clean, the orchid

110
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,440
can absorb light more effectively,

111
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,520
allowing photosynthesis to occur more

112
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,440
vigorously. This helps the plant

113
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,919
synthesize energy better, promoting

114
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,720
balanced and vibrant growth of roots,

nutrients like vitamin B and minerals

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,199
are absorbed through the leaf epidermis,

121
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,639
nourishing the cells and helping the

122

sulfur content in onions, which has

strong antifungal and antibacterial

129
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,720

130
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,120
with this solution helps the orchid

131
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,120

enough nutrients, the orchid will grow

136
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,720
more comprehensively. Roots grow strong,

137

new shoots develop quickly, and flowers

186
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,279

187
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:39,240

188
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,240
orchid develops more comprehensively.

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,959
Misting helps increase light humidity

192
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,360
some fungal diseases, keeping the orchid

193
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,680
healthy and reducing stress caused by

194

195
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,080
After watering, you can leave the pot

196
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,600
and soak it in this mixture for about 20

197
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,519
minutes, allowing the nutrients to

198
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,760
penetrate deeply into the roots and

199
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,560

200
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,560

After soaking for about 20 minutes,

203
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,200
remember to take the orchid pot out of

204
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,120
the mixture. This helps prevent the

205
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,360
growing medium from staying too wet for

206
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,800

207
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,800
nutrients absorbed by the roots.

208
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,560
If there is still water on the leaves

209
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,360
after watering or soaking, you should

210
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,440
use a dry cloth to absorb it. This small

211
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,760
but important step helps prevent fungal

212
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,000
diseases and leaf rot while keeping the

213
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,680
leaf surface dry, allowing the orchid to

214
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,839
absorb nutrients more effectively and

215
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,839

a spot with gentle sunlight. The soft

photosynthesis.

223
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,839
This also helps the plant boost its

225
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,640
