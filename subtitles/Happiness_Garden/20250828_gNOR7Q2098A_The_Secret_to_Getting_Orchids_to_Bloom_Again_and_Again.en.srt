00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,200
Welcome to the place where the beauty of

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,879
nature touches your everyday.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,920
If you want your orchids to bloom

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,599
beautifully and stay healthy, in this

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,480
video I will share how to care for

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:18,839
orchids using natural fertilizers that

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,839
you can make right in your own kitchen.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,640
Your orchid will produce many new flower

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,840
spikes on the same plant with strong,

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,840
dense roots that grip firmly.

11
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,280
The petals will be vibrant, fresh, and

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,600
spread their fragrance throughout the

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,559
space, bringing a sense of peace and

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,559
happiness to everyone around.

15
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,399
Do you have tofu? Tofu contains a lot of

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,640
protein and natural minerals, helping

17
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,719
orchids grow healthier and stronger.

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,760
Just about 10 g of tofu is enough to

19
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,760
provide nutrients for the orchid.

20
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,520
Put into a cup of water and blend the

21
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:21,590
tofu until smooth.

22
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:21,590
[Music]

23
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,790
[Applause]

24
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,320
strain out the residue to get a smooth

25
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,320
solution.

26
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,960
Then dilute the fertilizer mixture with

27
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:55,240
about 12 cups of water to make a

28
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,240
moderate orchid watering solution.

29
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,439
Uh remember to dilute the solution

30
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,040
before watering the orchid. If the

31
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,240
solution is too concentrated, the

32
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,000
orchid's roots may be damaged and uh the

33
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,800
plant will have difficulty absorbing

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,360
nutrients.

35
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,520
Method one, water this mixture directly

36
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,959
onto the roots and the plant's medium.

37
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,800
This method helps the nutrients

38
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,720
penetrate deeply into the roots,

39
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,080
stimulating the orchid to grow healthily

40
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,080
and produce many new flower spikes.

41
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,680
Watering this mixture helps improve the

42
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,239
overall health of the orchid. The leaves

43
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,160
will be lush and strong. And this method

44
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,580
also prevents yellowing or wilting

45
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:45,280
caused by nutrient deficiency.

46
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:47,280
[Music]

47
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,599
The mixture also stimulates roots to

48
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,440
grow strong, dense, and firmly attached

49
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,200
to the medium, allowing the plant to

50
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,440
absorb water and nutrients more

51
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,440
effectively, contributing to consistent

52
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,440
flowering.

65
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:41,519
[Music]

66
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,319
Uh, you can soak this type of fertilizer

67
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,480
for about 10 to 20 minutes. This method

68
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:50,519
helps the plant's roots absorb maximum

69
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,519
nutrients and grow healthier.

70
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,680
Method two, put the mixture into a spray

71
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,840
bottle and evenly mist the entire

72
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,599
orchid. This method helps the leaves

73
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,840
absorb nutrients, the plant grow

74
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,840
vigorously, and the flowers stay fresh

75
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,840
longer.

76
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,920
Spraying the mixture helps the orchid

77
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,680
leaves directly absorb essential

78
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,439
nutrients, allowing the plant to grow

79
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,339
healthy and better resist pests and

80
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:19,509
diseases.

81
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,509
[Music]

82
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,199
Spraying the mixture also creates a

83
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,520
natural protective layer on the leaf

84
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:32,440
surface, preventing yellowing, wilting,

85
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,440
or drying caused by nutrient deficiency.

86
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:38,080
[Music]

87
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,560
Spraying the mixture also helps enhance

88
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,280
the plant's metabolism, promoting even

89
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,280
growth of roots, leaves, and flowers,

90
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,860
resulting in an overall healthy and

91
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,720
vibrant appearance.

92
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,240
[Music]

93
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,479
And now I will share the second method

94
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,320
to make fertilizer from tofu, allowing

95
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,600
you to store it longer and use it when

96
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,040
needed.

97
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,919
[Music]

98
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,880
This time you need about 20 g of tofu to

99
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,880
prepare the fertilizer mixture.

100
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,600
[Music]

101
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,020
Put it into a cup of water, then blend

102
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:21,220
it together with the tofu until smooth.

103
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:21,220
[Music]

104
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:40,339
[Music]

105
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:48,520
Then pour the mixture into a clean

106
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,520
bottle. to prepare for fermentation.

107
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:55,290
[Music]

108
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,840
Remember to leave some space at the top.

109
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,160
This ensures the fermentation process

110
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:06,199
occurs safely, preventing overflow or

111
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,199
pressure buildup in the bottle.

112
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,240
Then add 1 teasp of yeast to the

113
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,520
mixture. You can also use dry baking

114
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,520
yeast as a substitute if you like.

115
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,960
[Music]

116
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,120
Then add 3 tsp of brown sugar to the

117
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,280
mixture. This helps the fermentation

118
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,520
process occur faster and prevents the

119
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,199
mixture from spoiling as the sugar

120
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,199
provides food for the yeast to work

121
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,199
effectively.

122
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,280
Stir the mixture well so that all the

123
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,160
ingredients are fully combined and the

124
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,160
yeast can work effectively.

125
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,639
Next, close the bottle and leave it in a

126
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,030
cool ventilated place for about 1 month

127
00:06:52,639 --> 00:07:06,800
for the mixture to ferment completely.

128
00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:08,639
[Music]

129
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,160
And here is the bottle I have fermented

130
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:14,080
for 1 month. Now the mixture is ready to

131
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,300
be diluted into a nutrient solution and

132
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:22,639
used to water the orchids.

133
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:24,720
[Music]

134
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,960
I take about 3 tablespoons of the

135
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,599
fermented mixture to prepare a nutrient

136
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,599
solution for the orchids.

137
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:36,339
[Music]

138
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,080
Then dilute the fertilizer mixture with

139
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:48,280
about 12 cups of water to make a

140
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,280
moderate orchid watering solution.

141
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:01,199
Method one, use a soft cloth to soak up

142
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,039
the mixture and gently wipe both the top

143
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,039
and bottom surfaces of the orchid

144
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,039
leaves.

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,560
[Music]

146
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,080
Wiping the leaves helps the nutrients

147
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,400
penetrate directly into the leaves,

148
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,960
supporting photosynthesis and enhancing

149
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,960
the plant's vitality.

150
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,599
This method also cleans dust from the

151
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:29,400
leaves, prevents mold and pests, and

152
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,400
keeps the orchid healthy.

153
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,080
Additionally, wiping the leaves evenly

154
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,159
makes them glossy and strong, improves

155
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,210
their ability to absorb light, and

156
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:51,200
contributes to more vibrant flowering.

[Music]

158
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,040
Um, if you do this one to two times a

159
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,360
month, the orchid leaves will always be

160
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,920
glossy and disease-free, helping the

161
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,920
plant grow healthy.

162
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,360
Method two, water the diluted fertilizer

163
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,030
mixture directly onto the orchid's roots

164
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:16,389

169
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,240
When fermented, tofu becomes a

170
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,040
nutrient-rich organic fertilizer, ready

171
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,040
to nourish the orchid.

172
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,640
This is a natural source of nutrients

173
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:43,880
that helps orchids grow healthy, develop

174
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,880
strong roots, and bloom for a long time.

watering with this fertilizer mixture

178
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,560
helps the flowers last longer, maintain

183
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,160
care. You can see many new roots growing

184
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,160
strong and firmly attached to the

185
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,160
medium.

186
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,680
These new roots will help the plant

187
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,600
absorb nutrients better, grow healthy,

188
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,000
and produce more beautiful flowers in

189
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,000
the next season.
