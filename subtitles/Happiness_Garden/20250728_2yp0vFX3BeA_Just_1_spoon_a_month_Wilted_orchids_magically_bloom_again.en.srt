Welcome to the Happiness Garden channel. 
In this video, I will continue to share  

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,760
with you another gentle method that 
uh helps the flower spike recover and  

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,840
continue blooming even after the 
first round of flowers has faded.

6
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,040
These are the flower spikes after 
the previous blooming has faded.

7
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,040
Uh let me know in the comments 
which country you're watching  

8
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:05,360
from. It's wonderful that we can 
connect from all around the world.

9
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:13,360
But these nodes can still continue to bloom 
if you know how to take care of them properly.

10
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,120
I have removed all the wilted 
flowers so that the plant so  

11
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:35,840
that the plant can focus its energy 
on nourishing the roots and leaves.

wonderful to have you along on this journey.

14
00:01:48,080 --> 00:02:03,440
I also remove the diseased leaves to 
prevent the spread to the rest of the plant.

15
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:10,080
I continued to remove all the damaged roots so the 
plant can focus on growing new, healthier ones.

16
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,120
Damaged roots can become a breeding 
ground for bacteria and fungi,  

17
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:31,920
making the plant more susceptible 
to disease and harder to recover.

18
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,560
Then sprinkle cinnamon powder on the cuts to  

19
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,120
help them dry quickly and prevent 
bacteria or fungi from entering.

20
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:04,800
Then let the plant sit for a day without 
watering, allowing the cuts to dry completely.

21
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,120
One day later, now we start 
making natural fertilizer  

22
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:26,560
to care for the orchid. Take 2 L of clean water.

23
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,200
Take one spoonful of rice.

24
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:57,280
Then take three teaspoons of soybeans.

25
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:21,040
Pour into one liter of boiling water. Wait 
for the water to cool before using it.

26
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:50,480
After 1 hour, stir well to release the nutrients 
from the rice. Then gently decant the clear water.

27
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,000
Once the water has cooled, mix the soybean soaking 
water with the rice water. This combination  

28
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:16,080
merges nutrients from both ingredients, 
making it excellent for orchid growth.

29
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,560
Next, take the remaining grains and sprinkle 
about 10 to 20 seeds into each pot. Then,  

30
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:43,280
gently bury them beneath the roots to allow 
the orchid to slowly absorb the nutrients.

31
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,520
Now I use this water to water the 
orchid roots once every 1 to two weeks.

32
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,600
Rice water contains many essential 
nutrients such as potassium,  

33
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:31,920
phosphorus, and other natural minerals 
that help promote healthy plant growth.

34
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,800
Meanwhile, soybeans are very rich in 
nitrogen, a key element for plant growth,  

35
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:56,080
especially essential during the stages of 
sprouting, flowering, and leaf development.

36
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,800
And I continue to spray this water 
on the leaves once or twice a week.

37
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,640
When sprayed on the plant, the nutrients 
from soybeans and rice also provide proteins  

38
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,520
and essential amino acids, compounds 
that help the plant grow healthily,  

39
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:20,480
recover quickly, and effectively 
stimulate root and flower development.

40
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:26,000
In addition, you can spray this solution directly 
onto the stems and branches. This helps stimulate  

41
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:41,120
the growth of new flower spikes, contributing to 
a more vibrant blooming season for your orchid.

42
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,240
And this is the result after 1 month of 
consistent care. You can clearly see that  

43
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,880
the old flower spikes have begun to sprout new 
buds, promising a beautiful blooming season ahead.

44
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,440
This helps the orchid continue to sprout and 
bloom from the old flower spikes themselves.  

45
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:15,120
A natural way to extend the blooming 
season without cutting the spikes.

46
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,320
What do you think about the way I revived 
this little orchid? Feel free to leave a  

47
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:39,840
comment and share your thoughts. I'd love 
to hear your feedback and experiences.

48
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,160
After that, I continue watering the orchid 
with rice water once or twice a week. A  

49
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:50,240
simple method that helps the roots absorb 
nutrients consistently and grow healthily.

50
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,280
You can also spray rice water on your 
orchid once or twice a week. This helps  

51
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:17,280
the leaves stay lush and green, retains natural 
moisture, and stimulates overall plant growth.

52
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,200
Spraying it on the stems also helps deliver 
nutrients directly to the flower buds, supporting  

53
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:46,160
their development and helping the blooms 
grow larger, more beautiful, and last longer.

54
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,520
Uh and here is the result after the following 
month. You can see the orchid has bloomed with  

55
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:03,440
many magnificent flowers bringing radiant 
beauty and vibrant life to your garden.

56
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,000

Thank you so much for joining me. 
Wishing you happiness, good health,  

59
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:28,000
and beautiful, thriving orchids all 
year round. See you in the next videos.

60
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,160
Hi everybody. In this video, I share 
how to care for orchids to help them  

61
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,960
grow quickly and flower many times in the 
same year. You see, my orchids new flowers  

62
00:10:40,960 --> 00:11:09,840
always grow after old ones fall. So my orchids 
bloom all year round from branch to branch.

63
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,920
The flowers bloom for a long time 
before dropping their petals and  

64
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:20,960
can stay on the branches for up to 6 months.

65
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:27,280
Um, please comment to me which country 
you are watching the video from. It's  

66
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:36,640
great that we can chat together from all over 
the world. Many flowers grow on the same tree.

67
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:59,040
new roots grow a lot to 
help absorb nutrients best.

68
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:13,840
Chubby flower buds.

69
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:27,440
Help flowers bloom long on branches.

70
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:35,040
Brilliant flowers.

71
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:47,840
How to make fertilizer as follows. Use 
one small carrot weighing about 30 g.

72
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:52,960
Cut into small pieces.

73
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:15,520
Add one liter of filtered water.

74
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:34,880
puree.

75
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:40,560
Filter out residue.

76
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,440
Add one liter of filtered water.

77
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:33,760
Then use cotton to soak carrot juice and wipe 
both the top and bottom sides of the leaves.

78
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,240
This method helps repel insects and 
open the stamata. The orchids will  

79
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:51,280
photosynthesize and exchange nutrients better.

80
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,360
At the same time, orchids also absorb 
some nutrients through the leaves,  

81
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:15,760
helping keep the leaves green.

82
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,960

84
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:16,080
Second way,

85
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:23,440
water this carrot for orchids. Carrot juice 
is a good source of nutrients for orchids,  

86
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:34,800
including vitamins and minerals like beta 
carotene, potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus.

87
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,440
Uh when the carrot juice is poured into the 
orchid pot, it provides nutrients to the  

88
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:46,640
orchids and helps to promote their health. 
In addition, carrot juice is also acidic,  

89
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:56,960
which helps regulate the pH of the potted soil and 
enhances the orchid's ability to absorb nutrients.

90
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:05,920
You can soak the orchid pot in 
this carrot juice for 20 minutes.

91
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,840
Do this one two times a month.

92
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:33,040
Third way.

93
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:38,320
Mist moisturizing carrot juice for orchids by 
spraying both the top and bottom of the leaves.  

94
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,960
This helps wash away dirt and eliminate 
insects on your orchids. The nutrients  

95
00:17:42,960 --> 00:18:00,160
in carrot juice support orchid health, 
helping them thrive and bloom beautifully.

96
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,040
However, be careful not to overwater with carrot 
juice as it can clog the water channels in the  

97
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:14,000
orchid. Avoid spraying directly on the flowers 
as this can cause them to fall off quickly.

98
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,080
I hope this video helps you take 
better care of your orchids at home  

99
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,200
and encourages them to bloom easily. Um, 
if you find it helpful and interesting,
