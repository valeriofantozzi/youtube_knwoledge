Hello everyone. Today I will share a

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,890
great way to revive wilted orchids,

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:20,820
helping them grow strong and bloom

[Music]

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:27,760
beautifully. Let's explore together.

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,730
These are orchids that people have

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,899
thrown away.

9
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,160
This orchid is dead so it cannot be

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,730

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,840
cannot be revived.

15
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,360
This orchid is wilted but still alive.

16
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,360
So I decided to bring it home to revive

17
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,360
it.

18
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,450

[Music]

20
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,060
You need to check the roots and cut off

21
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:02,029
all the damaged

22
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:02,029
[Music]

23
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,479
ones. Cutting them off helps stop the

24
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,319
spread of bacteria, mold, and other

25
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:12,560
diseases. After cutting, the orchid will

26
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:16,680
focus its energy on the healthy roots,

27
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,680
helping the plant grow better.

28
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:26,560
[Music]

29
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,640
Then cut off the old orchid flower

30
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,360
spikes and withered leaf stalks to help

31
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,760
the plant focus its energy on developing

32
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,000
new parts, including fresh flower spikes

33
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,680
and

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,680
leaves. When the flowers have faded,

35
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,760
faded, or the leaf stalks become dry and

36
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,680
wilted, cutting them off not only makes

37
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,840
the plant look tidier, but also prevents

38
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,319
the spread of diseases. This helps the

39
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,519
orchid bloom more vigorously and grow

40
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,519
healthier in the next season.

44
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,040
Then soaking the wilted orchid in water

45
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,879
for about 1 hour is a simple yet

46
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,040
effective method to help the plant

47
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,879
recover. This provides moisture to the

48
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,920
roots, making it easier for them to

49
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,760
absorb water and nutrients.

50
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,000
Soaking the orchid also helps remove any

51
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,599
toxins or dirt that may be present on

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,760
the roots, creating a better environment

53
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,080
for the plant to recover quickly and

54
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,080
grow

add it to one liter of

water. Sugar helps revive wilted orchids

60
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,599
by providing an easy source of energy

61
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,759
for the plant. Uh when the orchid is

62
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,600
wilted, it may lack energy due to the

63
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,560
roots not functioning effectively or

64
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,560
being

65
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,560
damaged.

66
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:31,199
Remember to stir well to ensure the

67
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,199
sugar completely dissolves in the

68
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,960
water. Take one liter of

69
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,960
water and add 3 teaspoon of breadcrumbs.

70
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,360
Breadcrumbs can help the orchid quickly

71
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,280
recover and develop roots due to the

72
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,360

solution that provides beneficial

76
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,320
nutrients, giving energy to the plant.

77
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,560
In particular, breadcrumbs can stimulate

78
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,120
the growth of beneficial bacteria in the

79
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,040
soil, improving the root environment and

80
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:23,729
promoting the development of new roots.

Then immerse the wilted leaves in the

diluted sugar water for about 20

87
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,720

leaves, helping them absorb nutrients

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,039
and moisture more effectively. This

92
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,160
process also stimulates cell

93
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:23,050

Now let's mix the diluted sugar solution

108
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,360
with the breadcrumb soaking solution.

109
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,000
This solution provides energy from sugar

110
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,879
and nutrients from the breadcrumbs,

111
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,080
helping the plant recover

112
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:58,080
quickly. The sugar provides

113
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,400
carbohydrates, giving the plant extra

114
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,400
energy, while the breadcrumbs supply

115
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,180
vitamins and minerals, stimulating the

Then soak the orchid roots in this

combined solution for about 20 minutes.

122
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,880
You need to be careful and soak for a

123
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,480
short time to avoid rotting the roots or

124
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,480
affecting them with too much sugar

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,600
The leftover mixed solution from soaking

127
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,839
the orchid roots can be used to

128
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,320
fertilize other orchids, providing

129
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,399
additional nutrients and energy. The

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,920
vitamins, minerals, and carbohydrates

131
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:20,519

After applying this liquid fertilizer,

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:20,000
soak the roots for about 20 minutes to

149
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,560
allow the orchid to absorb the water and

150
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,560
nutrients

151
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,440
effectively. Then take the orchid pot

152
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,519
out and place it in a location with

153
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,519
plenty of light, but avoid direct

154
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,519
sunlight.

155
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,600
To protect the plant, you should place

156
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,000
the orchid in areas with indirect light

157
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,480

159
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:49,040

160
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,040
remove the wilted

161
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,920
orchid. You can see that the orchid

162
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,720
roots have become fresher and greener

172
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,480
growing medium because it can hold water

173
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,399
for a long time and creates a stable,

it is a sign that the plant is gradually

also acidic, which helps regulate the pH

orchid's ability to absorb

399
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:52,890

orchids by spraying both the top and
