Hello friends

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,178
To help you actively propagate orchids at home

3
00:00:06,178 --> 00:00:10,307
Today I share how to propagate from phalaenopsis branches

4
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:16,567
After all the flowers have faded

5
00:00:39,188 --> 00:00:44,381
Peel off the protective film of the sleeping sprout

6
00:00:44,381 --> 00:00:49,316
This will make it easier for this sleeping sprout to germinate

7
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:20,434
1. Apply toothpaste on the freshly cut wound

8
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:41,314
Toothpaste has antiseptic properties, so it will help the cut heal quickly and protect the orchid from rotting

9
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:51,545
Wait for the toothpaste to dry

10
00:01:53,612 --> 00:01:58,610
Wait for the toothpaste to dry

11
00:02:07,547 --> 00:02:10,541
Chopped

12
00:02:37,038 --> 00:02:42,035
Squeeze to let the aloe vera gel come out

13
00:02:47,213 --> 00:02:52,065
Aloe vera helps stimulate sprouts to germinate faster

14
00:03:04,944 --> 00:03:09,930
3. Use 1 teaspoon of cinnamon powder with 500ml of boiled water

15
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:33,325
Incubate for 2 hours

16
00:03:47,054 --> 00:03:52,021
Filter out residue

17
00:03:56,779 --> 00:04:01,753
Mix aloe vera gel with cinnamon juice in the ratio 1/1

18
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:18,316
4. Soak orchid branches in solution of aloe vera gel and cinnamon water for 20 minutes

19
00:04:25,392 --> 00:04:30,380
5. Soak moss in cinnamon water for 20 minutes

20
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:40,478
6. Recycle plastic boxes into miniature greenhouses to help propagate orchids faster

21
00:04:49,578 --> 00:04:54,935
Perforated air vents above and below the box

22
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:17,604
After soaking for 20 minutes, remove the moss

23
00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:41,366
7. Put orchid branches in miniature greenhouse

24
00:05:46,063 --> 00:05:51,031
Mist once every 5 days and keep it in a shady place, away from direct sunlight

25
00:06:50,774 --> 00:07:01,094
Continue misting once every 5 days and keep in a shady place, away from direct sunlight

26
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:36,943

Now let's plant pots so that the orchid can adapt to the outside environment

28
00:07:56,673 --> 00:07:59,675
Now goodbye and see you in the next videos
