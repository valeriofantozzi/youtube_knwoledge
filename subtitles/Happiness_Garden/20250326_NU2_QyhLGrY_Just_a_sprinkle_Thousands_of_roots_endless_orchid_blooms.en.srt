00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,480
hello

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,240
everyone after the orchid has bloomed

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,600
what should we do to help it grow and

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,600
Bloom

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,080
continuously in this video I'll show you

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:18,240
step-by-step instructions to ensure your

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,240
orchids stay healthy and Bloom

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,080
regularly let's get

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:31,800
started to make fertilizer for this

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,800
Orchid I need about 10 eggshells

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,559
uh eggshells are a natural source of

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,079
calcium which helps improve soil

13
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:45,079
structure boost root development and

14
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,079
prevent diseases in

15
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,079
orchids using eggshells as fertilizer

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,079
helps orchids recover quickly after

17
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,359
blooming stimulating continuous and

18
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:05,359
healthy

19
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:17,920
flowering which country are you watching

20
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,920
videos from please comment for

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,040
me uh it's great that we can chat

22
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,040
together from all over the

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,439
world you need to dry the eggshells and

24
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,439
then grind them into powder

25
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,680
then put the eggshell powder into the

26
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:58,320
jar next bananas are a very good choice

27
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,320
as fertilizer for orchids

28
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,920
take one banana peel and cut it into

29
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,920
small

30
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,280
pieces banana peels are rich in

31
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,160
potassium and minerals which help

32
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,400
stimulate flowering and promote quick

33
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,400
recovery for orchids after Bluing

34
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,959
using banana peels as fertilizer ensures

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,959
consistent and healthy

36
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,319
blooming add 1 liter of boiling water

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,440
cover and leave overnight to let the

38
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:09,440
nutrients mix into the

39
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,920
water next I use oatmeal to make natural

40
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,920
fertilizer

41
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,760
take three teaspoons of

42
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,319
oatmeal add 1 liter of water at room

43
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,519
temperature cover and leave overnight to

44
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:02,519
let the nutrient mix into the

45
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,879
water this is an orchid I bought at an

46
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,480
industrial orchid garden and has

47
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,480
finished blooming

48
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,360
uh to care for the plant to continue

49
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,720
flowering I first need to cut off the

50
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,720
damaged leaves

51
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:52,240
then cut off the old flower

52
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,000

me then use coffee powder to apply to

57
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,479
the cut to help the wound heal quickly

58
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,560
leave it overnight for the cut to heal

59
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,560
completely

60
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,240
after one

61
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:12,400
night stir well so that the nutrients

62
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:12,400
dissolve into the water

63
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,039
filter out eggshells and banana

66
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,479
use soft cotton to wipe the leaves to

67
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,479
help keep them

68
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,720
cleaner wiping leaves helps remove dust

69
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,520
debris and bacteria from Leaf surfaces

70
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:21,319
helping orchid leaves breathe better and

71
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,319
absorb light more effectively

72
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,360
wiping leaves helps enhance

73
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,080
photosynthesis because clean leaves

74
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:42,759
absorb light better and can metabolize

75
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,759
energy more efficiently

76
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,159
wiping leaves with this water helps

77
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,000
reduce the risk of mold bacterial

78
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:07,599
diseases because clean Leaf surfaces

79
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,440
limit the environment for harmful

80
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,440
pathogens to grow

81
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,159
step

82
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:46,360
two pour this water into a spray bottle

83
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,360
and spray your

84
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,160
orchid spraying water infused with

85
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,399
banana peels and eggshells provides

86
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,560
nutrients for orchids boosting their

87
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:04,079
resistance promoting quick recovery

88
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,079
after blooming and ensuring continuous

89
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,880
flowering thoroughly spray both the top

90
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,880
and bottom of the

91
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,880
leaves when sprayed on leaves liquid

92
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,120
fertilizer helps orchids absorb

liquid fertilizer solution that is very

102
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:29,560
good for orchids to recover after

113
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,600
orchids uh soak the Orchid pot for 20

114
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,959
minutes so the Orchid can absorb the

115
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,959
most nutrients

116
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,720
after soaking for about 20 minutes take

117
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,040
it out take it out and place the Orchid

118
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,040
pot in a place with plenty of

119
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,800
light step

120
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,959
four water droplets on leaves can create

121
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,560
a favorable environment for mold and

122
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,560
bacteria to

123
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:01,240
grow wiping off water helps reduce the

124
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,240
risk of infection

125
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,240
wiping off the water helps the stomata

126
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,240
stay open and function

127
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:31,160
better and do the above four steps every

128
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,160
10 to 15

129
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,680
days remember no matter how good the

130
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:46,760
fertilizer is if the Orchid lacks light

131
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:51,399
growth and cannot photosynthesize it

132
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:51,399
will still be stunted and grow slowly

133
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:06,120
therefore place the Orchid in a location

134
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,120
with sufficient light for Healthy

135
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Growth results after 50

136
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:31,760
days you can see the roots and leaves of

137
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,760
the Orchid growing very

138
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,480
quickly the leaves are also stronger and

139
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:53,320
glossier and also grew two new flower

140
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,320
buds

141
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,959
oh the roots in the Orchid pot grow so

142
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:26,959
well

143
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,199
new roots are an important factor in

144
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:41,040
helping orchids grow healthily and

145
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,040
sustainably throughout their life

146
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,040
cycle for

147
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,800
um now I plant it in a larger pot so the

148
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,800
Orchid grows

149
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:48,399
healthier as a growing medium I use

150
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:52,759
crushed pine bark to help aate the roots

151
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,759
but still retain the necessary moisture

152
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,399
after planting take care of it like

153
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:21,399
other normal

154
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,480
