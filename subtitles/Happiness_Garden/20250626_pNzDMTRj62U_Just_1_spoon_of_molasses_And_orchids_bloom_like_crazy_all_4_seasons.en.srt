Welcome to the little garden where I

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,680
cultivate not only greenery but also joy

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:11,200
and peace everyday. I hope you will find

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,960
a relaxing corner for your soul here.

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,200
In this video, I share how to care for

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,359
rotting orchids using natural, simple,

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,240
and easy to find ingredients right in

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,400
your own kitchen.

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,119
No chemicals needed, just a bit of care

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,359
and a love for plants, and you can

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,359
completely help your orchid recover,

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,760
turn green again, and continue its

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,760
journey to bloom.

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,520
Let's get started.

19
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,520
This is an orchid that's having a

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,320
problem. The leaves have started to show

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,079
signs of rot. If not treated in time,

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,640
the disease can spread quickly and

23
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,960
affect the whole plant. But don't worry,

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:05,160
we can still save it with a very simple

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,160
method using natural ingredients.

for a long time without repotting or

35
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,439
changing the growing medium, the old

36
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:52,200
material gradually decays, retains water

37
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,200

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,840
Uh you can see that the growing medium

42
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,319
in the pot is too old and retains too

43
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,440
much water.

44
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,120
This easily leads to root rot, stem rot,

45
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,879
and leaf rot as the plant can no longer

46
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,599
breathe and the environment has become

47
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,599
poorly ventilated.

48
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,080
You can see white mold patches appearing

49
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,599
on the surface of the growing medium.

50
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,760
This is a sign that the growing

51
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,160
environment is no longer clean and well

52
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,000
ventilated, which can harm the roots and

53
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,840
make the orchid more prone to fungal

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,760

57
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,640
like this, it's a clear sign that they

58
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,879
are water logged. The roots can no

59
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,200
longer absorb nutrients and oxygen, and

60
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,330
if not treated in time, the stem and

61
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:10,139

63
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,200
Therefore, I will remove all the old

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,599
growing medium to give the plant a new

65
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,360
clean and wellventilated environment.

66
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,760
This is an important step to stop the

67
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:26,599

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,159
spread of disease and focus its energy

75
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,159

entire orchid under running water.

81
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,960

into a bowl.

90
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,080
Then I add eight drops of methylene

91
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,680

92
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,960

93
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,479

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,720
After stirring well, I cover the

193
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,760
container and leave it in a cool

194
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,399

199
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,720
After hanging for one day, you can see

200
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:50,760
that the orchid roots have completely

201
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,760
dried and turned white.

202
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,959
The cut areas have also sealed,

203
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:03,480
indicating that the plant is ready to be

204
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,480
repotted into the new growing medium.

205
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,040
Step four, I plant the orchid in a new,

206
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,040
thoroughly cleaned pot.

207
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,920
A clean pot helps minimize bacteria and

208
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,240
provides the best conditions for the

209
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:26,680
orchid roots to attach to the growing

210
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,680
medium and grow healthily.

211
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,720
Then I add the prepared growing medium

212
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,399
into the pot to replant the orchid. It's

213
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,720
important to arrange the medium evenly

214
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,370
and loosely so the roots can easily

215
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:57,389

After planting, I use a small support

220
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,880
stick to secure the plant in place.

221
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,560
This helps the plant stay upright and

222
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,399
prevents the base from shifting,

223
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,880
creating favorable conditions for new

224
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:38,120

I spread a bit of moss over the surface

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,839
of the pot. This layer helps retain

229
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,920
moisture in the growing medium while

230
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,079
also creating a natural breathable
