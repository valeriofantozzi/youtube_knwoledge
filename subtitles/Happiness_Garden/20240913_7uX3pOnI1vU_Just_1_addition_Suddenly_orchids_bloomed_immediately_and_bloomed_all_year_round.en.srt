00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:29,895
welcome to my channel

2
00:00:33,894 --> 00:00:39,893
After purchasing the orchid, the orchid has finished blooming 

3
00:00:39,893 --> 00:00:45,891
and entered the withering stage of the flower branch

4
00:00:52,890 --> 00:01:00,888
Don't rush to throw it away. Let me share how they can thrive and continue to bloom

5
00:01:05,887 --> 00:01:10,886
Remove old orchid pots

6
00:01:17,885 --> 00:01:23,884
Then cut off all damaged roots

7
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:43,880
This helps the roots branch quickly and not rot.

8
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:12,874
When transplanted into a new pot, these branched roots will grow very strongly

9
00:02:22,023 --> 00:02:30,871
But if we don't replant it in a new pot, those branched roots will rot very quickly.

10
00:02:57,899 --> 00:03:03,897
Now I plant it in this new pot

11
00:03:05,897 --> 00:03:10,896
OH! Mischievous cat. Do you like cats??

12
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:19,894
I plant with fine pine bark

13
00:03:29,892 --> 00:03:36,891
When planted with small pine bark and moss When watering, water will drain slowly

14
00:03:45,023 --> 00:03:52,888
Therefore, we only water when the substrate is no longer waterlogged.

15
00:03:57,887 --> 00:04:03,885
Because watering too much will cause the roots to rot

16
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:45,877
After planting, fertilize the orchids

17
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:59,874
Take 1 onion and peel it

18
00:05:02,317 --> 00:05:08,873
Onions contain many useful vitamins.

19
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:15,871
Potassium, calcium, iron, phosphorus, diaphragm.

20
00:05:15,871 --> 00:05:20,870
Very good for the growth of orchids

21
00:05:51,897 --> 00:05:59,896
Then take the onion peel and put it in a jar

22
00:06:07,894 --> 00:06:13,893
Add 500ml boiled water

23
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:28,890
Cover and let the water cool before using as fertilizer

24
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:36,888
then take 20ml of milk

25
00:06:40,081 --> 00:06:46,886
Mix with 2 liters of water at room temperature

26
00:06:59,017 --> 00:07:02,750
1. Clean the leaves

27
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:07,882
Use soft cotton to absorb this water

28
00:07:08,016 --> 00:07:16,880
and gently wipe each leaf

29
00:07:20,013 --> 00:07:26,879
Milk has antiseptic properties, helping to kill fungi and insects that harm orchids

30
00:07:30,011 --> 00:07:36,877
and calcium supplementation is an important factor in forming the cell structure of plants, 

31
00:07:38,296 --> 00:07:44,875
Helps increase strength and resistance.

32
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:55,873
Thoroughly wipe the top and bottom of the leaf

33
00:08:04,871 --> 00:08:10,870
Because the underside is where fungi and insects live, causing harm to orchids

34
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:23,867
Do this 1-2 times a month to protect the orchid

35
00:08:34,898 --> 00:08:40,897
After the water cools, filter to get the onion juice.

36
00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:50,895
Onion peels contain many essential nutrients such as potassium, phosphorus, and calcium 

37
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:56,894
and organic compounds that are beneficial for plant growth. 

38
00:08:57,027 --> 00:09:03,893
In particular, potassium is very important for the flowering process, 

39
00:09:04,892 --> 00:09:10,891
helping orchids bloom more beautifully and sustainably.

40
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:17,890
2. Apply liquid fertilizer to the roots

41
00:09:20,023 --> 00:09:26,888
Water each orchid pot with this water every 2 weeks

42
00:09:29,038 --> 00:09:36,886
Onion peels are rich in antioxidants and compounds that have natural antifungal properties. 

43
00:09:37,886 --> 00:09:43,885
Helps protect plants from fungal attacks. 

44
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:50,883
This is useful for keeping orchids healthy and avoiding disease.

45
00:09:53,062 --> 00:10:00,881
As milk is decomposed, it helps grow beneficial microorganisms in the soil. 

46
00:10:00,881 --> 00:10:08,880
These microorganisms can help improve soil structure and provide nutrients to orchid roots.

47
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:16,878
Soak in this water for 20 minutes for better results

48
00:10:18,878 --> 00:10:25,876
Pour the remaining water into the jar

49
00:10:43,006 --> 00:10:48,872
3. Foliar fertilization for orchids

50
00:10:51,005 --> 00:10:56,870
Spray the top and bottom of the leaves thoroughly

51
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:06,868
Milk helps prevent some fungal and viral diseases when used as a spray solution on orchid leaves or roots. 

52
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:16,900
The protein layer in milk creates a protective barrier against the invasion of harmful bacteria.

53
00:11:22,898 --> 00:11:29,897
Then place the orchid in a cool, well-lit place to take care of it

54
00:11:31,413 --> 00:11:38,895
Normally, you only water orchids when the growing medium is dry

55
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:48,893
Or spray mist on the leaves and entire orchid to help keep the plant moist

56
00:11:53,389 --> 00:12:00,891
Use the remaining water to water other orchids in the garden

57
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:12,888
Milk helps improve the water-holding capacity of soil or orchid growing medium, 

58
00:12:12,888 --> 00:12:16,888
Helps plants avoid water shortage.

59
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:26,886
Onion peels, when decomposing, will help create favorable conditions for beneficial microorganisms in the soil to grow. 

60
00:12:28,885 --> 00:12:36,884
This helps improve soil structure and the plant's root system, increasing its ability to absorb nutrients.

61
00:12:49,881 --> 00:12:52,880
Results after 1 month

62
00:12:58,012 --> 00:13:03,878
Orchids are very sturdy and healthy

63
00:13:06,878 --> 00:13:12,877
The leaves are greener and harder than before

64
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:20,875
Many new roots develop, helping the plant absorb nutrients through the roots most effectively

65
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:30,873
Many new flower buds are formed

66
00:13:44,870 --> 00:14:00,867
I continue to care for the orchids with onion peel and milk

67
00:14:02,794 --> 00:14:09,899
And I expose the orchids to more sunlight so the flowers can bloom brilliantly

68
00:14:30,894 --> 00:14:35,893
Results after 2 month

69
00:14:38,893 --> 00:14:46,891
Orchids have bloomed many brilliant flowers

70
00:14:49,365 --> 00:14:55,889
With this simple way you can care for orchids at home and bloom all year round

71
00:15:01,888 --> 00:15:06,887
