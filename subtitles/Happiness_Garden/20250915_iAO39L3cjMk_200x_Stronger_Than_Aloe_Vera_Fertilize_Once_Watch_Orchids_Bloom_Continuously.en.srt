If you want your orchids to grow well

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,719
and bloom year round with vibrant

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,720
colors, take care to promote strong root

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,600
development. That way, the plant will

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,160
absorb more nutrients. In this video, I

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,800
will share simple, easy to do, but very

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,720
effective steps to achieve that. Please

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,390
watch the video carefully so you don't

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:37,120

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,600
To make natural fertilizer for orchids

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,079
yourself, you only need one banana. You

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,600
can use either a green or a ripe one.

17
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,280
The banana will provide plenty of

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,079
nutrients to help the plant stay healthy

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,079
and bloom more easily.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,199
Slice the banana into very thin pieces

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,199
uh so the nutrients dissolve more easily

22
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,120
during fermentation. allowing the

23
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:05,470
natural fertilizer to break down faster

24
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,119
and be absorbed better by the plant.

31
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,159
Then put the sliced banana into a clean

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,520
glass jar to start the fertilizer

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,520
fermentation process.

34
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,759
Next, pour about four cups of water into

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,759
the jar, which is equivalent to one

36
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,759

37
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,040
To help the fermentation process happen

38
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,119
faster and prevent the banana from

39
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,119

57
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,599
On the jar lid, make a small ventilation

58
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,920
hole so that the gas produced during

59
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:15,200
fermentation can escape, preventing the

60
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,440
jar from bursting.

61
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,599
Then place the jar in a cool, airy spot

62
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,599
for about 2 to 3 weeks for the mixture

63
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,599
to ferment completely and be ready to

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,599
use.

65
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,519
And here's the result. After about 2

66
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,920
weeks of fermentation, the banana has

67
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,920
completely softened, ensuring the

68
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,360
nutrients are fully dissolved and ready

four cups of water, equivalent to about

74
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:58,680

77
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,919
Method one, fertilize the orchid roots

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,079
directly with the liquid solution made

79
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,400

82
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,600
Simply water each orchid pot with about

83
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,520
10 tablespoons of this solution, which

84
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,140
is enough to ensure the plant receives

85
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:46,479
sufficient nutrients without any waste.

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,320
provides plenty of natural vitamins and

89
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,040
minerals, helping the orchids leaves and

90
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,880

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,360
keeping the flower colors vibrant for

92
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,720

fermented bananas helps orchid roots

97
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,600
grow strong, firm, and healthy. When the

98
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,600
roots are healthy, the plant can absorb

99
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,080
more nutrients from the soil or growing

100
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,080

101
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,080
the ability to bloom consistently year

Using liquid fertilizer from fermented

bananas also helps improve the structure

106

of the soil or orchid growing medium,

107
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,880
making the environment around the roots

108
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,560
more loose and airy. This not only

109
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:47,160
supports root development but also

110
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,160
prevents root rot or fungal diseases.

Additionally, the fermented banana

113
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,600
mixture stimulates the growth of

114
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,759
beneficial microorganisms in the soil,

115
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,199
creating a biological balance and

116
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,600
promoting the natural breakdown of

117
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,520
nutrients. As a result, the orchid

118
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,960
absorbs nutrients more effectively and

119
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,960

you can put the fermented banana mixture

directly onto the orchid's leaves and

124
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,600

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,680
absorb nutrients quickly through the

And here is the result. You can see that

194
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:20,200
the orchid leaves are well protected,

195
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,200
always fresh, glossy, and healthy.

196
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,200
Besides staying fresh, the leaves also

197
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,560
become firmer, helping the plant

198
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,800
withstand light sunlight and

199
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,800
environmental factors while providing a

200
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,780
solid foundation for the orchid to grow

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,360
The newly developed roots are very

204
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,120
strong, thick, and firm, helping the

205
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,959
plant absorb more nutrients, thereby

206
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:01,000
promoting overall growth and preparing

207
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,000
for upcoming flower buds.

208
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,720
These healthy roots also help the plant

209
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,480
anchor firmly to the growing medium,

210
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,720
providing stability and reducing the

211
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,560
risk of falling or damage, creating a

212
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,040
solid foundation for the long-term

213
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,040
growth of the orchid.

215
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,680
And so with strong roots, the orchid

216
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,000
will absorb nutrients optimally, grow

217
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,240
balanced from roots to leaves, and be

218
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,839
ready for the next vibrant blooms. This

219
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,000
is the essential foundation for the

220
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:45,000
orchid to stay healthy, and bloom

221
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000

The potassium in bananas helps orchids

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,600
resist drought very effectively. Thanks

better from the roots to the stems,

227
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,800
leaves, and flowers, helping the blooms

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,640
last longer, maintain vibrant colors,

229
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,279
and reduce the risk of wilting or

230
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,279
premature fading.

231
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,760
Potassium also stimulates the orchid to

232
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,600
produce more flower buds, helping the

233
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,170
plant bloom consistently and increasing
