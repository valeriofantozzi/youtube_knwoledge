Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:13,898
If you have an orchid that has rot causing the leaves to turn yellow.

3
00:00:16,897 --> 00:00:26,895
So don't rush to throw it away. I will share how to revive it quickly and easily.

4
00:00:37,367 --> 00:00:48,891
This orchid may be suffering from inorganic fertilizer shock leading to root rot causing the leaves to turn yellow.

5
00:00:56,299 --> 00:01:06,887
So I need to check the roots to cut off all damaged roots.

6
00:01:26,883 --> 00:01:36,881
Removing damaged roots helps prevent the rot from spreading, causing the entire root of the orchid to rot.

7
00:01:44,663 --> 00:01:54,878
and stimulates new root formation faster.

8
00:02:03,876 --> 00:02:12,874
Then rinse with water.

9
00:02:42,868 --> 00:02:52,900
Take 2 liters of water and put it in a jar.

10
00:03:02,898 --> 00:03:12,896
Then add 1 teaspoon of Baking Soda to help kill bacteria and eliminate pests.

11
00:03:26,893 --> 00:03:36,891
Soak orchid roots in this water for 10 minutes.

12
00:03:56,887 --> 00:04:06,885
Then use dry moss to grow orchids.

13
00:04:09,884 --> 00:04:19,882
After soaking for 10 minutes, take the orchid out and plant it.

14
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:36,879
When planting dry, sterilized moss, it will help absorb moisture from the roots.

15
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:46,877
This helps the cut heal quickly and the rot does not spread further.

16
00:04:51,306 --> 00:05:01,874
Then place in a cool place and do not water for 1 week.

17
00:05:06,978 --> 00:05:16,871
After 1 week, start watering the orchid once a week.

18
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:44,899
Soak in water for 10 minutes to keep the moss moist.

19
00:05:50,898 --> 00:06:00,896
Then take it out and cover it with a transparent plastic box.

20
00:06:11,894 --> 00:06:21,892
And remember to water it every week to keep it moist.

21
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:36,889
1 MONTH LATER.

22
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:51,886
The orchid has revived and grown healthy roots.

23
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:15,881
But it seems like the leaves are a bit wilted.

24
00:07:20,747 --> 00:07:30,878
Once the root system is strong, you need to add more nutrients to help the orchid grow quickly.

25
00:07:35,877 --> 00:07:42,875
Take 2 liters of water.

26
00:07:52,874 --> 00:08:02,872
and add 5 teaspoons of rice.

27
00:08:07,235 --> 00:08:17,869
Rice contains a variety of minerals and amino acids that are important for orchid growth.

28
00:08:41,261 --> 00:08:51,895
Then use this rice water to water the orchids once a week..

29
00:09:03,893 --> 00:09:12,891
In addition to providing necessary nutrients,

30
00:09:12,891 --> 00:09:22,889
 rice water also creates a favorable environment for beneficial microorganisms to grow in orchid pots.

31
00:09:25,888 --> 00:09:33,887
Soak for 10 minutes then take out the orchid pot.

32
00:09:52,883 --> 00:10:02,881
Regularly spray mist to keep the soil moist when the growing medium is dry.

33
00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:34,875
2 MONTHS LATER.

34
00:10:48,294 --> 00:10:58,870
From an orchid with leaf rot causing the leaves to turn completely yellow, it has now grown healthily.

35
00:11:02,869 --> 00:11:12,867
Strong roots, fresh green leaves.

36
00:11:26,898 --> 00:11:36,896
