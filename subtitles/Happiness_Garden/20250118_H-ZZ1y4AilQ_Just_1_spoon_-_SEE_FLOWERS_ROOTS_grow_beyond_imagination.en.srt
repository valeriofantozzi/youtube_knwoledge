18
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,240
inevitable if it accidentally rots you

19
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,240
need to cut off the rotten part right

20
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,240

22
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:39,480

world um waste from rotten orchids

44
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,840
should be isolated from the garden as

45
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,840

[Music]

47
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,010
possible this is activated carbon it is

48
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:17,419
made from natural dry firewood

50
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,310
I took a piece of activated carbon like

51
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:45,370
this and grounded into powder

54
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,680
then sprinkle activated charcoal powder

55
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,040
on the newly cut wound helps Cuts heal

56
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,319
faster and eliminates fungal

57
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,600
diseases because activated carbon has a

58
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:19,600
very good sterilization function

61
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,880
then you sprinkle more in between the

62
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,880
two leaves and on the

63
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,639
base then put the Orchid pot in a cool

64
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:29,280
place and do not water for one week the

65
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,280
Orchid will recover from the disease

66
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,840

68
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:42,160

71
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,830

content of calcium and natural minerals
