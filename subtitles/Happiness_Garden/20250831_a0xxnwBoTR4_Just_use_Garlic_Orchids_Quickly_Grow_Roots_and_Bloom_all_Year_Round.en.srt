throw it away. In today's video, I will

share with you a simple but effective

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,920
way to help the plant recover and

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,000
continue to thrive.

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,600
If you see your orchid pot with wilted

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,840
leaves like this, don't be quick to

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,760
throw it away because behind that

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,000
fragile appearance, the plant still has

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,559
a chance to revive and bloom

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,960
beautifully.

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,520
First, you need to remove all the wilted

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,440
leaves, old leaves, and damaged leaves

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,640
so the plant can focus its energy on

27
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,400
nourishing the healthy parts.

[Music]

35
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,479
The next step is to completely cut off

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,400
the dried or rotten roots, keeping only

37
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:28,840
the firm and healthy ones to give the

38
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,840
plant a solid foundation for recovery.

39
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,079
That's my helper. Do you have any pets?

[Music]

41
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,159
Um, next I will cut off this old flower

42
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,000
spike. By removing the old spike, the

43
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,560
plant will no longer waste energy on the

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,310
useless part, but instead focus on

45
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,320
nourishing itself to recover faster.

[Music]

47
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,640
Uh, after careful inspection, I noticed

48
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,280
that the top of the plant still has the

49
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,520
potential to grow new leaves. This is a

50
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,889
sign that the plant is still alive and

51
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,959
can recover.

[Music]

53
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,520
After that, place the orchid pot in a

54
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,840
well ventilated spot for one day and

55
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,680
temporarily avoid watering so the cuts

56
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,970
have time to dry and the plant can

57
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:34,050
stabilize again.

58
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:34,050
[Music]

59
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,599
After that, take two cloves of garlic.

60
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,040
Garlic has antibacterial and

61
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,480
disinfecting properties and is

62
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,280
especially useful in supporting the

63
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,280
recovery of weak orchids.

64
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,720
Because garlic contains many natural

65
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,360
compounds that help prevent bacteria and

66
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:03,959
fungal diseases, it becomes a great ally

67
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,959
to protect and restore the orchid.

68
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,000
And now slice the garlic into very thin

69
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:14,040
pieces so that the nutrients can easily

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,040
dissolve and work more effectively.

73

Next, take about 20 g of aloe vera

74
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,920
leaves and cut them into thin slices.

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,519
Aloe vera will help provide moisture and

76
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,450
nutrients, supporting the orchid to

77
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:52,319
recover and grow quickly.

clean jar.

82
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,319
Next, add one liter of room temperature

83
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,080
water to the jar, allowing the

84
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,840
ingredients to blend and form a

85
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,080
nourishing solution for the orchid.

86
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,239
Then tightly close the jar and let it

87
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,079
sit for one day, allowing the nutrients

88
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,079
from the garlic and aloe vera to fully

89
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,079

After one day, stir the solution well

92
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,240
and then strain out the solids, keeping

93
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,170
only the clear liquid to use for caring

94
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:44,259
for the orchid.

97
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,320
Step one, use a soft cloth to soak up

98
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,800
this solution and gently wipe both the

99
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,479
top and bottom of the orchid leaves,

100
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,919
helping the nutrients penetrate deeply

101
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,919
and support recovery.

102
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,639
Wiping the leaves with the garlic and

103
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,720
aloe vera mixture helps remove dirt and

104
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,360
bacteria on the leaf surface, reducing

105
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,880
the risk of disease and creating a clean

106
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,800
environment for the leaves to

107
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,880
photosynthesize more effectively.

108
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,720
This mixture also provides moisture and

109
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,960
nutrients directly to the leaves,

110
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,880
helping them become healthy and glossy

111
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,199
and enhancing their ability to absorb

112
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,720
light uh thereby supporting the orchid's

113
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,880
recovery and growth.

114
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,039
Step two, pour the garlic and aloe vera

115
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,960

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,199

and roots.

118
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,199
Then evenly spray this mixture onto the

119
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,880
orchid stem, leaves, and roots, helping

120
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,120
to provide nutrients and protect the

121
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,600
plant from bacteria while promoting the

122
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,600
recovery process.

123
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,199
This provides nutrients directly while

124
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,199
also acting as an antibacterial

125
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:11,720

126
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,720

127
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,240
Step three, evenly water the roots and

128

growing medium with this mixture,

129
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,880

132
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,840
After watering, you can soak the orchid

133
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,400
pot in this mixture for about 5 to 10

134
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,560
minutes or longer depending on the water

I usually water every 3 to 5 days.

At the same time, misting the leaves

00:10:52,800 --> 00:11:00,200
grow strong, while the older leaves also

193
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,200
become greener and sturdier than before.

[Music]

195
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,279
Now I will cut across the orchid stem

196
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,519
just below where the roots grow along

197
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:19,560
the stem to plant it in a new pot and

198
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,560
help the plant grow more successfully.

[Music]

200
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,480
After that, I apply a little toothpaste

201
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,800
to the cut, helping it heal quickly and

202
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,800
prevent infection.

203
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:50,979

204
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:57,700
[Applause]

205
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,399
Then plant the orchid section just cut

206
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,000
from the mother stem into a new pot,

207
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,760
giving the plant space to grow and

208
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:23,680
recover better.

209
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:25,519
[Music]

210
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,760
The orchid growing medium is made up of

211
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,360
large pine bark and some moss, all

212
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,279
sterilized to provide a clean

213
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,279
environment supporting healthy orchid

214
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,279
growth.

215
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,399
Then carefully place the orchid into the

216
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,920
pot, ensuring the roots are evenly

217
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,200
spread on the growing medium so the

218
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,200
plant grows firmly.

219
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,970
[Music]

220
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,760
After planting, place the orchid pot in

221
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,519
a spot with gentle sunlight, ideally

222
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,200
morning sun from the east, helping the

223
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,720
plant photosynthesize and recover

224
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:11,880
faster.

225
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:11,880
[Music]

226
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,560
And here is the orchid pot that was once

227
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,639
rotting. But after applying this method,

228
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,040
the plant has fully recovered and is

229
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,200
growing healthily.

230
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,959
This is the lower part of the stem.

231
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,360
After cutting across the mother stem,

232
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,040
since it no longer has the growth tip, a

233
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,020
new orchid has sprouted from the

234
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:38,720
horizontal part of the mother stem.

235
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:40,720
[Music]

236
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,200
And this is the upper part of the mother

237
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:47,140
plant. It has grown many new leaves and

238
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:49,680
is very healthy, full of vitality.

239
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,880
[Music]

240
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,360
What do you think about the way I

241
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,880
revived this rotting orchid? Don't

242
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,160
hesitate to leave a comment and share

243
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:01,600
your thoughts. I'm eager to hear your

244
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,680
feedback and experiences.

245
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,760
By caring for each plant individually,

246
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,000
step by step, over time you will have a

247
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,760
garden full of vibrant orchid blooms.

248
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,399
The patience you show today will bring

249
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,399
abundant joy tomorrow.

250
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,839
Start with each small orchid pot.

251
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,760
Gradually, through years of persistent

252
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,000
care, you will transform your garden

253
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,800
into a paradise full of vibrant orchid

254
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,800
blooms and vitality.
