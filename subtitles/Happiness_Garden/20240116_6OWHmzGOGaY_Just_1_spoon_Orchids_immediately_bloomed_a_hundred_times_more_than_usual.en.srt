Welcome to my channel Happiness Garden.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,899
First I poured 3 liters of water into the jar.

3
00:00:10,765 --> 00:00:19,897
And join us in discovering the magical power of Cocacola.

4
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:31,894
Using Coca-Cola helps stimulate flowering without requiring too much care.

5
00:00:50,057 --> 00:00:58,214
Take 50ml of Coca-Cola.

6
00:00:59,363 --> 00:01:13,878
Then you just need to mix coca-cola with water and you can use it right away.

7
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:32,016
Then you clean the surface of the orchid leaves with this coca-cola.

8
00:01:48,984 --> 00:02:02,249
Wipe both the top and bottom of the leaves.

9
00:02:10,684 --> 00:02:25,051
This way helps to repel insects and fungi on leaves very well.

10
00:02:32,582 --> 00:02:45,293
Do it once every 2 weeks, orchid leaves will be very well protected.

11
00:03:21,894 --> 00:03:41,721
You can also use this water to spray the entire orchid.

12
00:03:52,765 --> 00:04:04,752
Pay attention to spray carefully the underside of leaves and between leaves.

13
00:04:05,026 --> 00:04:15,017
because insects and fungi often congregate there.

14
00:04:16,686 --> 00:04:26,681
This is also done every 2 weeks.

15
00:04:29,094 --> 00:04:39,079
if you use the wiping and spraying method of coca-cola regularly,

16
00:04:40,078 --> 00:04:51,268
Leaves will always be green because they are not damaged by insects and fungi.

17
00:04:52,771 --> 00:05:01,463
like my orchid.

18
00:05:01,463 --> 00:05:12,404
Leaves are always green and healthy.

19
00:05:14,423 --> 00:05:20,160
Now take care of the roots.

20
00:05:20,937 --> 00:05:31,280
You just need to water this orchid as much as possible.

21
00:05:33,475 --> 00:05:45,991
Coca-Cola contains phosphoric acid which has a mild bleaching effect.

22
00:05:46,965 --> 00:05:57,624
so it will eliminate fungal diseases in pots and roots very well.

23
00:06:00,047 --> 00:06:12,027
In addition, Coca-Cola also has the ability to kill some insects that damage plant roots such as:

24
00:06:12,027 --> 00:06:18,111
snails and cockroaches are very good.

25
00:06:21,886 --> 00:06:31,523
Coca-Cola helps neutralize the acid in the pot when you use too much chemical fertilizer.

26
00:06:34,075 --> 00:06:42,332
balance pH in orchid pots.

27
00:06:43,956 --> 00:06:53,864
This will stimulate new root growth.

28
00:06:56,622 --> 00:07:05,314
Coca-Cola contains sugar that helps flowers grow very well.

29
00:07:06,584 --> 00:07:16,232
If combined with organic fertilizers, it will help spread more flowers.

30
00:07:21,886 --> 00:07:31,794
My orchids when applying this method have grown a lot of flower branches on one tree.

31
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:10,361
The sugar in coca-cola helps flowers stay fresh and long-lasting.

32
00:08:11,732 --> 00:08:21,701
Orchid after blooming will not be exhausted.

33
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:34,332
Orchid can bloom continuously from one batch to another.

34
00:08:48,258 --> 00:08:56,776
New roots are always growing.

35
00:08:59,663 --> 00:09:10,006
Helps orchids absorb the most nutrients.

36
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:36,420
