00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:51,890
To make this compost I recycle chicken bones into fertilizer.

7
00:00:55,889 --> 00:01:05,887
First, wash the chicken bones several times with water

8
00:01:09,887 --> 00:01:19,885
Chicken bones are rich in potassium and calcium.

9
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:32,437
These are all very benign substances and have very good effects for the growth and development of orchids.

10
00:01:32,882 --> 00:01:42,880
Using chicken bones as fertilizer will help you take care of orchids more effectively.

11
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:56,877
Wash the chicken bones and dry them crispy at low temperature.

12
00:02:16,873 --> 00:02:26,871
After the chicken bones are dry and crispy, they will be ground into powder.

13
00:03:31,892 --> 00:03:41,890
Take 1 tablespoon of chicken bone powder and put it in a jar.

14
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:55,887
Then soak with 2 liters of water.

15
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:17,011
Wait a day before using.

16
00:04:20,882 --> 00:04:30,880
The remainder is stored for use in the next batch.

17
00:04:43,878 --> 00:04:48,877
A DAY LATER.

18
00:04:50,896 --> 00:04:55,875
Filter out residue.

19
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:22,870
FIRST METHOD.

20
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:35,867
Water this fertilizer solution on the orchid roots.

21
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:51,897
Chicken bones contain many minerals and organic substances that help provide nutrition for orchids.

22
00:05:56,896 --> 00:06:06,894
It contains nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus which are important for orchid growth.

23
00:06:12,893 --> 00:06:22,891
Potassium helps flower development and resists drought very well.

24
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:36,889
Phosphorus helps roots grow quickly. Nitrogen will help develop orchid stems and leaves.

25
00:06:50,886 --> 00:06:55,885
NEXT METHOD

26
00:07:06,883 --> 00:07:16,881
Spray this fertilizer on the entire orchid.

27
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:31,944
Spray the top and bottom of the leaves thoroughly

28
00:07:35,877 --> 00:07:45,875
Spray seedlings to help them grow faster.

29
00:07:54,873 --> 00:08:04,871
Spraying the roots will stimulate many branches.

30
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:26,900
RESULT

31
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:39,898
After 1-2 months of applying this fertilizer, many roots and branches grow.

32
00:08:51,895 --> 00:09:01,893
Potassium in chicken bones helps prevent flower buds from wilting.

33
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:26,888
The flowers bloom more brightly than usual.

34
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:42,885
The flowers stay on the branches for a long time before fading.

35
00:09:51,236 --> 00:09:58,882
