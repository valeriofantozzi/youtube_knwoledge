00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,227
Welcome to my Happiness Garden channel.

2
00:00:34,945 --> 00:00:44,925
If you plant a lot of orchids, the spread of rotten orchids due to bacteria or fungi is unavoidable.

3
00:00:47,846 --> 00:00:57,822
In this video I show you how to get your rotten orchid to recover and grow quickly.

4
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:11,753
First, check if the roots are healthy.

5
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:52,571
This orchid of mine has all roots damaged.

6
00:01:52,571 --> 00:02:03,213
so I will cut all the rotten part from the orchid.

7
00:02:10,773 --> 00:02:22,739
Then rinse with water.

8
00:02:45,556 --> 00:02:57,565
then wipe dry.

9
00:03:17,607 --> 00:03:32,837
Apply toothpaste on the cut.

10
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:48,189
This helps the cut heal faster and protects the orchid from rot.

11
00:03:55,923 --> 00:04:03,919
Take 1 aloe leaf.

12
00:04:14,317 --> 00:04:24,315
sliced.

13
00:04:52,333 --> 00:05:02,307
Add 1 teaspoon of honey.

14
00:05:11,827 --> 00:05:20,383
Add 500ml of water at room temperature.

15
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:31,527
Stir well so that the nutrients from the aloe vera gel and honey dissolve into the water.

16
00:05:50,831 --> 00:06:01,262
Soak orchid branches in this water for 30 minutes.

17
00:06:21,496 --> 00:06:29,832
Put 500ml of warm water in the bottle.

18
00:06:30,272 --> 00:06:40,860
add 1 teaspoon of cinnamon powder.

19
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:07,591
Allow 30 minutes for the drug to dissolve in water to be used.

20
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:40,637
After 30 minutes of soaking, filter out the residue.

21
00:07:54,876 --> 00:08:15,261
Soak moss in cinnamon water for 30 minutes.

22
00:08:50,186 --> 00:09:00,160
Put the orchid in a bottle and mist it to keep it moist every 5 days.

23
00:09:11,561 --> 00:09:18,097
Put in a cool place to wait for the orchid to take root.

24
00:09:26,143 --> 00:09:32,278
1 MONTH LATER.

25
00:09:35,546 --> 00:09:45,518
With this simple way, after 1 month the orchid has taken root

26
00:09:51,812 --> 00:09:59,782
Roots grow very healthy.

27
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:19,644

28
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:34,142
Now I will plant it in a pot so that the orchid can grow in the outside environment.

29
00:10:46,795 --> 00:10:52,986
Plastic seeds for growing hydroponic vegetables are placed at the bottom of the pot.

30
00:10:54,971 --> 00:11:04,886
On the face is moss to help retain moisture better.

31
00:11:24,396 --> 00:11:34,363
After planting, water and care like other normal plants.

32
00:11:35,422 --> 00:11:44,394
Hope the video will help you a lot.

33
00:11:46,894 --> 00:11:55,892
And don't rush to leave because in the next part of the video I share extremely effective tips for recovering rotten orchids.

34
00:12:04,642 --> 00:12:11,622
Today I will show you how to revive a rotten orchid like this.

35
00:12:11,622 --> 00:12:22,620
When the orchid has withered all the leaves, only the stem and roots remain, do not rush to throw it away.

36
00:12:50,615 --> 00:12:56,614
Here are still fresh roots.

37
00:12:56,614 --> 00:13:22,608
First, cut off all damaged, rotten roots.

38
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:56,602
Apply a molten candle on the cut so that the water does not penetrate the tree.

39
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:33,628
Use 2 teaspoons of cinnamon powder.

40
00:14:41,626 --> 00:15:03,622
Add 1 liter of boiled water.

41
00:15:08,621 --> 00:15:18,619
Close the lid and wait for the water to cool.

42
00:15:22,618 --> 00:15:31,616
The water has cooled down

43
00:15:31,616 --> 00:16:07,609
Filter out residue.

44
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:28,605
Soak orchids in this water for 30 minutes.

45
00:16:34,604 --> 00:17:11,630
The rest of the water I will spray on other orchids to help protect the orchid from insects and fungal diseases

46
00:17:14,629 --> 00:17:25,627
After soaking for 30 minutes, plant it.

47
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:43,623
Using pine bark and dry pumice stone to plant will help absorb moisture in the roots, making the orchid roots not rot.

48
00:17:43,623 --> 00:17:49,622
Add some dry moss on the face.

49
00:17:49,622 --> 00:17:54,621
Put in a cool and well-lit place for 7 days

50
00:17:54,621 --> 00:18:06,619
After 7 days, you can spray water to keep the plants moist.

51
00:18:12,618 --> 00:18:21,616
Cover with a clear, vented plastic container and wait for the plant to revive.

52
00:18:23,616 --> 00:18:30,614
AFTER 3 WEEKS,

53
00:18:30,614 --> 00:18:37,613
A sprout has sprouted,

54
00:18:37,613 --> 00:18:48,611
Spray water once every 5 days to keep the sprouts moist

55
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:55,609
AFTER 2 MONTHS

56
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:26,603
