Welcome back to Happiness Garden.

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,879
Orchids are special plants that require

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,839
proper care to thrive and bloom

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,839
beautifully all year round.

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,280
Today, I'll guide you on how to make

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,119
natural fertilizer using simple, easy to

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,660

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:24,720

This method is not only budget friendly,

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,279
but also incredibly safe for your

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,279

Let's dive in and get started.

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,520
Today I used coffee grounds to make

16
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:50,109
natural fertilizer.

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,559
The next ingredient I used is eggshells

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,559

Coffee grounds provide nitrogen for lush

The mild acidity of coffee grounds pairs

31
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,119
with the alkalinity of eggshells to

32
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,119
create a balanced pH suitable for

33
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,119

Let's get started.

222
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:58,480
This is one of the orchid pots that once

223
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:01,040
had rotting leaves, was wilted, and weak

224
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,959
after blooming. I bought it at a very

225
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,760
low price from a local flower shop

226
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,920
during a clearance sale.

227
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,920
Although it looked exhausted, I believed

228
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,320
that with just a bit of patience and

229
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:16,870
love, the plant could still be revived

230
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:19,920
and come back more radiant than before.

[Music]

232
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,760
Since this orchid has been planted for

233
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,000
quite a long time, the first step we

234
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,340
need to take is to remove all the old

235
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,720
growing medium.

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,800
This helps eliminate any remaining

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,639
pathogens and creates the best

239
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,550
conditions for new roots to grow

240
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,990

As you can see, the entire root system

244
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,320
of this orchid has been completely

245
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,079
damaged. This is the reason why the

246
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,079
plant couldn't absorb water and

247
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:15,959
nutrients, leading to wilting and

248
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,959
weakening after blooming.

250
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,199
We need to gently trim off all the old

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,360
simply take 100 ml of clean water and

280
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,360
pour it into a cup.

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,520

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,840

286
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,940

old stem of the orchid in this solution

291
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,480
for about 20 to 30 minutes. This gently

292
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,160
disinfects the plant while also

293
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,510
providing nutrients to stimulate the

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:14,740

After securing the plant in the foam,

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,960
place the entire setup into a clear

If you face any difficulties during the

382
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,880
orchid growing process, don't hesitate

383
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,400
to leave a comment. I'm always ready to

384
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,440
support you so you can grow healthy

385
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,440
orchids that bloom beautifully.

[Music]

387
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,520
Now I will plant the orchid in a new pot

388
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,120
so it can grow in an outdoor

389
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:53,180
environment.

390

[Music]

391
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,799
At the bottom of the pot, I place a few

392
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:02,760
small pieces of foam to improve air flow

393
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,760
and help with better drainage.

394
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,799
On top of the foam layer, I spread a

395
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,200
layer of hydroponic planting pellets.

396
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:13,279
This layer helps retain moisture,

397
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,440
provides air flow, and creates a clean

398
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,910
environment where orchid roots can grow

399
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,760
easily without becoming suffocated.

00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:22,000
[Music]

401
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,640
On top, I cover with a layer of moss to

402
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,200
naturally retain moisture for the plant.

403
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,440
This moss layer helps maintain stable

404
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,039
humidity while creating a soft and root

405
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,390
friendly environment for new roots to

406
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:36,320
grow.

407
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:38,799
[Music]

408
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,520
Then, gently place the orchid into the

409
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:44,159
pot and remember to secure the stem with

410
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,919
a support stick. This stabilization

411
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,760
helps the plant stay upright and

412
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,110
prevents movement during the rooting and

413
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,279
recovery process.

414
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:53,200
[Music]

415
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,960
Only water to maintain moisture when you

416
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,279
see the growing medium starting to dry

417
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,520
out. Moderate humidity will help new

418
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:02,840
roots develop steadily and stay healthy

419
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,840
over time.

420
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,679
Keep in mind orchids need water to grow,

421
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,679
but they also tolerate drought quite

422
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,080
well. Overwatering can easily lead to

423
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,080
root rot. So, always maintain just the

424
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:21,720
right amount of moisture, not too wet

425
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,720
and not too dry.

426
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,799
Only when the roots have started to

427
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,360
firmly attach to the growing medium

428
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:31,600
should you begin fertilizing the orchid.

429
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,760
At this stage, the plant is stable and

430
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,760
ready to absorb nutrients for stronger

431
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,760
growth.

432
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,559
Place the orchid pot in a spot with

433
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,480
gentle cool sunlight. A soft morning

434
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,720
light will support good photosynthesis

435
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,000
and naturally encourage root growth and

436
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,380
sprouting.

438
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,760
Each time you patiently revive a plant

439
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,080
over time, you'll gradually create a

440
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,240
beautiful garden like mine where orchid

441
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,700
blooms flourish in all four seasons,

442
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:08,080
bringing joy and peace every day.

It helps brighten up your living space,

445
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,799
making it more vibrant and full of life.

446
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,640
Each blooming flower is not only the

447
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:21,360
result of care, but also a spiritual

448
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:22,880
gift that nurtures daily joy.

449
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,320
Thank you for joining me on the journey

450
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:28,799
of caring for and reviving orchid pots

451
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,480
that once seemed lifeless.

452
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,240
I hope you carry with you plenty of

453
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,679
inspiration and confidence to start

454
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,279
nurturing your own little garden.
