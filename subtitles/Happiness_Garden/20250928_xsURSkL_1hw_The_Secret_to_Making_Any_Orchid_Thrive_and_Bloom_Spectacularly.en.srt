3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,880
all year round, today I'll share a

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,880
simple and effective way to make natural

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,359
Let's get started.

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,360
Let's get started.

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:49,640
To make this fertilizer, I took an apple

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,640
and cut it into small pieces.

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,199
Remove damaged apple parts. This will

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,199
not affect the quality of natural

20
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,199

31
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,119
Apples contain nutrients like potassium,

32
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,479
phosphorus, and trace elements which

33
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,479
help orchids grow healthily.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,400
Apples enhance root development and

35
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,400
stimulate flowering.

36
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,060
Additionally, apples help improve the

orchids to absorb nutrients.

41
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,519
Put the apples in a jar and pour in one

42
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,519
liter of water. About four cups of

43
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,519
water.

44
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,239
Then add five tablespoons of rice.

45
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,519
And add two teaspoons of wine yeast.

46
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,000
Then stir the mixture well.

47
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,040

50
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,360
fermented 3 weeks ago.

51
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:17,080
Then take about 50 mm, three spoons of

52
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,080
this fermented fertilizer.

rot from spreading to healthy parts.

63
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,800
It also stops wasting energy on

64
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:05,320
unhealthy parts. This creates a better

65
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,320
environment for new roots to grow.

66
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,919
Um, I keep these unflowered nodes to

67
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,919
stimulate them to bloom again.

68
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,800
For buds that have finished blooming,

69
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,800
cut them off.

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:24,039
Uh cutting again to prevent the cut from

71
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,039
being crushed will limit rot in the cut.

72
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,759
Then apply cinnamon powder to the cut to

73
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,759
help the wound heal quickly.

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,240
Step one.

75
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,440
Water the roots with this liquid

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:49,160
improves the orchid's health, and

83
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,160
enhances its flowering ability.

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,519
The beneficial microorganisms in the

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,120
fertilizer also improve the soil

86
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,720
environment, making it easier for the

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,360
Step two.

89
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,680
Now, thoroughly wipe the top and bottom

90
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,240

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,200
Wiping the top and bottom of the orchid

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,279
This makes the plant healthier, improves

Spraying the liquid fertilizer solution

109

on the orchid provides direct nutrients

110
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,000
to the leaves and stems, stimulating

111
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:54,440

112
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,440
promoting overall plant health.

113
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,720
It also helps the orchid absorb

114
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,040
nutrients quickly, improves its

115
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,519
resistance to diseases, and supports the

116
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,519
blooming process.

excess solution left on the orchid

121
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,480
leaves.

122
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,440
Wiping off any excess solution helps

123
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,680
prevent fungal issues or leaf burn leaf

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,800
burn caused by the fertilizer solution

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,800
being exposed to direct sunlight.

126
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,600
It also helps the leaves dry faster,

127
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,279
preventing the creation of a moist

128
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,399

substrate.

139
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,079
Planting with shredded pine bark helps

140
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,600
with good drainage, but still creates

141
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:31,440
enough moisture for orchids to grow

142
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,440
without being water logged.

143
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,680
When growing orchids, you need to

144
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,680
observe the time to water them.

145
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,160
Observe the roots. Silver gray means

146
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,079
they need watering. Check the soil

147
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,000
moisture. The leaves show signs of

148
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:56,360
wrinkling. The pot is lighter than

149
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,360
normal. And water in the morning.

150
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,399

Goodbye and see you in the next video.

195
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,000
Welcome everyone to my beloved little

196
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,839
garden where I share simple yet

197
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,839
heartfelt things for my beautiful orchid

198
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,839
pots.

199
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,919
Today I will share with you how to make

200
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,799
a simple natural fertilizer at home to

201
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:21,280
help restore the or the orchid after it

202
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,520
has finished blooming so the plant can

203
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:27,000
continue to grow healthily and prepare

204
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,000
for the next blooming.

205
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,080
Um you can see that my orchid has many

206
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,039
spent flower stems but don't worry it's

207
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:38,440
a normal sign and we can help the plant

208
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,440
recover better.

209
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,320
We need to remove all the wilted petals

210
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,320
so the plant can focus its energy on

211
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,799
developing roots and leaves, preparing

212
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,799
for the next blooming.

214
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,000
[Music]

215
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,320
The unopened buds can be stimulated to

216
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,240
produce new flower stems here, helping

217
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,559
the plant bloom continuously throughout

218
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,240
the year.

219
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,640
As for the buds that have already

220
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,919
bloomed, they cannot bloom again. So, we

221
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,240
just need to take good care of the

222
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,240
remaining buds.

223
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:30,369
[Music]

224
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,440
Next, take about 250 ml of water into a

225
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,440
cup.

226
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:48,480
[Music]

227
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,840
Next, you need to prepare baking soda.

228
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,320
This is the main ingredient that helps

229
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:57,080
adjust the pH in the orchid pot and

230
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,080
prevent some harmful fungi and bacteria.

231
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:07,039
Just about a/ teaspoon of baking soda is

232
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,640
enough. No need for too much as we only

233
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,880
need the right amount to achieve the

234
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,880
desired effect without harming the

235
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,880
plant.

236
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,679
Next, you need neem oil. Neem oil helps

237
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,280
repel insects and prevent bacterial and

238
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:29,559
fungal diseases, helping to protect the

239
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,559
orchid plant and keep it healthy.

240
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,799
Just one teaspoon of neem oil is enough.

241
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,559
This amount of oil will create an

242
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,039
effective solution without overloading

243
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,880
the plant.

244
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,880
Stir well to ensure that the neem oil

245
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,280
and baking soda dissolve completely into

246
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,679
the water, creating a uniform solution

247
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,679
ready to use.

248
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,120
[Music]

249
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,360
Step one, use a soft cloth to soak up

250
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,919
this mixture and gently wipe both the

251
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,799
top and bottom of the leaves, helping to

252
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:08,760
remove dust and small insects while also

253
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,760
protecting the leaves from diseases.

254
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,300
[Music]

255
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,799
Neem oil can help maintain the natural

256
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,880
moisture of the leaves, preventing them

257
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:22,440
from drying out and keeping the leaves

258
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,440
soft and fresh.

259
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,559
The combination of baking soda and neem

260
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,320
oil not only helps remove insects, but

261
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,320
also creates a protective layer on the

262
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:50,360
leaves, helping the plant effectively

263
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,360
resist pests and diseases.

264
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:14,080
After wiping the leaves, pour this

265
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,760
mixture into a spray bottle. Make sure

266
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,760
the spray bottle is clean and ready to

267
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,559
spray evenly on the leaves and the

268
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,559
orchid's growing medium.

269
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:39,760
After wiping the leaves, pour this

270
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,520
mixture into a spray bottle. Make sure

271
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,440
the spray bottle is clean and ready to

272
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:47,240
spray evenly on the leaves and the

273
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,240
orchid's growing medium.

274
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,440
When sprayed on the leaves, this mixture

275
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,520
helps remove dirt and small insects,

276
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,360
protects the leaves from diseases, and

277
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,360
helps the plant photosynthesize more

278
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,360
effectively.

279
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,760
When sprayed on the stem, it helps

280
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,760
prevent the growth of bacteria and

281
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,760
fungi, keeping the stem healthy and

282
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,760
preventing it from rotting or getting

283
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,760
damaged.

284
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,320
When sprayed on the roots and growing

285
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,000
medium, it helps balance the pH in the

286
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,840
medium, promoting better root

287
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,840
development and more effective nutrient

288
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,840
absorption.

289
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,640
Step three, use a soft cloth to absorb

290
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,559
the excess water on the leaves and

291
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,640
between the leaf veins, helping the

292
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:47,799
leaves dry quickly and preventing mold

293
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,799
from developing.

294
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:56,000
Uh, please comment and let me know which

295
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,679
country you're watching the video from.

296
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,039
It's wonderful that we can chat with

297
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,039
each other from all around the world.

298
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,559
After that, place the orchid pot in a

299
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:17,280
spot with gentle sunlight and good

300
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,120
airflow. Do not water it for 3 days to

301
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:24,000
allow the plant time to absorb the

302
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:25,679
nutrients and recover naturally.

303
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,840
Next, we will prepare another very

304
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,120
special natural fertilizer for orchids.

305
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,640
You only need a few familiar

306
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:36,200
ingredients. Ripe banana, garlic, honey,

307
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,200
and warm water.

308
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,840
Take one ripe banana and slice it into

309
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,840
thin pieces. Bananas provide plenty of

310
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,320
potassium and natural nutrients that

311
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:49,320
help stimulate strong flowering in the

312
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,320
plant.

313
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,679
Um, then put the sliced banana into a

314
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,279
clean jar. A glass or plastic jar will

315
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,679
work as long as it has a tight fitting

316
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,679
lid for fermentation.

[Music]

318
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,799
Next, take three cloves of garlic and

319
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,799
chop them finely. Garlic helps with

320
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:39,000
antibacterial and antifungal properties

321
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,000
and boosts the orchid's resistance.

have you along on this journey.

328
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:20,039
After slicing, add the garlic to the jar

329
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,039
along with the banana.

[Music]

332
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,679
The next ingredient is one teaspoon of

333
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,679
dry yeast. The dry yeast will help

334
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,279
ferment the mixture, creating enzymes

335
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,279
that are beneficial for the orchid's

336
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,279
growth.

337
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,919
Uh the next ingredient is honey. Add

338
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,760
about 1 teaspoon of honey, which will

339
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:09,799
enrich the mixture with nutrients and

340
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,799
support the fermentation process.

[Music]

342
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,960
Finally, add 0.5 L of warm water. The

343
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,480
warm water helps dissolve the

344
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,760
ingredients and stimulates the

345
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,760
fermentation process quickly.

[Music]

347
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,480
We should not fill the jar completely

348
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,320
with water leaving some space at the top

349
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,360
uh because fermentation will produce

350
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:48,080
gas. This space allows the mixture to

351
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:52,120
avoid overflowing as gas is created

352
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,120
during the fermentation process.

353
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,480
Then close the lid and place the jar in

354
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,159
a cool, airy spot for 3 weeks. After

355
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,880
this time, the mixture will ferment and

356
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:08,440
produce GE, growth enhancer, ready to be

357
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,440
used for the orchids.

this mixture and wrap it around the

376

unopened buds to help stimulate the

377
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,520
growth of new flower stems. The GE will

378
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:21,799
provide nutrients to help these buds

383
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,360
Step four, use a soft cloth to soak up

384
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,440
this mixture and wrap it around the

385
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,399
unopened buds to help stimulate the

386
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,000
growth of new flower stems. The GE will

387
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:34,279
provide nutrients to help these buds

388
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,279
develop and bloom in the future.

389
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:41,279
Just water each pot with about 10

390
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:43,679
tablespoons of the GE mixture. Uh this

391
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:46,000
amount is enough to provide nutrients to

392
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:49,640
the plant without overwatering and

393
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,640
causing root rot.

00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,480
[Music]

395
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,399
Uh in addition to the English voiceover,

396
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,640
we have now created voiceovers in

397
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,559
French, German, Italian, Spanish,

398
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,039
Portuguese, Japanese, Hindi, and

399
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:07,159
Indonesian to help you listen to and

400
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,159
understand the content more easily.

401
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,720
For languages without voiceovers, we

402
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,760
have created subtitles so you can read

403
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,760
and understand the content.

404
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,080
Then pour this mixture into a spray

405
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,080
bottle.

406
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,240
Step six, spray this mixture over the

407
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,399
entire orchid pot, including the leaves,

408
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,000
stem, roots, and growing medium.

409
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:51,919
Spraying helps evenly distribute

410
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,559
nutrients, stimulating the plant to grow

411
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,559
and bloom continuously.

412
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,840
When you spray it on the leaves and

413
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:07,360
roots, it helps the orchid easily absorb

414
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,880
essential nutrients from the GE mixture,

415
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,399
supporting healthy growth and

416
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:14,320
strengthening the root system.

417
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:16,240
Spraying on the stem and unopened nodes

418
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,799
helps stimulate the orchid to bloom

419
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:22,919
regularly, contributing to beautiful and

420
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,919
longlasting flowering periods.

421
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,440
The GE mixture helps repel harmful

422
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,200
insects and supports disease prevention,

423
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:33,120
making the orchid plant healthier.

424
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,279
Wait 20 minutes before removing the

425
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,720
cloth wrapped around the nodes. This

426
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,240
amount of time is enough for the

427
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,840
nutrients to be absorbed and to

428
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:43,159
stimulate the nodes to develop new

429
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,159
flower spikes.

430
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,000
Wait 20 minutes before removing the

431
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,360
cloth wrapped around the nodes. This

432
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,880
amount of time is enough for the

433
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,480
nutrients to be absorbed and to

434
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,799
stimulate the nodes to develop new

435
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,799
flower spikes.

436
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:01,170
[Music]

437
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,360
After 20 minutes, remove the cloth

438
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,840
wrapped around the nodes and repeat once

439
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:11,640
a week. This helps stimulate the growth

440
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,640
of new flower stems.

[Music]

442
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,399
After soaking the orchid pot for about

443
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,480
20 minutes, remember to take it out.

444
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:28,159
This helps the plant absorb nutrients

445
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,159
effectively without causing water

446
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,159
logging.

447
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,279
Step seven, use a cloth to absorb the

448
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,760
excess water on the leaves and leaf

449
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,760
axles. This helps prevent water from

450
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,279
accumulating, avoiding leaf rot and

451
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,279
keeping the leaves dry and well

452
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,279
ventilated.

[Music]

455
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:08,079
Um, after wiping the leaves, place the

456
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:10,079
orchid pot in a spot with gentle

457
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,760
sunlight. This helps the plant recover

458
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:15,800
and grow naturally without being

459
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,800
affected by harsh sunlight.

460
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,040
Use any remaining mixture to spray on

461
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,440
orchids that are currently blooming.

462
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:29,480
This helps the flowers last longer and

463
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,480
maintains the plant's health.

464
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:35,679
Um, the GE mixture helps boost the

465
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,040
orchid's resistance, allowing the plant

466
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,800
to defend against environmental

467
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,800
stressors like intense sunlight and

468
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,800
drought.

469
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,159
The nutrients in this mixture promote

470
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,079
root development, helping the orchid

471
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,989
absorb water and nutrients more

472
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:53,440
effectively.

473
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:55,760
[Applause]

474
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,599
The GE mixture provides nutrients that

475
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,440
help the orchids leaves grow strong,

476
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,680
shiny, and fresh, giving the plant a

477
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,680
healthy appearance.

478
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,200
The nutrients in GE not only help the

479
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,800
current flowers last longer, but also

480
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,040
stimulate the buds that haven't bloomed

481
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:14,040
yet, encouraging the orchid to flower

482
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,040
continuously.

483
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,000
Using GE fertilizer to care for orchids

484
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,480
is very beneficial, but it should be

485
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,839
done about twice a month. This allows

486
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,440
the plant to absorb nutrients

487
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:26,190
effectively without causing

488
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:30,640
overfertilization.

00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,960
Now, let me show you the results after

491
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,090
after 1 month of care with natural

492
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,760

494
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,119
You can see that the orchid has grown

495
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,960
many new roots, which proves that the

496
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,800
natural fertilizer has helped the plant

497
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,710
grow healthily and absorb nutrients

498
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:59,119
better.

500
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,680
The leaves have become greener, shinier,

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,240
and stronger compared to before using

502
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,240
the natural fertilizer.

503
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:16,000
The orchid has grown a new leaf which

504
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,400
proves that the care method and natural

505
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,720
fertilizer are working very well for the

506
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,720

And you can also see the flowers lasting

510
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,160
much longer, which proves that the

511
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:48,070
natural fertilizer helps the flowers

512
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:58,880
