Hi everybody

2
00:00:30,305 --> 00:00:36,893
If you have an orchid with wilted leaves like this.

3
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:46,991
Cut off all wilted leaves and damaged roots.

4
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:56,877
The top can still continue to grow more leaves

5
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:12,874
Leave for 1 day without watering so that the cut heals quickly.

6
00:02:17,195 --> 00:02:23,872
Now we make fertilizer to promote the growth of orchids

7
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:32,870
Take 1 spoon of sugar

8
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:42,868
Then add 2 tablespoons of white wine

9
00:03:00,227 --> 00:03:06,897
Mix with 2 liters of water

10
00:03:25,074 --> 00:03:33,891
Then you clean the leaves with this water to help eliminate fungal diseases and insects.

11
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:10,951
Then you use this water to water the orchid roots.

12
00:04:12,688 --> 00:04:18,099
Do it every 2 weeks

13
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:25,256
Soaking in this water for 10 minutes helps stimulate rooting very well

14
00:04:27,628 --> 00:04:33,879
Recycle plastic bottles into orchid root nursery tools.

15
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:36,234
Add sterilized dry moss here.

16
00:05:49,206 --> 00:05:56,196
Then water regularly and keep moist to stimulate root growth.

17
00:06:00,034 --> 00:06:07,320
Watering the orchid with water mixed with sugar and white wine once every 2 weeks will stimulate rapid root growth

18
00:06:09,877 --> 00:06:16,892
and spraying moisturizing mist with water helps leaves stay fresh and recover quickly.

19
00:06:26,435 --> 00:06:32,889
Place in a cool place with enough light for photosynthesis.

20
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:41,887
1 Month Later

21
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:50,886
The orchid leaf has gotten stronger and has grown a new leaf at the top.

22
00:07:03,751 --> 00:07:10,882
WOW!!! This method stimulates the root system to develop very well.

23
00:07:41,717 --> 00:07:46,874
 
We cut it into 2 orchid pots

24
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:06,870
Apply toothpaste to the cut to help it heal quickly 

25
00:08:45,255 --> 00:08:53,894
Then plant the upper stem of the orchid in a new pot to help the plant grow faster

26
00:09:12,891 --> 00:09:20,889
Previously we applied this method to this orchid species and obtained the following results:

27
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:30,887
The lower stem has been rejuvenated and the baby orchid has been revived.

28
00:09:35,272 --> 00:09:42,885
The orchid's upper stem has grown very healthy and has many flower buds.

29
00:09:43,522 --> 00:09:50,883
