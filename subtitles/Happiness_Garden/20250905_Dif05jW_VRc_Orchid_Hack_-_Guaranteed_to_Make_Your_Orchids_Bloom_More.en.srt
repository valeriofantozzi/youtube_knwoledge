15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:42,280

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,280

[Music]

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,550
First, you need to remove the wilted

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:05,029
flowers and dead stems.

20
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:05,029

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,400
This will help reduce stem rot and

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,640
stimulate new shoots. And the nutrients

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,080
will be concentrated to produce new

24
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:26,769

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,239

33
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,160
Do you have any onions?

34
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,720
Onions contain sulfur compounds and some

35
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,879
antibacterial substances which help

36
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,879
prevent harmful fungi and bacteria for

37
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,879
plants.

38
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,720
I use the peel of an onion to make

39
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,040
fertilizer for orchids because it is

40
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,800
rich in nutrients, helping the roots

41
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,599
grow strong and the leaves become

42
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,599
greener day by day.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,760
Put all the onion peels into a clean jar

44
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,830
ready to be made into nutrient-rich

45
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,239
fertilizer for orchids.

[Music]

47
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,760
The next ingredient we need is flour, a

48
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:08,360
component that will make the fertilizer

49
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,360
more nutritious for orchids as

50
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,640
Take one teaspoon of flour and add it

51
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,640
together with the onion peels.

52
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,159
Then add one liter of water to the

53
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,920
mixture and bring it to a boil, allowing

54
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,840
the nutrients from the onion and flour

55
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,930

Cover the jar, let it sit, and wait for

59
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,400
the water to cool, allowing the

60
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,599
nutrients from the onion and flour to

61
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,599
fully dissolve in the water.

After about 2 hours, when the water has

65
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,400
cooled, we filter out the residue to

66
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,220
leave only the nutrient-rich solution

67
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:28,550
for the orchids.

[Music]

69
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,880
This helps the solution become clearer

70
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,560
and easier to absorb while ensuring the

71
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,680
nutrients are ready to nourish the

72
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,680
orchids for healthy growth.

73
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,639
Then dilute the solution with an

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,479
additional liter of water so the orchids

75
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,270
can easily absorb the nutrients without

76
00:04:52,479 --> 00:05:01,730
it being too strong.

Step one, water each orchid pot with

80
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:15,800
this mixture, ensuring every part of the

81
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,800
plant receives full nutrients.

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,919
Um, the extract from onions or onion

84
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,080
peels not only helps stimulate strong

85
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,840
root growth, but also aids the orchid in

86
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,160
absorbing nutrients better, keeping the

87
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,160
plant healthy and the leaves lush and

88
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,160
green.

89
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,919
Flower provides a valuable source of

90
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,800
nutrients for plants, especially vitamin

91
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:03,880

92
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,949
leaves stay lush and green.

95
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,319
When using flour, it also helps retain

96
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,000
moisture in the soil around the roots,

97
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,080
creating favorable conditions for the

98
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,080
orchid to grow healthily and bloom

99
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,080

Some studies show that flour not only

103
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,120
stimulates strong root growth but also

104
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,199
enhances the overall health of plants,

105
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,520
helping leaves stay lush and flowers

106
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,520

[Music]

108
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,599
After watering, you can leave the orchid

109
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,160
pot soaking in the mixture for about 20

110
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:07,680

111
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,440
the maximum nutrients and grow strong.

[Music]

118
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,280
This is similar to using folure

119
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,960
fertilizer for orchids, helping the

120
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:46,120

122
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,520
Onion peels contain natural compounds

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,240
with antibacterial and antifungal

124
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:10,759

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,759
diseases and keeping the plants healthy.

126
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,160
This type of folure fertilizer provides

127
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,479
all essential nutrients such as

128
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,560
nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium along

129
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:28,919

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,479
This type of folure fertilizer also

132
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,640
helps the orchid flowers become more

133
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:49,480
