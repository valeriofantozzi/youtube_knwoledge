Let orchids grow healthily and bloom with lots of flowers

4
00:00:18,897 --> 00:00:25,895
In this video, I share a new type of organic fertilizer with ingredients available in every kitchen.

5
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:33,894
Helps new roots and flower buds grow abundantly and continuously.

6
00:00:33,894 --> 00:00:38,893
If you are new! Subscribe to the channel so you don't miss any tips on growing and caring for orchids!

7
00:00:38,893 --> 00:00:41,892
Let's start

8
00:00:45,037 --> 00:00:51,890
These are dried bay leaves

9
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:58,889
You can easily buy it at the supermarket

10
00:01:00,888 --> 00:01:05,887
You use 10 bay leaves

11
00:01:07,887 --> 00:01:13,886
Crush or cut into small pieces

12
00:01:25,883 --> 00:01:31,882
Add 500ml boiled water

13
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:46,879
Cover and let it brew until the water cools

14
00:01:54,878 --> 00:01:59,877
Next is rice

15
00:01:59,877 --> 00:02:05,876
Use 3 tablespoons of rice

16
00:02:12,016 --> 00:02:18,873
Add 500ml of room temperature water

17
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:28,871
Cover and wait 1 hour

18
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:39,869
1 hour after the water cools

19
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:55,899
Remember, no amount of fertilizer will help your orchids if they are not receiving enough diffused light, at least 12 hours a day.

20
00:03:25,893 --> 00:03:31,892
Filter residue

21
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:52,888
Mix rice water with bay leaf water

22
00:03:57,887 --> 00:04:03,886
Add 1 liter of water

23
00:04:09,884 --> 00:04:12,884
METHOD 1

24
00:04:13,884 --> 00:04:20,882
You water the orchid roots with this fertilizer.

25
00:04:23,882 --> 00:04:30,880
Fertilizer made from bay leaves and cinnamon rice contains a lot of minerals.

26
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,879
Helps stimulate orchid growth

27
00:04:40,878 --> 00:04:48,877
Fertilizer from bay leaves helps protect plants from harmful fungi and bacteria,

28
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:58,875
thereby enhancing the health of orchids.

29
00:05:00,874 --> 00:05:08,873
Rice water also promotes the growth of beneficial bacteria in the soil, 

30
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:16,871
helps improve aeration and soil structure, 

31
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:21,870
Helps plant roots absorb nutrients.

32
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:36,867
Do this 1-2 times a month to provide nutrition and help protect the orchids

33
00:06:00,896 --> 00:06:08,894
Soaking orchid roots in this water for about 20 minutes will be better

34
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:22,891
Pour this water into the jar

35
00:06:40,888 --> 00:06:43,887
METHOD 2

36
00:06:46,887 --> 00:06:52,885
Spray this fertilizer on the entire orchid 1-2 times/month

37
00:06:56,885 --> 00:07:03,883
Spray thoroughly on both the top and bottom of the leaves

38
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:13,881
This is similar to foliar fertilizing plants

39
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:26,879
Spray both the top and bottom of the leaves

40
00:07:27,801 --> 00:07:36,800
You should do it in the morning so that by noon when the sunlight shines, there is no more water left on the leaves.

41
00:07:37,714 --> 00:07:43,713
Rice water helps keep orchid roots moist without causing water retention. 

42
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:50,467
Bay leaves are rich in minerals, 

43
00:07:50,467 --> 00:07:55,466
especially iron and calcium, 

44
00:07:55,466 --> 00:08:02,465
can help improve the cell structure and health of orchid roots.

45
00:08:04,871 --> 00:08:13,869
When the orchid roots have turned pale silver, it's time to water the orchid.

46
00:08:36,898 --> 00:08:43,897
After watering, the roots turn green

47
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,890
METHOD 3

48
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:26,888
Use a soft cotton pad to absorb this water and gently wipe the leaves

49
00:09:28,888 --> 00:09:35,886
You should wipe the leaves of the plant at least once a month.

50
00:09:37,471 --> 00:09:44,885
Thoroughly wipe the top and bottom of the leaves to remove dirt

51
00:09:47,884 --> 00:09:55,882
Eliminate insects and fungal diseases that harm orchids

52
00:10:00,677 --> 00:10:07,880
The stomata open and the plant will photosynthesize better.

53
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:17,878
This not only cleans the dust but also provides them with nutrients.

54
00:10:18,878 --> 00:10:25,877
This is similar to fertilizing orchids through the leaves.

55
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:33,875
will always grow healthy and green.

56
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:50,872
This is a nest of red spider eggs, I need to clean it up right away before they hatch into spiders

57
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:05,869
Never underestimate natural fertilizers.

58
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:16,900
They are as effective as pre-formed mineral compounds but are safer.

59
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:30,897
Natural fertilizers take time to work, helping plants grow sustainably and survive longer.

60
00:12:01,891 --> 00:12:08,889
After soaking for 20 minutes, take out the orchid pot

61
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:18,887
After fertilizing the plant, I put the orchid in a warm place with enough light to let the water evaporate.

62
00:12:23,886 --> 00:12:26,886
Result

63
00:12:29,885 --> 00:12:36,884
After 2-3 times of fertilizing, the orchid has grown many new roots

64
00:12:42,883 --> 00:12:50,881
This helps orchids absorb the best nutrients through their roots

65
00:14:17,897 --> 00:14:25,896
This type of fertilizer provides nutrients and protects the leaves so the leaves are always green and shiny

66
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:48,891
Orchids should be kept at a temperature of 20-25 degrees during the day and 15-18 degrees at night. 

67
00:14:50,305 --> 00:15:00,889
Such a difference in temperature will promote abundant flowering.

68
00:15:06,888 --> 00:15:12,886
I hope my video is useful to you.

69
00:15:15,886 --> 00:15:23,884
Wishing you in taking care of plants brings you joy and great results.

70
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:30,883
Hope you like this composting recipe!
