Welcome to the happiness garden. Today I

00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,640
will continue to share with you a new

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,519
natural fertilizer method that is simple

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,200
but effective. I hope this recipe will

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,840
give you more options to take care of

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:18,839
your orchid pots so they stay healthy

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,839
and always bloom beautifully at home.

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,320
When you have a small orchid from a

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,160
nursery pot or are about to repot a

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,720
mature orchid, the first step is to

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,359
check the growing medium. If the medium

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,280
is too old, decomposed, or retains

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,360
moisture poorly, you should remove it

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,360
completely. But if the medium is still

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,640
good, we just need to treat it for

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,960
reuse. For this young orchid, the medium

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,480
is still in good condition. So, I will

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,480
treat and keep the old medium.

Um to treat the old growing medium,

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,560
prepare about one liter of clean water

the prepared 1 L of water. Baking soda

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,960
is a natural disinfectant that gently

27
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,240
sterilizes the growing medium while

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,920

29
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,440

41
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,119
about 10 to 20 seconds is enough. For a

42
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,880

80
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,920
When planting orchids, you should choose

81
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,319
a pot with drainage holes at the bottom.

82
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,799
This is very important to prevent water

85
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,760
First, place a few pieces of foam at the

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,320

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,519

the medium settle into the gaps around

102
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,600

111
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,650

126

Put the rice in a pan and toast it over

low heat. Stir evenly until the rice

128

131
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,639
them easier for the plant to absorb.

132
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,720
Toasted rice differs from regular rice

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,280
in that after toasting, the nutrients in

134

136
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,000

You only need to use this mixture twice

190
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,240
a month. Regular use will help your

191
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,480
orchid grow strong with firm roots,

192
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,880
green leaves, and readiness for the next

193
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,880
blooming cycles.

194
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,720
You can also soak the orchid pot in this

195
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,480
mixture for about 20 minutes. This

196
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,480
method allows the roots to absorb

197
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,720
nutrients more deeply while also

198
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,680
soothing the plant after repotting or

199
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,680
during its recovery period.

200
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,959
The leftover solution can be poured into

201
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,510
a spray bottle for easy use on your

202
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:46,720
orchid.

[Music]

204
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,680
Then lightly spray it on the leaves and

205
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,160
roots of other orchids in the garden to

206
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,080
help them absorb nutrients better while

207
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,880
also maintaining moisture and boosting

208
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,880
their natural resistance.

209
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Spraying the toasted rice mixture will

210
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,240
provide a gentle amount of nutrients to

211
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,800
the orchid. As a result, the leaves

212
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,040
become greener, the roots grow stronger,

213
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,600
and the plant recovers more easily after

214
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,600
periods of stress.

215
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,279
In addition, the thin mist from the

216
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,959
solution helps retain moisture on the

217
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,200
surface of the leaves. This is

218
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,200
especially useful during dry weather or

219
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,950

220
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,129

patience and a little love, your orchid

240
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,100

a positive sign that the plant is

247
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,370

strong root growth and enhances nutrient

absorption. When the root system is

262
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,279
healthy, the orchid will quickly

263
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:54,079
stabilize in the new growing medium and

264
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,760

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,440
vital foundation for the plant to

266
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,920

Next, you can use expired milk or

380
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,559
leftover milk from the fridge. A great

381

383
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:31,200
Just about 1 tsp of milk, equivalent to

384

385

This spraying method also helps clean

dust and remove insects on the leaves,

452
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,760
