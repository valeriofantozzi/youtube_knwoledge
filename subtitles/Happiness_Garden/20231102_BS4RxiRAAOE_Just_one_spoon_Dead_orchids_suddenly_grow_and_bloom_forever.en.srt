00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:17,897
Today I picked up a rotten orchid that someone threw away.

3
00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:36,893
The roots have mostly rotted, so all damaged roots need to be removed.

4
00:00:43,325 --> 00:00:52,890
Only one root remains that has not rotted.

5
00:00:54,423 --> 00:01:00,888
Then rinse with water.

6
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:32,882
Turmeric starch 1 spoon.

7
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:46,879
Add 2 liters of water.

8
00:02:29,991 --> 00:02:38,869
Vitamin B1 one tablet.

9
00:02:51,968 --> 00:02:57,965
Soak for 10 minutes

10
00:03:04,406 --> 00:03:16,895
Soak the moss for 30 minutes.

11
00:03:31,892 --> 00:03:55,887
Soak pine bark for 30 minutes.

12
00:04:10,195 --> 00:04:14,883
10 MINUTES LATER.

13
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:32,880
Dry the cut.

14
00:04:36,848 --> 00:04:44,877
Apply toothpaste to the cut.

15
00:04:46,877 --> 00:04:53,876
Wait for the toothpaste to dry.

16
00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:06,873
Recycle plastic boxes into orchid nursery tools.

17
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:23,870
Styrofoam.

18
00:05:36,258 --> 00:05:40,900
30 MINUTES LATER.

19
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:25,891
Place the orchid branch in the nursery pot.

20
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,890
Pour water into the orchid pot.

21
00:06:32,423 --> 00:06:38,888
The water level only reached the base of the pine bark.

22
00:06:38,888 --> 00:06:46,887
Then spray vitamin B1 water once every 7 days (Recipe at the end of the video).

23
00:06:54,963 --> 00:07:02,883
Place in a cool, well-lit place.

24
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:12,881
3 WEEKS LATER.

25
00:07:19,714 --> 00:07:29,878
The dry orchid branch has sprouted and taken root.

26
00:07:43,384 --> 00:07:54,873
Take 1 vitamin B1 tablet and mix it with 300ml of water.

27
00:08:26,763 --> 00:08:36,898
Then spray vitamin B1 on the orchid every 7 days.

28
00:08:47,346 --> 00:08:50,895
2 MONTHS LATER.

29
00:08:56,661 --> 00:09:06,892
The orchid branch has grown strong and strong.

30
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:18,890
Roots grow very healthily.

31
00:09:44,248 --> 00:09:54,883
From now on, I add fertilizer to the small orchids to help them grow quickly.

32
00:09:58,048 --> 00:10:08,880
and does not require shielding like a greenhouse, allowing orchids to grow in the outside environment.

33
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:26,876
Thank you for watching the video. Good luck and see you in the next videos..
