00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,200
Welcome to my happiness

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
garden. Today I'm going to continue

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,080
sharing with you a special way to make

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,719
natural fertilizer that helps care for

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,719
orchids at

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,439

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,840
you'll see your orchids thrive and bloom

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,840
all year round.

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,359
Let's get

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,920
started. To make this fertilizer, I need

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,920
coffee or you can also use coffee

00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,890
[Music]

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,680
grounds. Take one teaspoon of coffee

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,920
powder into the pot and add one liter of

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,920
hot water.

33
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,519
water to gently wipe the top and bottom

34
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,519
of the leaves

35
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,239
thoroughly. Wiping the leaves helps

36
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,760
remove dust and impurities, allowing the

37
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,760
plant to photosynthesize more

38
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,760
effectively.

39
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,720
Coffee can also help increase humidity

40
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,440
for the leaves which is beneficial for

41
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,440
the development of orchids.

42
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,040
Coffee contains many nutrients such as

43
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,040
nitrogen which helps promote plant

44
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,040
growth.

[Music]

46
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,320
The compounds in coffee can enhance the

plant's ability to resist

48
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:36,919
diseases. Coffee can provide a pleasant

49
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,919
aroma to the surrounding space.

50
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:51,759
These combined benefits help your

51
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,759
orchids stay healthy and thrive

52
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:03,639
better. Do this step one to two times a

53
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,639
month.

54
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,280
Step

55
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,460
two, put the ground coffee solution into

56
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,500
a spray bottle.

[Music]

58
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:47,240
Oh, and then you spray your entire

59
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,240
orchid.

60
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,919
The coffee solution contains nitrogen

61
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,919
and other minerals promoting plant

62
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,440
growth. Nitrogen is crucial for protein

63
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,080
synthesis and chlorophyll production

64
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,080
necessary for photosynthesis.

65
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,199
Compounds in coffee can help orchids

66
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,720
resist certain diseases and pests,

67
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,120
potentially reducing the need for

68
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,120
chemical pesticides.

69
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,720
Uh spraying coffee solution increases

70
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,120
humidity for the leaves and the

71
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,120
surrounding

72
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:04,319
environment. After spraying, wiping off

73
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,880
the excess water on orchid leaves is

74
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,960
crucial for several reasons.

75
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,560
Um, water accumulation on leaves can

76
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,440
create a favorable environment for the

77
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,440
growth of fungi and

78
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,319
bacteria. If water is not dried off, the

79
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,440
plant is more susceptible to diseases

80
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,440
like leaf rot or mold.

81
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,720
When water sits on the leaves, sunlight

82
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,199
may be reflected, reducing the plant's

83
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,199
ability to

84
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:56,360
photosynthesize. Wiping the leaves dry

85
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,360
optimizes the photosynthesis process.

86
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,280
Step

87
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:29,360
three. When orchid roots appear silvery

88
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,000
white and the growing medium is dry,

89
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:36,399
this usually indicates that the plant is

90
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,399
lacking water and needs to be watered

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,040
this natural fertilizer, the orchid

132
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,040

133
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,040

134
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,000
New roots develop and the root system

remains healthy and

136
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,320
