00:00:20,777 --> 00:00:24,896
Welcome to my channel

2
00:00:26,913 --> 00:00:32,894
If you have an orchid with yellow leaves like this,

3
00:00:32,894 --> 00:00:40,892
Don't rush to throw it away.

4
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:58,189
What to do is: Remove all damaged leaves and roots.

5
00:01:05,887 --> 00:01:15,885
This orchid only has 1 leaf that is still fresh and can recover.

6
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:27,883
The original part is completely damaged so it should be thrown away.

7
00:01:46,513 --> 00:01:56,511
Rinsing with water helps remove mold and dirt

8
00:02:10,867 --> 00:02:16,840
Take 1 clove of garlic.

9
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:33,403
cut into thin slices.

10
00:02:53,953 --> 00:03:00,931
Add 1 liter of warm water.

11
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:08,863
Use honey

12
00:03:15,603 --> 00:03:21,594
Take 1 spoon of honey.

13
00:03:31,352 --> 00:03:40,324
Honey and garlic have antiseptic properties that help eliminate fungal orchid diseases

14
00:03:47,496 --> 00:03:56,487
Leave for 30 minutes for the nutrients to completely dissolve in the water before restoring the orchid

15
00:04:02,298 --> 00:04:06,885
30 minutes later

16
00:04:25,277 --> 00:04:34,246
Use cotton to clean the top and bottom of the leaves

17
00:04:36,246 --> 00:04:46,244
Helps remove mold, dirt and larvae that damage orchids

18
00:05:03,357 --> 00:05:11,339
Then soak the orchid leaves in this water for 30 minutes

19
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:21,304
Helps kill fungal diseases and stimulate rooting

20
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:33,868
I recycle plastic bottles into orchid nursery equipment

21
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:10,127
Please use makeup remover cotton and do like me

22
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:29,923
Cotton helps retain moisture so this orchid roots quickly

23
00:06:46,467 --> 00:06:56,451
You pour water into the jar like I did

24
00:07:00,692 --> 00:07:05,683
Just let the water level reach this position

25
00:07:05,683 --> 00:07:12,848
The water will be absorbed and the orchid will quickly take root

26
00:07:13,448 --> 00:07:23,446
Then every 3 days spray the orchid with water to keep it moist

27
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:34,177
When the water is dirty, change the water to keep the orchid from rotting

28
00:07:34,177 --> 00:07:42,409
and place it in a cool place with lots of light, the orchid leaves will revive quickly

29
00:07:49,787 --> 00:07:54,773
3 Weeks Later

30
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:06,204
Even though the leaves are still withered, the orchid roots still grow very healthily,

31
00:08:06,204 --> 00:08:12,743
and orchids grow new leaves.

32
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:26,367
As the roots grow, they will absorb water and nutrients and the leaves will become fresh again very quickly.

33
00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:50,629
Now I plant it in a new pot so the orchid can grow in an outside environment

34
00:08:55,074 --> 00:09:05,059
With this simple method, you can completely revive weak orchids at home easily

35
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:18,123

40
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:22,877
In this video, I continue to share new methods.

Subscribe to videos so you don't miss any Tips on my channel.

42
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:46,872
To perform this type of analysis, you need soybeans.

43
00:10:48,872 --> 00:10:55,871
Take 60 grams of soybeans.

44
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:25,898
Then soak in 600ml of boiled water.

45
00:11:32,897 --> 00:11:40,895
Wait until the water cools.

46
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:10,889
Once cooled, grind the soybeans with a blender.

47
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:36,884
Pour into jar.

48
00:12:50,881 --> 00:12:59,879
Next add 30 grams of sugar.

49
00:13:17,876 --> 00:13:25,874
Then add 30 grams of composting microorganisms.

50
00:13:50,869 --> 00:13:57,868
Cover this hole with cotton wool.

51
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:10,899
This prevents insects from entering the jar and air can still circulate in and out of the jar.

52
00:14:33,894 --> 00:14:40,893
Store in a cool place, away from direct sunlight for 3 weeks.

53
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:57,889
This is the product I made after 3 weeks.

54
00:15:06,888 --> 00:15:12,886
Take 10ml of fermented soybean fertilizer.

55
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:26,884
and dilute with 3 liters of water.

56
00:15:33,882 --> 00:15:36,882
FIRST METHOD

57
00:15:39,881 --> 00:15:46,880
Water this fertilizer solution on the orchid roots.

58
00:15:58,877 --> 00:16:06,876
Soybean fertilizers are often rich in nitrogen, potassium and other nutrients,

59
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:22,872
Helps provide necessary nutrients for orchids.

60
00:16:29,871 --> 00:16:36,870
Nitrogen helps plants grow green leaves, potassium promotes flowering

61
00:16:39,869 --> 00:16:46,868
and keeps flowers on branches for a long time.

62
00:16:55,899 --> 00:17:03,898
Fermented soybean fertilizer provides adequate nutrients for plants to help strengthen the immune system,

63
00:17:05,897 --> 00:17:13,896
Helps plants become more resistant to diseases and pests.

64
00:17:18,895 --> 00:17:26,893
Do this 1-2 times/month to supplement nutrition and increase the orchid's resistance.

65
00:17:31,892 --> 00:17:35,891
SECOND METHOD.

66
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:46,889
Spray this fertilizer on the entire orchid.

67
00:17:52,888 --> 00:18:00,886
This method is similar to using foliar fertilizer.

68
00:18:16,883 --> 00:18:23,882
Spraying aerial roots helps aerial roots develop.

69
00:18:25,881 --> 00:18:29,881
THIRD METHOD.

70
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:41,878
Clean the leaf surface with this liquid fertilizer.

71
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:53,876
The leaf surface will always be clean and airy with stomata.

72
00:18:56,875 --> 00:19:02,874
Orchids will photosynthesize better.

73
00:19:04,874 --> 00:19:12,872
Fertilizing regularly 1-2 times/month will help keep the leaves healthy.

74
00:19:14,872 --> 00:19:18,871
RESULT

75
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:28,869
After 3 times of applying this fertilization method, the root system has developed very strongly.

76
00:19:37,867 --> 00:19:45,899
Soybean fertilizer helps orchids grow strongly and bloom more.

77
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:57,897
Nutrients like phosphorus and potassium in this fertilizer
Promotes plants to bloom

78
00:20:00,896 --> 00:20:06,895
