Welcome to my little orchid garden where

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,480
each petal is nurtured with love and

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,400
passion.

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,480
Today I will guide you on how to

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,480
propagate orchids at home using the stem

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,320
cutting method. Simple yet effective.

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,720
The ideal time for stem cutting is when

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,720
the orchid flowers begin to fade. When

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,680
the plant enters its resting phase and

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,640
is ready for new growth.

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,240
This flower stem is the ideal time to

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,320
take a cutting, helping the plant grow

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:57,580

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,240
Keep the unopened buds like this for

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,159
stem cutting as they contain dormant

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,159
shoots that can sprout into new orchid

19
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,159

21
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,560
As for the positions where the flowers

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,600
have bloomed, you should cut them off as

23
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:32,119
they no longer contain uh dormant buds

24
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,119
to develop into new orchid plants.

[Music]

26
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,960
I keep these two dormant buds for stem

27
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,680
cutting and later the new orchid plant

28
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,680
will grow from here.

[Music]

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,239
I cut across here to avoid crushing the

31
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,239
cut as crushed areas are prone to

32
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,239
infection and can affect the plant's

33
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,239
growth.

34
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,879
At the base of the cutting, I make a

35
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,360
diagonal cut to create a larger contact

36
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:53,060
surface, which helps the cutting absorb

37
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:56,580
water and nutrients more effectively.

39
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,519
Then I sprinkle turmeric powder on the

40
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,920
cut. This helps with antibacterial

41
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,520
protection, uh, prevents rot and

42
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:47,760
promotes faster healing of the wound.

After that, I leave the cutting for a

45
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,159
few hours without watering to let the

46
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,590

51
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,680
