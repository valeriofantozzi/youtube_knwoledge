Hello friends

2
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:10,598
When the orchid has all its leaves rotten like this

3
00:00:10,598 --> 00:00:16,564
Don't rush to throw it away

4
00:00:16,564 --> 00:00:24,429
I will show you how to revive it in a simple way

5
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:32,294
Just by applying this recipe correctly,

6
00:00:32,294 --> 00:00:40,259
anyone can easily revive rotten orchids at home.

7
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:42,159
oh

8
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:50,157
This orchid has rotten leaves but the roots are still very strong

9
00:00:58,385 --> 00:01:06,369
First, cut off all the damaged roots

10
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:39,847
Then rinse with water

11
00:01:44,832 --> 00:01:54,259
Use 1 clove of garlic

12
00:01:56,339 --> 00:02:02,385
and add 1 sprig of fresh ginger

13
00:02:05,017 --> 00:02:44,162
Then slice and mince both garlic and ginger

14
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:59,188
Filter out the residue

15
00:03:04,277 --> 00:03:11,447
Soak orchid branches in ginger and garlic juice for 20 minutes

16
00:03:17,301 --> 00:03:19,301
20 MINUTES AFTER

17
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:41,348
Take it out and hang it in a cool place for 2 hours

18
00:03:53,835 --> 00:03:55,835
2 HOURS AFTER

19
00:03:57,732 --> 00:04:06,425
Orchid branch has dried

20
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:16,633
then sprinkle cinnamon powder on the cut

21
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:26,635
This helps the cut heal quickly and the roots do not rot

22
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:41,045
Then plant orchids with pine bark or dry soil

23
00:04:41,045 --> 00:04:50,644
Then leave in a cool place for a week without watering

24
00:04:57,379 --> 00:05:01,587
AFTER 1 WEEK WITHOUT WATERING

25
00:05:02,006 --> 00:05:08,574
Cover the pot with a layer of moss to keep it moist

26
00:05:12,082 --> 00:05:22,137
and from now on start watering and moisturizing once a week

27
00:05:28,444 --> 00:05:38,467
Next you take a plate and pour water in like I did

28
00:05:40,826 --> 00:05:46,835
put the orchid pot in the dish of water

29
00:05:47,963 --> 00:05:56,083
 
Cover the orchid with a clear plastic bottle like this

30
00:05:56,083 --> 00:06:01,380
and the orchid will grow like a greenhouse

31
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:08,166
1 MONTH LATER

32
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:19,347
Orchid root has germinated very healthy

33
00:06:22,427 --> 00:06:29,316
New roots have also grown

34
00:06:45,851 --> 00:06:53,398
Continue misting to keep moisture waiting for orchids to grow

35
00:06:58,463 --> 00:07:02,719
EXTRA 1 MONTH

36
00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:10,641
The orchid branch has revived strongly

37
00:07:13,394 --> 00:07:23,197
New roots grow very well

38
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:35,144
So with this simple way

39
00:07:35,144 --> 00:07:42,875
Anyone can revive rotten orchids at home
