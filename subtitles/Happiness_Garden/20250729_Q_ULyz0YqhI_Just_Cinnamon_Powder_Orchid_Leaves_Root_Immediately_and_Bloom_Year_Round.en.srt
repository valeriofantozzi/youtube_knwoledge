Let's get started.

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,439
This is an orchid that has rotted. It

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,760
was discarded, but I brought it home to

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,760
revive it.

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,239
After the orchid blooms, the plant often

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,719
becomes a bit weak because it has used a

15
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,879
lot of energy to flower.

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,200
Um, if not properly cared for, the

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,960
orchid may struggle to recover and it

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,980
will be difficult for it to bloom again

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,520
next time.

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,490
You need to remove all the damaged

27
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,960
Uh the plant doesn't have to nourish the

28
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,360
weak parts, allowing it to focus on the

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,360
healthy sections.

30
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,880
Removing the old parts helps the plant

47
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,840
For the orchid stem, we need to make a

48
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,519
clean cut to avoid crushing it, which

49
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,000
will reduce the risk of rot from the

50
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,000
cut.

51
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,440
These rotting leaves should be removed

52
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,640
and kept far from the garden to prevent

53
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,640
spreading the rot to other orchids.

Take one spoonful of cinnamon powder and

57
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,599
put it into a jar.

58
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,220

Now, strain out the residue.

Cinnamon has natural antibacterial and

rot, especially root and stem rot.

Step one, use a soft cotton ball to soak

80
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,080
bottom of the leaves.

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,520
Wiping the leaves clean helps remove

fungi, bacteria, or mold that may

83
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,560
develop on the surface, reducing the

risk of the plant getting infected.

85
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,880
When the leaves are cleaned, light can

86
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,120
easily reach the surface, helping the

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,080
Then place it here

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:53,240
helps stimulate the growth of new roots,

Next, take one aloe vera leaf.

Aloe vera contains oxin, a natural plant

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,480
Many new roots are growing under the

195
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,960
layer of moss.

198
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,880
These new roots help the plant grow

199
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,880
strong, recover quickly, and prepare to

200
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,880
bloom.

203
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,040
Now I'm planting the orchid leaf in a

204
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,040
new pot so it can grow better in the

205
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,040
outside.

207
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,199
Um I'm planting it with pine bark chips

208
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,880
uh which maintain uh moderate moisture

209
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:34,040
and provide good drainage for the roots

210
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,040
to grow.

212
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,279
with this simple method. You can quickly

213
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,680
and effectively revive a weakened orchid

214
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,680
on your own.

215
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,519
I hope you enjoyed the video. Don't

216
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,680
forget to support the channel and leave

217
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,680
a comment.

218
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,959
Now you just need to care for it like

219
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,720
any other regular orchid plant.

220
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,640
Uh take care of your orchids with all

221
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,600
the love for plants and you'll get to

222
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,039
