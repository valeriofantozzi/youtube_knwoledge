Uh yeast brewed from fresh ginger has

198
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,120
the effect of stimulating sprouting,

199
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,279
strong rooting, repelling insects,

200
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,560
killing fungi, stimulating buds, and

201
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:44,959
stimulating growth.

202
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,200
GE ginger also helps orchids increase

203
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:50,560
their ability to absorb nutrients from

204
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:54,560
the fertilizer you fertilize them.

205
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:56,480
Only do this one to two times a month.

206
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,690
Do not use too much as it will affect

207
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,639
the growth of orchids.

After one week of use, new roots grow

211
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,190
very quickly.

213
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:21,480
These roots will help the orchid absorb

214
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,480
nutrients more easily and more.

215
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,070
Orchids grow well or not thanks to the

216
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:32,079
photosynthesis of roots and leaves.

orchid fertilizing method is? Please

When the orchid is healthy, after the

230
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,480
orchid branch blooms, the last flowers,

231
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:14,680
then there will be new flowers that

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,680
flowers that will continue to grow.
