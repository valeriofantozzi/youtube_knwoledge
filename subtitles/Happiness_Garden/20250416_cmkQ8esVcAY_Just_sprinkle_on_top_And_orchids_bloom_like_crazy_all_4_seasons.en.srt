00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,760
Hello everyone. Today I'm going to share

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,680
with you a simple way to make natural

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,240
fertilizer at home, which will help your

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,200
orchids grow healthy, lush, and bloom

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,200
beautifully throughout the

6
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,279
garden. Thanks to this natural

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,279
fertilizer, the roots and leaves of the

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,279
plant will stay healthy, which in turn

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,519
helps the orchid produce not only more

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,519
flowers, but also longerlasting blooms

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,359
that retain their color and stay on the

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,439
stem for a long time before fading.

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,280
The method is very simple. Anyone can do

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,000
it using familiar ingredients found

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,480
right in the

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,480
kitchen. Let's get

17
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,719
started. As you can see, this is an old

18
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,559
orchid with many leaves at the base

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,879
starting to turn yellow and gradually

20
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,640
fall off. This is a sign that the plant

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,640
is weak and needs proper care to

22
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,239
recover. To help the plant recover, we

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,399
need to cut off the yellow leaves,

24
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,520
withered leaves, and especially any

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,520
leaves showing signs of

26
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,840
[Music]

27
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,600
disease. After removing the yellow and

28
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,600
withered leaves, we continue by cutting

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,600
off any damaged, rotting, or injured

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,600
roots.

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,880
This will prevent the plant from

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,560
spreading any diseases and allow it to

33
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,280
focus its nutrients on the remaining

34
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,280
healthy roots and

35
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,600
leaves. To identify damaged roots,

36
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,759
gently squeeze them. If the roots feel

37
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,520
soft, mushy, or have a foul odor, it

38
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,840
means they are rotting and should be cut

39
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,840
off

40
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,159
immediately. This helps stop the spread

41
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,360
of disease and protects the remaining

42
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,360
healthy roots.

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,920
Uh, please comment and let me know which

44
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,439
country you're watching the video from.

45
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,320
It's amazing that we can chat with each

46
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,680
other from all over the

47
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,439
world. If you haven't subscribe to the

don't miss any orchid growing tips. It's

51
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,879
wonderful to have you as a companion on

52
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,560
this journey.

53
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,720
After trimming all the damaged leaves

54
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,879
and roots, we place the orchid in a

55
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,120
cool, wellventilated area and let it

56
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,879
rest overnight. This gives the plant

57
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,070
time to recover before we start

58
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,210
fertilizing and continuing

59
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,210
[Music]

60
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:37,720
care. Today to make natural fertilizer

61
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,720
for the orchid, I will be using coffee.

62
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,879
Take three tablespoons of pure coffee

63
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,160
and add it to a

64
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:46,800
bottle. Coffee is not only a great

65
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,959
source of nutrition for the plant, but

66
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,280
it also helps increase the acidity of

67
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,000
the soil, allowing the plant to absorb

68
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,000
nutrients more

69
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,720
effectively. Pour one liter of boiling

70
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,720
water to dilute the coffee.

71
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,120
Then let it sit overnight to cool

72
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,840
naturally, allowing the coffee to fully

73
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,840
dissolve in the water.

74
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,319
The next ingredient is wheat

75
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,680
flour. Uh wheat flour provides

76
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,959
additional nutrients for the plant,

77
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,280
especially important minerals like

78
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,000
phosphorus and magnesium which help the

79
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,000
orchid grow

80
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,560
healthier. Take one teaspoon of wheat

81
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:01,239
flour, then add it to one liter of water

82
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,239
at room temperature to dilute it.

83
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,120
Then let this solution sit overnight at

84
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,960
room temperature. This allows the

85
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,120
components in the wheat flour to fully

86
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,320
blend together, creating a highly

87
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,320
effective fertilizer for the orchid.

88
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,040
After letting it sit overnight, strain

89
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,040
out the coffee grounds before using the

90
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,680
solution. Stir the strained coffee

91
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,160
solution well to ensure the nutrients

92
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,520
are fully blended into the water, ready

93
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,520
to provide nourishment for the orchid.

94
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,639
In addition to the English voiceover, we

95
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,199
have now created voiceovers in French,

96
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:16,080
German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese,

97
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,759
Japanese, Hindi, and Indonesian to help

98
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,000
you listen to and understand the content

99
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,000
more easily.

100
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,880
[Applause]

101
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,880
Uh for languages without voiceovers, we

102
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,840
have created subtitles so you can read

103
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,840
and understand the content.

104
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,800
Step one, use a soft cloth to soak up

105
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:05,400
the coffee solution and gently wipe both

106
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,400
the top and bottom of the orchid leaves.

107
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,479
As you can see, the leaves of the plant

108
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,759
are very dusty and dirty. This not only

109
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,080
reduces the plant's ability to

110
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,560
photosynthesize, but also hinders the

111
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,039
absorption of nutrients through the leaf

112
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,720
surface.

113
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,800
Therefore, cleaning the leaves is a very

114
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,600
important step before moving on to the

115
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,600
next stages of

116
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,479
care. Wiping orchid leaves with the

117
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,800
coffee solution helps strengthen their

118
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,199
resistance as coffee prevents attacks

119
00:06:52,800 --> 00:07:00,199
from harmful fungi and bacteria that

120
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,199
commonly appear on the leaf surface.

121
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,360
This helps deliver nutrients directly

122
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,039
through the leaf surface. As coffee

123
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,039
contains nitrogen and minerals that

124
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,440
promote lush, healthy foliage from the

125
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,440
inside

126
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,960
out. Wiping orchid leaves with the

127
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,280
coffee solution helps strengthen their

128
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,680
resistance as coffee prevents attacks

129
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:30,599
from harmful fungi and bacteria that

130
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,599
commonly appear on the leaf surface.

131
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,560
When the leaves are healthy, they help

132
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,880
nourish the entire plant, stem, roots,

133
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,759
and flowers, leading to more abundant

134
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,759
blooms that last

135
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,080
longer. Um, to help the orchid grow

136
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,240
healthy, you should wipe the leaves with

137
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,160
the coffee solution once a week during

138
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,080
the first month. After that, you can

139
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,360
reduce the frequency to once a month to

140
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,599
maintain the health of the leaves and

141
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,599
the

142
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:15,599
plant. Step two, pour the coffee

143
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,360
solution into a spray bottle. Using a

144
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,120
spray bottle helps you easily mist the

145
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,280
solution onto other parts of the orchid,

146
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:25,479
such as the stem and roots, allowing the

147
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,479
plant to absorb nutrients optimally.

148
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,440
Then spray the coffee solution onto the

149
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,760
front and back of the leaves, the leaf

150
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,760
axles, the stem, and the roots of the

151
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,760
orchid.

152
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,640
Make sure to spray evenly so that the

153
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,080
solution penetrates all parts of the

154
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:01,040
plant, helping the orchid absorb the

155
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,040
full nutrients from the

156
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,399
coffee. The components in coffee

157
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,320
stimulate root development, providing

158
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,519
the orchid with a solid foundation to

159
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,519
absorb nutrients more effectively.

160
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,040
Regularly providing nutrients through

161
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,279
the coffee solution by spraying helps

162
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,880
the orchid stay healthy, which in turn

163
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,880
promotes longer lasting and fresher

164
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:32,560
blooms. You can spray the coffee

165
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,560
solution on the orchid once a week

166
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,200
during the first month to ensure the

167
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,360
plant absorbs all the nutrients. After

168
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,200
that, reduce the frequency to one to two

169
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,440
times a month to maintain the health of

170
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,440
the plant.

171
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,360
Then you should spread a thin layer of

172
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,360
moss on top of the orchid

173
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,399
pot. Moss not only helps retain moisture

174
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,760
in the soil, but also keeps the orchid

175
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,399
hydrated, especially in dry

176
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,600
environments. At the same time, the moss

177
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,000
layer enhances the appearance of the

178
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,000
orchid pot.

179
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:23,120
[Music]

180
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,959
Next, stir the wheat flour solution

181
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,480
well. Then, mix it with the coffee

182
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,920
solution that you prepared earlier to

183
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,920
create a perfect fertilizer for the

184
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,920
orchid.

185
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,160
When mixing, make sure to strain it

186
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,600
carefully to remove the wheat flour

187
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,600
residue, leaving only the clear liquid.

188
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:55,789
[Music]

189
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,039
[Music]

190
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,320
Step three, water the orchid. pot with

191
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,680
the coffee and wheat flour

192
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,519
mixture. After thoroughly mixing the two

193
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,160
solutions, gently water the soil around

194
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,160
the roots of the

195
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,120
orchid. The coffee and wheat flour

196
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,839
mixture provides essential nutrients

197
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,959
such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and

198
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:49,959
potassium, helping the orchid grow

199
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,959
strong from the leaves to the roots.

200
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,680
Um, wheat flour improves the soil

201
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,920
structure, making it more airy and

202
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:01,680
loose, creating favorable conditions for

203
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,680
the orchid's roots to grow and absorb

204
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:06,880
nutrients. The nutrients in coffee and

205
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,800
wheat flour promote strong root

206
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:13,399
development, providing the orchid with a

207
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,399
solid foundation for sustainable growth.

208
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,839
Uh this mixture helps protect the orchid

209
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,680
from fungal diseases, bacteria, and

210
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,360
harmful insects, keeping the plant

211
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,880
healthy and preventing health

212
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,800
issues. When provided with the necessary

213
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,279
nutrients from wheat flour and coffee,

214
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:35,079
the orchid will grow strong, leading to

215
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:37,839
more even and longerlasting

216
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:41,959
blooms. Then soak the orchid pot in this

217
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,959
mixture for about 20 minutes.

219
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,360
Then remember to remove the orchid pot

220
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,040
and allow the soil to drain completely.

221
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,680
This helps prevent water logging and

222
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,680
keeps the plant

223
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,880
healthy. Step four, use a soft cloth to

224
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,880
absorb any excess water in the leaf

225
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,880
axles.

226
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,839
This helps prevent water from staying on

227
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:19,200
the leaves for too long, avoiding rot or

228
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,200
creating conditions for mold to

229
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,000
develop. Gently wipe off any excess

230
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,000
water to ensure the orchid stays dry and

231
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
healthy.

232
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,519
After absorbing the excess water from

233
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,440
the leaf axles, place the orchid pot in

234
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,639
a spot with gentle sunlight so the plant

235
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,639
