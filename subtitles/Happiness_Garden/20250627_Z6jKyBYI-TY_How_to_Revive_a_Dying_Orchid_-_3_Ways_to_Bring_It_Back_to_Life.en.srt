Welcome to my channel. I share helpful

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,280
Today I will share the simplest way to

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:15,280
help your orchids grow strong roots and

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,520
bloom beautifully at home.

great to have you with me.

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,519
If your orchid has wilted soft leaves

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,200
like this, don't throw it away. This

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,440

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,200
First, we need to check the roots and

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,020
the growing medium to find the cause of

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:55,120
the orchid's wilting.

23
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,119
harmful bacteria and fungi, allowing the

24

Sand is an ideal orchid growing medium

take out the stones and sand to plant

the medium consistently maintains

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,279
weak orchids quickly develop new roots

176

As new roots grow, the orchid can absorb

177
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,079
water and nutrients more effectively,

178
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,079

process.

180
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,560
The growth of new roots also creates a

181
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,440
strong foundation for the orchid to

182
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,600
develop longterm and bloom regularly in

the future.

184
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,560
Rooting weak orchids in sand stimulates

185
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,480
quick new root growth, but we should

186
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,639
avoid keeping them in sand for too long

187
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,360
as it can cause root rot and damage due

188
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,360
to poor air circulation.

[Music]

190
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,680
Therefore, you need to plant the orchid

191
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,760
into a new pot using mediums like pine

192
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,360
bark chips, pummus, or moss to ensure

193
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,360

a quiet emptiness on the branch, marking

577
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,040
the time when the orchid begins to

578
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,720
weaken. During the blooming period, the

579
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,320
plant puts all its strength into

00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,560
nurturing each petal, gradually

We need to cut off the entire old orchid

00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,640
To make natural fertilizer, the first

602
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,720
ingredient I use is eggshells. Eggshells

603
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:33,040
are rich in calcium, which helps orchid

604
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:35,200
roots grow strong and also improves soil

605
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,200
quality, creating favorable conditions

606
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,720
for the plant to absorb nutrients more

607
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:43,989
effectively.

609
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,560
Take two cleaned eggshells, then crush

610
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,750
them by hand and put them into a small

611
00:39:48,560 --> 00:40:09,359

613
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,839
The next ingredient I use is rice

614
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,560
because rice contains vitamins,

615
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:18,400
minerals, and a small amount of starch,

616
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:21,640
all of which are beneficial for orchid

617
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,640
root development.

618
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:27,359
Take 3 tablespoons of rice and add them

619
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:30,670
to the prepared eggshells. Then pour in

620
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:33,780
about.5 L of boiling water.

00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:40,400
release nutrients from the rice and

624
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:43,800
eggshells, creating a nutrient-rich brew

625
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,800
for the orchid.

626
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:48,560
Close the jar and let the solution cool

627
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,079

628
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,190
nutrients fully dissolve, ready to

629
00:40:50,079 --> 00:41:09,520

remember to place the orchid pot in a

764
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,319
spot with gentle sunlight and good

765
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,079
ventilation.

766
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:12,560
Light is an essential factor for

767
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:15,040
photosynthesis, which allows the orchid

768
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:16,960
to absorb and fully convert nutrients

769
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,119
from the fertilizer, helping the plant

770
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:22,119
recover quickly and grow stronger each

771
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:22,119
day.

772
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:30,640
And here is the result after 6 weeks.

773
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,960
You can see the orchid has recovered

774
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:35,520
strongly with roots developing well.

775
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,359
that

776
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,280
uh the orchid continues to develop new

777
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:42,920
flower spikes, promising a brilliant

778
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,920
blooming season ahead.

779
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:49,440
These new roots will help the orchid

780
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:51,920
absorb more nutrients, enhancing

781
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:55,080
stability and vitality throughout its

782
00:48:51,920 --> 00:49:16,559
growth process.

[Music]

784
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:20,880
You can also see orchid leaves become

785
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,780
greener and sturdier, proving the

786
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:28,310
plant's improving health.

788
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:34,240
Uh, this orchid pot is the same. Many

789
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:36,240
new roots have grown and new flower buds

790
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,599
are developing strongly, signaling a

791
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,870
beautiful blooming season is

792
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:50,980
approaching.

794
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:56,480
Um, the calcium in the eggshells along

795
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:59,119
with the minerals in the rice water help

796
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,800
stimulate the growth of many new roots,

797
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:04,760
proving that the natural fertilizer

798
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:11,800
mixture is very effective.

800
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:15,520
Uh, rice water also helps improve the

801
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,079
plant's health by providing natural

802
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:20,370
vitamins and enzymes, supporting growth

803
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:26,480
and fighting pests.
