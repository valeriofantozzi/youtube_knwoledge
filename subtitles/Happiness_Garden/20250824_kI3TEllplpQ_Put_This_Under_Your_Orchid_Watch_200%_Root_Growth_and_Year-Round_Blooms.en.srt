Welcome to the Happiness Garden, where

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,879
we explore the beauty of nature together

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,480

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,000
care.

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,920
If you love orchids and wish to

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,719
propagate and care for your orchids so

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,320
they grow strong, lush, and bloom all

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,400

growing tips. It's truly wonderful to

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,920
have you along on this journey. Let's

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,680
get started.

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,480
This is an orchid that has finished

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,559
blooming and I bought it at a very low

18
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,520
price to restore, propagate, and help it

19
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,520
bloom again in future seasons.

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,520
After orchids finish blooming, they

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,520
usually have been through quite a long

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,239
period, so we need to carefully check

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,220
their roots and repot them to help the

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,480
plant grow healthier.

25
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,000
[Music]

26
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,239
Uh you can see that because the orchid

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,719
pot has been used for a long time, mold

28
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:07,159
has appeared on the growing medium which

29
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,159
negatively affects the plant's growth.

[Music]

31
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,880
If this situation is left untreated for

32
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,960
too long, it will cause root rot and

33
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,480
weaken the orchid, even risking the

34
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:24,400
plant's death.

35
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:27,040
[Music]

36
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,520
uh we need to remove all the moldy

37
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,119
growing medium and replace it with fresh

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,000
clean medium to provide the best

39
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,000
conditions for root growth.

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,759
Um next we will cut away all the damaged

41
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,560
roots to prevent disease spread and help

42
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,560
the plant recover faster.

46
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,720
The spots where the flower buds have

47
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:27,239
bloomed cannot bloom again and will not

48
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,239
develop into kiki baby plants.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,760
Uh these two nodes haven't bloomed yet,

50
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,000
so we can stimulate them to grow into

51
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,000
kiki baby plants or produce new flower

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
buds.

53
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,280
Um, that's why I cut off the spent

54
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,120
flower nodes so the nutrients won't be

55
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,120
scattered and can focus on supporting

56
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,120
the potential growth of Kiki baby

57
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,120

58
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,920
Next, I prepare a natural fertilizer to

59
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,840
help restore the orchid and stimulate

60
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,319
the growth of Kiki kegi baby plants on

61
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,319
the orchid cutting.

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,640
Take 3 tablespoons of oat flour as the

64
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,599
main ingredient to provide natural

65
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,599
nutrients for the orchid.

66
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,360
Add one liter of water to the oat flour

67
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,879
to dissolve it and create a natural

68
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,280
fertilizer mixture.

69
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,040
Cover the container and wait for 2 hours

70
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,460

71
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:47,530

73
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,480
Next, sprinkle turmeric powder on the

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,480
cut surface of the orchid cutting to

75
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,620

81

the orchid,

83
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,160
oat flour contains many natural vitamins

grow stronger and healthier.

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,360
The antioxidants in oat flour help boost

Next, plant the orchid into a new pot

133
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,720
I choose crushed pine bark as the

134
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,599
growing medium because it provides good

135
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,280

136
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:23,560

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,320
Using stakes to secure the orchid after

139
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,320
planting prevents the plant from shaking

After 30 minutes, remove the cotton.

After that, if you place the orchid pot

198
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,480
in a cool and humid area, the dormant

199
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,240
bud will grow into a kiki plantlet.

200
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,480
However, if you place it in a sunnier

201
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,959

202
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,959

Um, you can see that the roots have

205
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,839

The leaves have also become glossier and

You can see that the Kiki baby plant

cutting is sturdy and has strong roots,

247
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,399
we can completely separate and replant

248
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,639

269
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,120
When planting in the pot, we only need
