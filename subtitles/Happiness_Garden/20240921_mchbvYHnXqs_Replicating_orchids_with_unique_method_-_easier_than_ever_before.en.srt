00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:29,488
Welcome to my Happiness Garden channel.

2
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:39,296
When the last orchids on the branch are about to fall.

3
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:48,287
is when I cut branches to propagate orchids from flower stalks.

4
00:00:48,287 --> 00:00:57,132
Where flowers bloom, I cut off to go there.

5
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:06,212
At this node is the place where orchids can be propagated from flower stalks.

6
00:01:13,882 --> 00:01:40,808
I cut it back so the cut doesn't break the cut.

7
00:01:50,645 --> 00:02:02,634
Take 1 Amoxicillin tablet.

8
00:02:21,615 --> 00:02:44,901
Dab the cut with amoxilin to help it heal faster.

9
00:02:50,594 --> 00:02:58,598
Pour into a 500ml bottle of room temperature water.

10
00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:08,796
Then mix amocillin in water.

11
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:26,800
This is a plastic seed for growing aquaponic vegetables.

12
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:39,059
Soak in water mixed with amocillin for 30 minutes.

13
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:47,684
Helps kill fungi and bacteria very well.

14
00:03:51,286 --> 00:04:01,267
In the meantime, I recycle used plastic containers into orchid propagating tools.

15
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:55,394
Peeling off the film helps orchid sprouts to grow more easily.

16
00:05:22,444 --> 00:05:53,600
Use a sprig of fresh ginger.

17
00:05:58,832 --> 00:06:09,427
Then squeeze the pure ginger juice.

18
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:31,334
Dip cotton balls in ginger water.

19
00:06:47,933 --> 00:07:03,934
Incubate this button for 5 minutes to stimulate germination and fast rooting.

20
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:50,334
Put this button on the plastic pellets and spray moisturizing mist every 2 days.

21
00:07:52,507 --> 00:07:58,034
Place the flower pot in a cool and well-lit place.

22
00:08:05,228 --> 00:08:09,004
1 MONTH LATER.

23
00:08:17,087 --> 00:08:23,146
Sprouts have sprouted.

24
00:08:26,086 --> 00:08:30,099
But still no roots.

25
00:08:30,745 --> 00:08:37,759
Continue misting to moisturize every 2 days.

26
00:08:58,007 --> 00:09:02,934
AFTER THE NEXT 10 DAYS

27
00:09:03,964 --> 00:09:12,172
The orchid sprout has grown and has taken root.

28
00:09:29,355 --> 00:09:39,352
But the sprouts are still weak, so I continue to take care of them.

29
00:09:50,587 --> 00:09:54,583
AFTER THE NEXT 2 MONTHS.

30
00:10:00,755 --> 00:10:18,274
Orchids have grown very healthy.

31
00:10:24,011 --> 00:10:38,426
Roots grow very well.

32
00:10:57,436 --> 00:11:08,031
Now I plant it in a pot to let the orchid grow in the natural environment outside.

33
00:11:19,878 --> 00:11:29,875
Hope the video will help you in propagating orchids at home more easily.
