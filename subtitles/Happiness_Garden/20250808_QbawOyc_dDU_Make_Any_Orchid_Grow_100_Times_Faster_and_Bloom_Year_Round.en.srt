today's video, I will guide you on how

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,880
to make a new natural fertilizer that

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,200
helps orchids grow strong from roots to

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,759
leaves and continuously show off

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,280
brilliant flowers. Let's explore the

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,359
secret to caring for orchids so the

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,000

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,560
To make natural fertilizer, the first

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,279
ingredient I need to prepare is garlic.

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,440
A simple ingredient, but but rich in

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:37,640
valuable nutrients that help stimulate

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,640

16
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,320
You only need a small clove of garlic

17
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,320
and mince it very finely to maximize the

18
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,320
essence from the garlic for this natural

19
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,320

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,919
top and underside of the orchid leaves

79
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,919
to help the nutrients absorb deeply.

80
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,120
Wiping the leaves helps remove dust and

81
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,800
bacteria stuck on the leaf surface uh

82
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,479
thereby creating better conditions for

83
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,560

00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,840
penetrates through the leaf surface,

88
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,800
directly supplying essential nutrients,

89
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,639
helping the leaves become shiny and

90
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,240

Uh through the regular leaf wiping

94
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,400
process, you can also easily detect

95
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,960
early signs of abnormalities such as

96
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,720

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,120
indicates that the orchid is being

194
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,360
supplied with sufficient nutrients, is

195
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,920
healthy, and has good resistance to

196
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,920
external factors.

Next are the roots. You can easily

199
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,279
notice that both the roots inside the

200
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,920
pot and the aerial roots are growing

201
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,240
very strong and healthy. Proof of

202
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,760
effective nutrient absorption and the

203
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,480
ideal living environment that the plant

204
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,480
is being cared for.

206
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Uh when the root system is healthy, the

207
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,399
orchid will absorb water and nutrients

208
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,240
optimally, thereby promoting the plant's

209
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,240
comprehensive growth, helping the leaves

210
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,670
stay lush green and the flowers bloom

211
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:30,800
more regularly.

Therefore, roots are often compared to

214
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,519
the heart of the orchid, playing the

215
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,240
most important role in nurturing and

216
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,240
sustaining the life of the entire plant,

217
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,040

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,040

softer petals and vibrant, bright

228
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,519

butterflies gently resting on the

fertilizer made from garlic and molasses

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,880
not only helps the plants stay healthy

and bloom brilliantly, but is also safe,

244
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,240
environmentally friendly, and cost

245
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,959
effective compared to chemical
