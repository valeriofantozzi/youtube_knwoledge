Welcome to my channel

00:00:11,034 --> 00:00:18,983
Today I share the secret of quick recovery for orchids with yellow leaves and wilted leaves.

3
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:55,185
Cut off all damaged roots and yellow leaves.

4
00:01:14,504 --> 00:01:28,271
I use aloe vera leaves to restore growth and reactivate this orchid.

5
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:45,837
Aloe vera gel contains essential vitamins, amino acids, and minerals to help spread recovery quickly.

6
00:01:45,837 --> 00:02:06,046
Aloe vera gel is also a very good natural antiseptic. It helps to eliminate fungal diseases for orchids very quickly.

7
00:06:21,442 --> 00:06:39,170
Place the orchid in a sunny spot or by a window. Do not leave the orchid in a place with direct sunlight because the sun will make it easy to rot.

8
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:55,859
AFTER 1 WEEK

9
00:06:55,859 --> 00:07:07,757
new roots grow

10
00:07:07,757 --> 00:07:15,068
there is a new seedling growing

11
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:29,824
There's a new one growing here

12
00:07:36,536 --> 00:07:44,461
AFTER 2 MONTHS

13
00:07:50,707 --> 00:07:58,872
have lots of healthy roots growing

14
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:06,871
Welcome to part 2 of the video

15
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:18,868
In this video, I share about the mystery behind the growth speed of orchid roots that few people know.

16
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:30,899
These are orchids that people throw away.

17
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:42,897
The leaves of this tree are still fresh so I will restore them.

18
00:09:09,891 --> 00:09:19,889
This orchid's damage may be due to inorganic fertilizer shock.

19
00:09:25,888 --> 00:09:35,886
Orchid growing media contaminated with many molds are also harmful to orchids.

20
00:09:42,885 --> 00:09:52,883
We need to cut off all damaged branches, leaves, and roots.

21
00:09:56,882 --> 00:10:03,881
The roots were completely damaged.

22
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:16,878
The orchid stem has also completely dried up.

23
00:10:27,876 --> 00:10:36,874
Only 1 leaf left on the top is still fresh.

24
00:10:38,874 --> 00:10:46,872
Remove yellow leaves due to disease.

25
00:10:48,872 --> 00:10:56,870
then rinse with water.

26
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:30,897
Sprinkle cinnamon powder on the cut to help it heal quickly.

27
00:11:40,895 --> 00:11:47,893
Leave for 1 day without watering until the wound is completely healed before planting.

28
00:11:51,893 --> 00:12:01,891
Using vinegar helps reduce the pH of the soil, creating good conditions for the growth of orchids.

29
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:12,888
Take 3 tablespoons of vinegar.

30
00:12:15,888 --> 00:12:22,886
Honey is antibacterial and contains natural sugars such as glucose and fructose,

31
00:12:22,886 --> 00:12:29,885
 which help energize orchids and stimulate their growth.

32
00:12:30,885 --> 00:12:36,884
Take 1 teaspoon of honey.

33
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:46,882
Add 500ml of water.

34
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:06,878
Leave for 1 day before using.

35
00:13:09,877 --> 00:13:13,876
1 Day Later

36
00:13:29,873 --> 00:13:39,871
Wiping orchid leaves with this water helps eliminate fungi and bacteria that cause diseases in orchids.

37
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:15,897
Soak the leaf stalks in this water for 30 minutes.

38
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:23,896
This helps stimulate roots and sprouts to grow very quickly.

39
00:14:28,895 --> 00:14:33,894
The remaining water is used to irrigate other normal orchids.

40
00:14:38,893 --> 00:14:46,891
Helps roots grow healthily.

41
00:14:48,891 --> 00:14:58,889
The flowers bloom on the branches for a long time before fading.

42
00:15:12,886 --> 00:15:22,884
Fertilizing 1 to 2 times a month will help orchids bloom more and stay fresh longer.

43
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:36,881
The flowers bloom more brightly than usual.

44
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:51,878
Increases resistance to fungi and bacteria that cause orchid diseases.

45
00:16:20,873 --> 00:16:28,871
I use jute rope to grow orchids.

46
00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:46,867
Then wrap the jute rope around the leaf stem.

47
00:16:52,900 --> 00:17:00,898
Jute rope has the ability to absorb water and retain moisture very well.

48
00:17:26,893 --> 00:17:34,891
Pour filtered water into the jar.

49
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:51,888
This wire will absorb water to help keep the leaf drain moist.

50
00:17:55,887 --> 00:18:01,886
then put in a cool place.

51
00:18:02,886 --> 00:18:06,885
1 Month Later

52
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:19,882
You can see the roots are growing very well.

53
00:18:39,878 --> 00:18:49,876
and also grew another young leaf

54
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:11,872
If the roots grow healthy like this, plant it in a pot so it can grow in the outside environment.

55
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:38,900
