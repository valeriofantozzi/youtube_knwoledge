10
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:38,881
Put in a jar and soak with 2 liters of water for 2 hours.

11
00:01:51,878 --> 00:02:06,875
An orchid has withered leaves and is exhausted.

12
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:19,873
Cut off all flower stems.

13
00:02:29,871 --> 00:02:39,869
Then cut off all damaged roots.

14
00:03:01,898 --> 00:03:12,896
Rinse with water.

15
00:03:20,894 --> 00:03:30,892
Then leave it in a cool place and wait for the water to dry.

16
00:03:34,891 --> 00:03:38,890
AFTER 2 HOURS.

17
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:50,888
Filter out residue.

18
00:03:52,888 --> 00:04:02,886
Add water to make 3 liters of solution.

19
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:22,882
Add 3 Vitamin B1 tablets.

20
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:56,875
Soak for 20-30 minutes.

21
00:05:09,873 --> 00:05:19,871
Next I recycled the plastic box to help restore the orchid.

22
00:05:30,868 --> 00:05:38,900
Pour in some water.

23
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:26,891
Place the orchid branch in.

24
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:38,888
Regularly change the water when dirty.

25
00:06:45,887 --> 00:06:55,885
And keep the orchid pot in a cool place, away from direct sunlight.

26
00:07:07,883 --> 00:07:16,881
2 MONTHS LATER.

27
00:07:36,877 --> 00:07:46,875
The orchid has recovered, its leaves are green and strong.

28
00:07:55,873 --> 00:08:05,871
Roots grow very healthily.

29
00:08:06,871 --> 00:08:16,869
How do you find the way to restore your weak orchid? Please write a comment to let me know your opinion. 🌸

30
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:48,896
I continue to grow orchids in new pots using the semi-hydroponic method.

31
00:08:54,895 --> 00:09:04,893
This way of planting you will not have to water the orchids as much as with normal planting.

32
00:09:06,892 --> 00:09:12,891
Hope the video will help you a lot.

33
00:09:12,891 --> 00:09:18,890
