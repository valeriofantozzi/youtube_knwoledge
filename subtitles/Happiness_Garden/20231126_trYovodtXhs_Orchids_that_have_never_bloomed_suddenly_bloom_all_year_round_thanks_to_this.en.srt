00:00:08,899 --> 00:00:18,897
Today I share a solution to help orchids that have not yet bloomed.

3
00:00:18,897 --> 00:00:24,896
Can bloom many times a year

5
00:00:38,893 --> 00:00:48,891
When the last flower fades, the flower stem is still fresh.

6
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:59,889
I cut off all the wilted flowers.

7
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:08,887
This stimulates them to grow new flowers.

8
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:22,884
Buds will continue to grow in this location.

9
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:52,878
First I took 1 tablespoon of dry yeast.

10
00:01:54,878 --> 00:02:04,876
Mix with 1 liter of warm water.

11
00:02:16,873 --> 00:02:26,872
Then I took a piece of bread and soaked it in yeast.

12
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:40,869
This helps beneficial microorganisms grow faster.

13
00:02:43,868 --> 00:02:51,900
Cover and leave overnight.

14
00:03:01,898 --> 00:03:04,897
After 1 night.

15
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:16,895
Filter out residue.

16
00:03:31,892 --> 00:03:40,890
Add water to make 5 liters of solution.

17
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:50,888
First method.

18
00:03:54,887 --> 00:04:04,885
Apply this liquid fertilizer to the roots 1-2 times a month.

19
00:04:09,885 --> 00:04:19,883
The growth of beneficial microorganisms will invade harmful fungi in the orchid pot.

20
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:32,880
This helps protect orchid roots from rotting.

21
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:47,877
At the same time, the nutrients contained in this fertilizer are also very good for the growth of flowers and leaves.

22
00:04:53,876 --> 00:05:03,874
Because this type of fertilizer contains a lot of natural potassium and nitrogen.

23
00:05:07,873 --> 00:05:16,871
Orchids are very easy to absorb and grow.

24
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,869
Second method.

25
00:05:30,869 --> 00:05:40,900
You can also use this fertilizer to spray the entire orchid plant.

26
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:56,897
This method is similar to foliar fertilization for orchids.

27
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:12,894
Beneficial microorganisms also grow and protect orchids from fungal diseases.

28
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:24,891
Do not spray on flowers.

29
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:32,890
Because when wet, flowers will easily fall off.

30
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:38,888
Result.

31
00:06:41,888 --> 00:06:51,886
After using this fertilizer for 2 months, the leaves become stronger than usual.

32
00:07:00,884 --> 00:07:10,882
From the flower branches that have bloomed, suddenly more flower buds appear at the tips of the branches.

33
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:30,878
This helps orchids bloom again and again many times a year.

34
00:07:40,876 --> 00:07:50,874
And so my garden always has orchids blooming all year round.
