Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:16,897
In this video, I share the method of recovering weak orchids.

3
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:28,895
Helps them quickly take root and grow strongly.

4
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:42,892
I picked up a rotten orchid that someone had thrown away.

5
00:01:06,887 --> 00:01:16,885
All the roots have rotted.

6
00:01:18,885 --> 00:01:26,883
Which country are you watching this video from? Please comment and let me know!

7
00:01:26,883 --> 00:01:36,881
It's wonderful that we can connect and chat with each other from all around the world!

8
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:56,877
This original part has completely rotted so it can no longer be used.

9
00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:11,874
Wash orchid branches with water.

10
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:28,871
Then take 1 clove of garlic and mince it.

11
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:24,893
Add 500ml of water and soak for 30 minutes.

12
00:03:24,893 --> 00:03:31,892
Let the flower nutrition completely dissolve in water.

13
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,890
AFTER 30 MINUTES.

14
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:58,887
Wiping orchid branches with garlic water helps disinfect and eliminate fungal diseases.

15
00:04:22,882 --> 00:04:32,880
Then soak the orchid branches in garlic water for 10 minutes.

16
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:43,903
This helps stimulate root and shoot growth.

17
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,875
10 Minutes Later.

18
00:05:12,872 --> 00:05:22,870
because this orchid has many scars from previous insect bites.

19
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:31,868
So I waited a day for the orchid to dry completely before planting it.

20
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,899
1 Day Later.

21
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:53,897
I recycle sponges as orchid nursery tools.

22
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:36,889
Soaking the sponge in garlic water for 20 minutes helps disinfect and kill fungus.

23
00:06:46,887 --> 00:06:50,886
20 MINUTES LATER.

24
00:07:06,883 --> 00:07:16,881
Insert the orchid stem into the sponge and place it in the vase.

25
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:30,878
Pour some water into the jar and change it every time it gets dirty.

26
00:07:32,878 --> 00:07:40,876
Spray moisturizer every 3 days.

27
00:07:40,876 --> 00:07:50,874
and Place in a cool, well-lit place.

28
00:07:55,873 --> 00:07:59,872
5 WEEKS LATER

29
00:08:03,872 --> 00:08:10,870
The roots have grown very healthy.

30
00:08:17,869 --> 00:08:27,900
With this simple method, the roots have grown and the orchid has revived very well.

31
00:08:59,894 --> 00:09:09,892
I planted it in a pot so the orchid could grow better.

32
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:26,889

Welcome to part 2 of this video!

36
00:10:03,015 --> 00:10:07,880
In Part 2 of this video, I share how to care for orchids to help them grow and bloom.

37
00:10:10,013 --> 00:10:20,877
You can see that my orchids always develop new flower stems after the old flowers have fallen off.

38
00:10:25,877 --> 00:10:33,875
so my orchids bloom all year round.

39
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:39,874
bloom from branch to branch.

40
00:10:41,873 --> 00:10:46,873
The flowers on the stems take a long time to fall off. 

41
00:10:52,871 --> 00:10:59,870
They can even last up to 6 months before the petals drop.

42
00:11:05,869 --> 00:11:10,868
Many flowers grow on the same tree.

43
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:28,898
New roots grow a lot to help absorb nutrients best

44
00:11:32,897 --> 00:11:37,896
chubby flower buds

45
00:11:47,894 --> 00:11:52,893
Help flowers bloom long on branches

46
00:12:01,891 --> 00:12:06,890
brilliant flowers

47
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:12,889
How to make fertilizer as follows:

48
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:16,888
Use 1 small carrot weighing about 30g.

49
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,420
Cut into small pieces.

50
00:12:41,883 --> 00:12:45,882
Add 1 liter of filtered water.

51
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,880
Puree.

52
00:13:08,878 --> 00:13:12,877
filter out residue.

53
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:45,870
Add 1 liter of filtered water.

54
00:13:50,869 --> 00:14:00,867
Then, use cotton to soak carrot juice and wipe both the top and bottom sides of the leaves.

55
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:15,897
This method helps repel insects and open the stomata. 

56
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:22,896
The orchids will photosynthesize and exchange nutrients better.

57
00:14:33,894 --> 00:14:40,893
At the same time, orchids also absorb some nutrients through the leaves

58
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:07,888
Help keep the leaves green

59
00:15:41,881 --> 00:15:45,880
2nd way.

60
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:52,879
Water this carrot for orchids.

61
00:15:53,878 --> 00:15:58,877
Carrot juice is a good source of nutrients for orchids,

62
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:06,876
including vitamins and minerals like beta-carotene, potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus.

63
00:16:07,876 --> 00:16:11,875
When the carrot juice is poured into the orchid pot, 

64
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:15,874
it provides nutrients to the orchids and helps to promote their health. 

65
00:16:17,874 --> 00:16:23,872
In addition, carrot juice is also acidic, which helps regulate the pH of the potted soil

66
00:16:23,872 --> 00:16:28,871
and enhances the orchid's ability to absorb nutrients.

67
00:16:30,871 --> 00:16:38,870
You can soak the orchid pot in this carrot juice for 20 minute

68
00:16:39,869 --> 00:16:44,868
Do this 1-2 times a month

69
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:54,900
3rd way

70
00:17:06,897 --> 00:17:14,895
Mist moisturizing carrot juice for orchids by spraying both the top and bottom of the leaves. 

71
00:17:14,895 --> 00:17:20,894
This helps wash away dirt and eliminate insects on your orchids. 

72
00:17:20,894 --> 00:17:28,893
The nutrients in carrot juice support orchid health, helping them thrive and bloom beautifully.

73
00:17:33,892 --> 00:17:38,891
However, be careful not to over-water the carrot juice as it can clog the water channels in the orchid.

74
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:46,889
 Avoid spraying directly on flowers because it can cause flowers to fall off quickly.

75
00:17:47,889 --> 00:17:52,888
I hope this video helps you take better care of your orchids at home and encourages them to bloom easily.

Welcome to part 3 of today's video!

78
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:16,883
To give you more options for taking care of your orchids at home using organic fertilizer, in this video, 

79
00:18:16,883 --> 00:18:26,881
I continue to share methods for making natural fertilizer from everyday kitchen ingredients you can find in your home.

80
00:18:28,881 --> 00:18:36,880
Subscribe to the video so you don't miss any tips on my channel.

81
00:18:40,878 --> 00:18:42,878
Number 1:

82
00:18:42,878 --> 00:18:50,877
To make this fertilizer you need apples.

83
00:18:56,876 --> 00:19:06,874
Apples contain potassium, an important mineral for orchid growth.

84
00:19:12,872 --> 00:19:22,870
Potassium helps orchids develop stronger leaves, roots and flowers.

85
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:36,868
I took the apple peel and put it in a bottle.

86
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:50,898
Soak in boiled water and leave overnight.

87
00:20:09,894 --> 00:20:11,894
No. 2

88
00:20:12,893 --> 00:20:20,892
To make this type of fertilizer you need more eggshells.

89
00:20:41,888 --> 00:20:51,886
Soak the eggshells in boiled water and leave overnight.

90
00:21:06,883 --> 00:21:12,881
Leave overnight.

91
00:21:29,878 --> 00:21:38,877
After 1 night, filter the water.

92
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:29,900
So we have fertilizer from apples and eggshells.

93
00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:35,899
FIRST METHOD.

94
00:22:39,898 --> 00:22:48,896
Water this fertilizer solution on the orchid roots.

95
00:22:55,895 --> 00:23:05,893
Eggshells provide natural calcium which is very good for orchids. 

96
00:23:05,893 --> 00:23:16,891
Helps orchids stay healthy and increase resistance.

97
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:36,887
Apple peels contain a lot of Phosphorus, which is also an important nutrient for orchid growth.

98
00:23:41,886 --> 00:23:53,883
especially during the flowering and flower development stage.

99
00:24:00,882 --> 00:24:10,880
Do this 1-2 times/month to supplement nutrition and increase the orchid's resistance.

100
00:24:25,877 --> 00:24:29,876
SECOND METHOD.

101
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:46,873
Spray this fertilizer on the entire orchid.

102
00:24:52,872 --> 00:24:59,870
This method is similar to using foliar fertilizer.

103
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:16,867
Calcium in eggshells helps orchids stay healthy and increases their resistance to pests.

104
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:32,897
Apples contain nitrogen, an important nutrient.

105
00:25:33,897 --> 00:25:42,895
Helps orchids develop green parts and increase photosynthesis ability.

106
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:06,890
Do not spray on flowers.

107
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:15,889
Because wet flowers will easily fall off.

108
00:26:16,888 --> 00:26:20,888
THIRD METHOD

109
00:26:30,885 --> 00:26:38,884
Clean the leaf surface with this liquid fertilizer.

110
00:26:42,883 --> 00:26:48,882
The leaf surface will always be clean and airy.

111
00:27:00,879 --> 00:27:06,878
Orchids will photosynthesize better.

112
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:18,876
Fertilizing regularly 1-2 times/month will help keep the leaves healthy.

113
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:25,874
Number 3:

114
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:36,873
You can reuse eggshells and apple peels to make fertilizer again.

115
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:12,898
Let's check out the results together!

116
00:28:14,898 --> 00:28:22,897
This type of fertilizer stimulates rooting very quickly.

117
00:28:29,895 --> 00:28:39,894
After 1 month of use you will see great results.

118
00:28:44,893 --> 00:28:56,890
Many flower buds develop and do not fall.

119
00:29:10,887 --> 00:29:20,885
Blooming flowers stay on the branches for a long time before fading.

120
00:29:26,884 --> 00:29:36,882
Flowers can remain on branches for up to 6 months before falling.

121
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:56,878
Thank you for watching the video. Good luck and see you in the next videos!
