00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,400
Welcome to my little garden where orchid

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,080
branches begin a new journey.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,400
Today I will show you how to propagate

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,440
orchids from cutings. Simple and

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,440
effective right at home.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,520
This is my orchid. It it has finished

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,840
blooming and is ready for propagation.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,600
When the petals fade, it's the perfect

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,600
time to start propagating orchids from

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,600
cutings.

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,399
Cut off any damaged leaves so the plant

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,399
can grow stronger.

13
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,000
Cutting off damaged leaves helps

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,690
eliminate fungi, prevents the spread of

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,440
disease, and keeps the plant healthy.

16
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,039
[Music]

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,920
Next, trim off any damaged roots to

18
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,920
ensure the plant grows well.

19
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,160
[Music]

20
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,160
Uh, trimming off damaged roots helps

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,399
prevent mold growth and creates

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,610
conditions for new healthy roots to

23
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,840
grow.

00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,840
[Music]

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,920
Uh, identifying damaged roots is simple.

26
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,080
If the roots are soft, they are

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,640
completely damaged. If the roots are

28
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,920
still firm but have a dark brown color,

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,920
it is also a sign of damage.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,240
Please comment and let me know which

31
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,320
country you're watching the video from.

32
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,360
It's amazing that we can chat together

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,520
have you as a companion.

39
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,960
Next, trim off the faded petals. This

40
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,200
helps the plant conserve energy and get

41
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,119
ready for the next blooming cycle or for

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,680
producing baby plants on the stem if

43
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,680
properly stimulated.

44
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,079
[Music]

45
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,640
The nodes that have already bloomed will

46
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,319
not bloom again. and cannot produce baby

47
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,319
plants for baby from there.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Young nodes like this should not be used

49
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,959
for propagation as the dormant buds are

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,959
prone to rotting and damage.

51
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,760
Old nodes like this should also not be

52
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,160
used for propagation as the dormant buds

53
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,400
are very hard to develop.

54
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,560
This node is neither too old nor too

55
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,360
young, making it the ideal choice for

56
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,360
propagation from cutings.

57
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,040
Um, peeling off the protective layer of

58
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,800
the dormant bud helps nutrients absorb

59
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,640
better when stimulated, allowing the

60
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,640
baby plant to sprout quickly.

61
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,920
In addition to the English voiceover, uh

62
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,239
we have now created voiceovers in

63
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,480
French, German, Italian, Spanish,

64
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,640
Portuguese, Japanese, Hindi, and

65
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,120

66
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,560
understand the content more easily. To

67
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,879
listen to the language, open the video

68
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,760

71
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,000
For languages without voice over, we

72
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,280
have created subtitles to help you

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,280
easily read and understand the content.

74
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,239
Bananas when made into GE gel enzyme are

75
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,400
very effective in orchid propagation

76
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,720
from cutings helping to stimulate rapid

77
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,759
growth.

78
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,359
Bananas when made into GE gel enzyme are

79
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,600
very effective in orchid propagation

80
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,600
from cutings helping to stimulate rapid

81
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,600
growth.

82
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,639
Uh next take a pieces of gin to make GE

83
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,000
which helps enhance growth and fight

84
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,000
diseases during the propagation process.

85
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,080
Then place the sliced banana and ginger

86
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,720
into a glass or plastic jar to prepare

87
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,720
for making GE.

88
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,120
Make sure the jar is clean so that when

89
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:03,800
the GE fermentss, uh, the mixture

90
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,800
doesn't spoil and maintains its quality.

91
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,960
Next, add.5 L of water to make it easier

92
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,960
for the mixture to dissolve and ferment

93
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,960
effectively.

94
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,609
[Music]

95
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,400
Uh, leave some space in the jar so that

96
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,199
when it ferments, the GE will produce

97
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,560
gas and allow the fermentation process

98
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,880
to proceed smoothly.

99
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,479
Finally, add about 2 tesp of honey to

100
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,199
boost nutrients and stimulate the

101
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,199
fermentation process.

102
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,639
Stir the mixture well so that the

103
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,840
ingredients blend together and ferment

104
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,840
easily. Close

105
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,800
the lid and place it in a cool, airy

106
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,120
spot for 3 weeks. The mixture will

107
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,960
ferment and turn into a highly effective

108
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,960
GE for orchid propagation from cutings.

109
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,199
This is the GE product I made earlier.

110
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,000
Now all you need to do is take it out

111
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:39,000
and apply it for orchid propagation from

112
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
cutings.

113
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,639
Just take about 20 mil of this GE and

114
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,639
apply it to the orchid cutting.

115
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,080
Dilute the GE with one liter of water to

116
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,080
create an effective orchid propagation

117
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,080
solution.

118
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,360
Next, I add vitamin B1 to the mixture to

119
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,919
help stimulate root growth and enhance

120
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,919
the plant's health.

121
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,240
Add three vitamin B1 tablets to the

122
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,360
mixture to enrich it with nutrients,

123
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,360
helping the orchid grow stronger.

125
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,960
[Music]

126
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,199
Step one, use a soft cloth to soak up

127
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,199
the mixture. Then firmly attach it to

128
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,720
the node with the peeled dormant bud to

129
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,720
help the nutrients absorb effectively.

130
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,919
This helps stimulate the dormant bud to

131
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,399
sprout quickly and develop into a baby

132
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,399
orchid plant.

133
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,560
Step two, use a soft cloth to soak up

134
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,880
the mixture and gently wipe both the top

135
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,440
and bottom of the leaves to allow better

136
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,440
nutrient absorption.

138
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,920
This mixture helps enhance nutrients and

139
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,920
stimulates strong root development.

140
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,279
Vitamin B1 and the components in the

141
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,220
mixture help the plant resist diseases

142
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:35,360
and stress.

00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,519
[Music]

144
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,440
Wiping the leaves helps remove dirt,

145
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,920
creating a shiny surface that easily

146
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,920
absorbs light.

147
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,200
When the leaves are clean and healthy,

148
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,800
the plant will photosynthesize more

149
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,279
efficiently, helping the orchid grow

150
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,279
well.

151
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,800
Wiping the leaves with the mixture helps

152
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,279
the plant absorb nutrients through the

153
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,880
leaves more easily, especially when the

154
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,880
plant is young or weak after blooming.

[Music]

156
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,480
Then transfer the mixture into a spray

157
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,360
bottle for easy application on the

158
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,360
leaves and dormant buds.

159
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,079
Step three, spray this mixture on the

160
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,440
leaves, stem, and roots of the orchid to

161
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,440
provide the plant with complete

162
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,440
nutrients.

163
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,760
Spraying the mixture helps the orchid

164
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,160
recover after pruning or during the

165
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:12,200
propagation process, promoting quick

166
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,200
recovery and rapid growth.

167
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,480
Spraying helps maintain the ideal

168
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,800
humidity for the orchid, especially in

169
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,800
dry environments.

170
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,880
The mixture, when sprayed, helps

171
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,480
stimulate rapid root growth, especially

172
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,480
when the plant is in the propagation

173
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,480
stage.

174
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,880
Step four, spray the mixture onto this

175
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,320
cotton pad to boost nutrients and

176
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,320
support strong growth of the dormant

177
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,320
bud.

178
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,839
Wait about 20 minutes for the nutrients

179
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,320
to absorb into the dormant bud before

180
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,320
removing the cotton.

181
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,880
The leftover mixture in the bottle can

182
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,040
be used to spray on other orchids in the

183
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,760
garden. It will be very beneficial for

184
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,920
their growth.

185
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,320
For healthy orchids, apply once or twice

186
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,880
a month. For orchids being stimulated to

187
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:22,760
sprout keis, apply three to four times a

188
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,760
month for best results.

189
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,240
Step five, water the orchid pot with

190
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,200
this mixture to stimulate the growth of

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,200
keis on the spike.

192
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,600
Um, water each pot with about 10

193
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,000
tablespoons to provide enough nutrients

194
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,000
for the plant.

195
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,440
When watering with this mixture, it will

196
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,360
provide nutrients that help the dormant

197
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,480
buds on the flower spike grow quickly

198
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,480
and sprout into keakis.

199
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,240
Watering with this mixture helps the

200
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,560
orchid become healthier, increasing its

201
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,519
ability to endure and thrive during the

202
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,600
propagation process.

203
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,360
Apply this to the orchid three to four

204
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:10,040
times a month to effectively stimulate

205
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,040
the dormant buds to sprout into keis.

206
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,519
Step six, use a soft cloth to wipe off

207
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,360
any excess mixture on the leaves and

208
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,959
between the leaf crevices to prevent the

209
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,240
plant from staying too moist for too

210
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,240

After about 20 minutes, remove the cloth

217
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,440
from the dormant bud to allow the

218
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,680
nutrients to have fully absorbed into

219
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,680

You can see that the kei has sprouted

223
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:16,360
and is quite healthy. Uh proving that

224
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,360
this method is very effective.

225
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,120
Although small, the kei already has

226
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:27,000

228
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,199
The mother orchid has also grown many

not yet ready to be separated and

248
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,559

Plant in pots to let the orchid adapt

382
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,679

Remember to plant the root higher than

397
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,720
the pot so that the orchid does not have

398
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,720
root rot.
