Welcome to my Happiness Garden channel.

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:22,896
Orchids rot and people throw them away.

3
00:00:26,752 --> 00:00:36,893
If the orchid is rotten but the leaves are still fresh, we can still revive it so it can grow strongly.

4
00:00:37,425 --> 00:00:46,891
This orchid has completely rotten roots.

5
00:00:48,761 --> 00:01:00,888
The leaves appear to have been eaten by worms

6
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:12,886
Rinse with water after removing all rotten parts.

7
00:01:22,695 --> 00:01:32,882
Remove cuts caused by insect bites.

8
00:01:42,892 --> 00:02:00,877
Sprinkle cinnamon powder on the cut.

9
00:02:26,535 --> 00:02:36,869
Take 500ml of water.

10
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:58,898
Add 3 vitamin B1 tablets.

11
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:26,893
Take okra and cut it into thin slices.

12
00:03:34,027 --> 00:03:46,889
Soak okra in Vitamin B1 water for 10 minutes.

13
00:03:50,919 --> 00:04:02,886
Then soak the orchid branches in this solution for 30 minutes.

14
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:26,881
Recycle plastic boxes into orchid nursery tools.

15
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:41,878
30 Minutes later.

16
00:04:44,946 --> 00:04:54,875
Apply okra gel to the entire orchid.

17
00:04:56,875 --> 00:05:10,872
This helps the orchid stay moist and take root quickly.

18
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:31,868
Then place in a cool place to let the orchid dry naturally.

19
00:06:13,351 --> 00:06:23,891
Place industrial cotton under the tree.

20
00:06:45,943 --> 00:06:51,886
Pour some water into the glass.

21
00:06:52,319 --> 00:07:00,884
Place the orchid in a cup of water but don't let the leaves touch the water.

22
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:11,882
Then spray moisturizer every 5 days.

23
00:07:20,888 --> 00:07:32,877
When water does not touch the leaves, it will help the orchid have enough moisture and not cause the leaves to rot.

24
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:46,875
Place in a cool place.

25
00:07:48,874 --> 00:07:52,874
1 Month later.

26
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:26,900
The orchid has grown very strong roots.

27
00:08:39,835 --> 00:08:49,896
If you find the video meaningful, please support me by clicking like and sharing so more people know.

28
00:09:19,038 --> 00:09:29,888
Now I plant it in a pot so the orchid can grow in an outside environment.

29
00:09:36,192 --> 00:09:45,884
I used aquaponic plastic beads and terracotta spread underneath.

30
00:09:45,884 --> 00:09:55,882
and spread moss on the surface to help retain moisture better.

31
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:10,880
Hope the video will help you a lot.

32
00:10:16,007 --> 00:10:26,876
Wishing you success and happiness in life. Goodbye and see you again in the next videos.
