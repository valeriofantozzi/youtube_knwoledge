4
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:39,226
You see this is a withered and weak orchid.

5
00:00:39,226 --> 00:00:49,324
If not restored, the orchid will die or will never bloom.

6
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:07,087
First you need to cut off all damaged roots.

7
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:41,747
and cut dried flower stems.

8
00:01:50,872 --> 00:01:59,843
Fix the orchid so that it will not damage the roots when it roots later.

9
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:20,873
Then take 5 spoons of rice.

10
00:02:32,174 --> 00:02:40,169
Add 2 liters of water at room temperature.

11
00:02:43,601 --> 00:02:50,633
Wait 30 minutes before using.

12
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:11,663
then take 2 spoons of milk.

13
00:03:20,738 --> 00:03:28,892
Add 1 liter of water at room temperature.

14
00:03:45,522 --> 00:03:55,521
Then thoroughly wipe the top and bottom of the leaf.

15
00:03:55,521 --> 00:04:06,785
This helps remove dirt, fungus and disease-causing bacteria on orchids.

16
00:04:08,785 --> 00:04:18,149
At the same time, adding nutrients through the leaves helps the orchid recover quickly

17
00:04:25,088 --> 00:04:28,881
after 30 minutes.

18
00:04:53,770 --> 00:05:03,874
Mix milk solution with rice water as fertilizer.

19
00:05:15,623 --> 00:05:22,870
Adding moss helps retain moisture better.

20
00:05:35,078 --> 00:05:45,065
From now on, water your orchids with this liquid fertilizer once a week.

21
00:05:45,065 --> 00:05:55,363
Should be done in the morning before the sun is hot.

22
00:05:59,428 --> 00:06:09,894
On normal days, the substrate is dry, just watering to keep it moist is enough.

23
00:06:17,526 --> 00:06:26,891
Place the orchid pot in a cool, well-lit place and the plant will recover faster and the plant will be healthy.

24
00:06:28,645 --> 00:06:32,889
1 Month Later

25
00:06:37,284 --> 00:06:46,887
The orchid has developed many new roots.

26
00:06:54,478 --> 00:07:04,883
Many branched roots develop to help absorb nutrients and water better.

27
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:31,878
Hopefully the video will help you a lot in taking better care of orchids at home.

28
00:07:50,341 --> 00:07:59,872
Thank you for watching the video. Good luck and see you in the next videos.
