00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:09,881 --> 00:00:19,863
When the last Phalaenopsis orchids are about to fall.

3
00:00:24,437 --> 00:00:34,427
This is the right time to cut branches to propagate phalaenopsis orchids from flower stems.

4
00:00:42,335 --> 00:00:52,323
This is where dormant sprouts should be kept for propagation.

5
00:00:54,813 --> 00:01:02,726
And this place is already blooming so let's cut it.

6
00:01:36,861 --> 00:01:46,846
And here is a potato.

7
00:02:03,352 --> 00:02:15,807
Potatoes contain many substances necessary for the growth of orchids.

8
00:02:27,808 --> 00:02:37,783
I will recycle potato peels into organic fertilizer.

9
00:02:40,303 --> 00:02:50,333
Pour 1 liter of hot water into the jar.

10
00:02:51,034 --> 00:02:58,369
then brew until the water cools.

11
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:11,596
Need to peel off the protective film of the sleeping sprout.

12
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:24,127
This will help the sprouts grow faster.

13
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:54,402
Apply potato gel to the sleeping sprouts.

14
00:03:59,805 --> 00:04:09,784
This helps stimulate sprout growth.

15
00:04:14,815 --> 00:04:24,781
Next, apply toothpaste on the cut.

16
00:04:28,036 --> 00:04:38,286
Helps cuts heal faster.

17
00:04:52,276 --> 00:05:02,274
Wrap with thinly sleced potatoes.

18
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:26,159
This helps moisturize and awaken dormant sprouts.

19
00:05:32,135 --> 00:05:44,301
Leave for 6 hours to let the nutrients from the potatoes penetrate inside.

20
00:05:48,734 --> 00:05:55,734
Take 1 teaspoon of cinnamon powder.

21
00:05:57,387 --> 00:06:07,293
Add 1 liter of hot water.

22
00:06:18,074 --> 00:06:37,033
After the water cools, filter to remove sediment.

23
00:06:48,096 --> 00:06:58,084
Soak terracotta beads and aquaponic resin beads in cinnamon water solution for 30 minutes.

24
00:07:10,993 --> 00:07:19,639
Soak the moss in the cinnamon solution for 30 minutes.

25
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:09,267
Recycle used boxes into orchid sprouting tools.

26
00:08:24,488 --> 00:08:51,697
Conduct orchid nursery.

27
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:07,367
Spray moisturizer every 3 days.

28
00:09:10,352 --> 00:09:18,196
Place in a cool place.

29
00:09:27,184 --> 00:09:34,867
When cool, filter to remove residue.

30
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:43,221
Watering this liquid fertilizer for orchids 1-2 times/month will be very good.

31
00:09:58,176 --> 00:10:02,148
3 WEEKS LATER.

32
00:10:10,598 --> 00:10:21,994
The sleeping sprouts have awakened.

33
00:10:46,266 --> 00:10:57,833
Continue spraying water and leave in a cool place for the sprouts to grow.

34
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:18,031
AFTER NEXT 1 MONTH.

35
00:11:18,495 --> 00:11:28,631
The sprout has grown leaves.

36
00:11:45,007 --> 00:11:54,992
Continue spraying water and leave in a cool place for the sprouts to grow.

37
00:12:09,016 --> 00:12:12,989
AFTER THE NEXT 2 MONTH.

38
00:12:16,312 --> 00:12:26,286
Small orchids grow very quickly.

39
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:46,117
With this simple way you can propagate orchids at home easily.

40
00:12:51,309 --> 00:13:01,301
Hope the video will help you a lot.

41
00:13:04,962 --> 00:13:12,929
Now I will plant it in a pot so the orchid can grow in the outside environment.

42
00:13:15,126 --> 00:13:25,121

45
00:13:49,869 --> 00:13:59,867
Don't rush to leave the video because in the next part I will share how to propagate with another type of orchid.

46
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:06,899
Welcome to this video! This is a dendrobium orchid.

47
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:13,898
a type of orchid that is said to be beautiful and has a gentle fragrance.

48
00:14:14,898 --> 00:14:22,896
In this video I share an easy way to propagate the most beautiful orchids in the world?

And share so as many people know.

51
00:14:39,893 --> 00:14:43,892
Let's get started!

52
00:14:47,891 --> 00:14:55,890
I cut this old orchid for propagation.

53
00:15:02,888 --> 00:15:09,887
Cut again so the cut is flat and will not rot further.

54
00:15:16,886 --> 00:15:26,884
Applying cinnamon powder to the cut helps the wound heal quickly and not rot.

55
00:15:28,883 --> 00:15:36,882
Then wait a day for the cutting to dry completely before planting the orchid.

56
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,880
1 Day Later.

57
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:55,678
Take 1 aloe vera leaf and cut it into thin slices.

58
00:15:56,678 --> 00:16:05,676
Aloe vera gel is very good at restoring wilted orchids and reviving baby orchids.

59
00:16:06,676 --> 00:16:15,674
Then take 2 cloves of garlic and cut them into thin slices.

60
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:24,672
Garlic has antibacterial and antiseptic properties that help protect orchids from rotting.

61
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:45,668
Put garlic and aloe vera in the jar and add 500ml of water.

62
00:17:15,695 --> 00:17:22,694
The cut is completely dry.

63
00:17:29,693 --> 00:17:38,691
Soaking in this water for 30 minutes helps stimulate germination and rooting.

64
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:50,688
Recycle used plastic bottles as orchid nursery tools.

65
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:40,679
Then put the dry orchid branches into this plastic bottle.

66
00:18:49,677 --> 00:18:58,675
Place the bottle here and insert moss around it to help retain moisture.

67
00:19:33,668 --> 00:19:43,699
Water regularly to keep the environment moist.

68
00:19:45,699 --> 00:19:52,698
This helps the orchid germinate faster.

69
00:20:09,694 --> 00:20:19,692
Then put it in a cool place and wait for the orchid to revive.

70
00:20:23,691 --> 00:20:26,691
45 Days Later.

71
00:20:59,684 --> 00:21:08,683
With this method, after only 45 days, old withered orchid branches have been revived.

72
00:21:43,676 --> 00:21:48,675
Now I cut them out to plant in pots.

73
00:21:51,674 --> 00:21:59,672
I plant with pine bark soaked in antiseptic to prevent the tree from rotting.

74
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:20,668
Adding a little moss helps retain moisture and protect the roots better.

75
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:50,696
Then you water it to keep it moist and take care of it like other normal orchids.

76
00:22:51,695 --> 00:22:58,894
Thank you for watching the video! Wishing you luck and happiness in life!
