00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,159
quickly uh you cut off Old Flower

25
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:28,880
branches so that the Orchid can focus on

26
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,880

okra okra is an excellent natural

37
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,060

40
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,640
next I use potatoes as natural

41
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,640
fertilizer to restore the

42
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,599
Orchid potatoes are rich in starch

43
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,599
providing essential energy for orchid

44
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:56,480
growth uh potatoes are packed with

45
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,920
minerals like pottassium phosphorus and

46
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,560
vitamin B6 which stimulate root

47
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,560
development and promote healthy Orchid

48
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,959
growth put the okra and Cho potatoes in

49
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,959
the jar

50
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,840
add 1 liter of water

51
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,040
close the

52
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,400
lid wait overnight for the nutrients to

53
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,400
dissolve into the

54
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,199
water next I use oatmeal as a natural

55
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,919
fertilizer take 3 tbsp of oatmeal

56
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:48,919
add 1 liter of

57
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,629

residue step

66
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:57,319
one use a soft cloth to gently wipe the

67
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,199
top and bottom of the orchid leaves with

68
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:01,639
the okra and potato soaked water

solution

70
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,120
removes dust and residue improving the

71
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,120
plant's ability to

72
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,120
photosynthesize the okra and potato

73
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,440
solution supplies natural nutrients

74
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,440
through the leaves

75
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,919
leaves become shinier softer and

76
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,759
healthier the solution may form a

77
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:55,479
protective layer reducing the risk of

78
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:55,479
pest infestations on orchid leaves

79
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:06,080
gently wipe each Leaf both the upper and

80
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,479

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,479
evenly

82
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,479

87
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,680
two put this solution in a spray bottle

88
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,680
and Mist the entire orchid

90
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,800
in dry conditions

91
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:11,599
spraying ensures the solution covers the

00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:11,599
entire plant from Roots to stems and

93
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,240

98
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:42,240

00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,240
orchid leaves

103
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,040
water pooling on leaves especially in

104
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,040
crevices can cause rot if left too

105
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,920
long a damp environment can attract

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:55,560
polysaccharides and natural starches to

117
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,560
encourage longer stronger roots

118
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,920
then you water the Orchid roots with

119
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,920
