Today, I continue to share with you how

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,160
to care for your orchids at home using

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,160
homemade fertilizer. Simple but

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,160
effective.

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,320
Um, with this method, your orchid will

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,240
not only stay healthy, but can also

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,680
bloom continuously, bringing lasting

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,920
beauty to your little garden.

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,760
You will see new flower buds quietly

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,320
gives to its caretaker.

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,020
And after a short time, the leaves will

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,120

Uh to make this natural fertilizer, we

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,520
will need bananas, a familiar ingredient

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,069
that is rich in potassium and essential

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,280

30
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,640
Before using, you should wash the banana

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,080
thoroughly, especially the peel, as it

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,400
may still contain traces of

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,479
preservatives. This cleaning step helps

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,880
ensure your natural fertilizer is safer

35
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,880
for the plant and more environmentally

36
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,880

flower growth, but also naturally and

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:50,799

42
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,159
Cut about 20 g of banana, just enough to

43
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,150

balance the pH of the solution and

56
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,360
supports mild fermentation, which

57
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,519
enhances the breakdown of nutrients in

58
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,480
the banana, making them easier for the

59
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,120

You can use white vinegar, apple cider

63
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,200

the lid tightly and let it sit overnight

68
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,239
in a cool, ventilated place. During this

69
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,720

70
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,560

surface. This helps you detect signs of

193
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,399
pests, leaf spots, or abnormalities in

194
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,920
time, allowing for early treatment and

195
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,920
more effective protection of your

196
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,920
orchid.

197
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,440
Regularly wiping the leaves with a

198
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,240
natural solution also helps them become

199
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,080
glossier and healthier. This is not only

200
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,240
a sign of a well-rowing plant, but also

201
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,800
adds to the orchid's vibrant, lively,

202
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,800
and radiant appearance.

203
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,120
You only need to wipe the leaves with

204
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,120
this solution about one to two times a

205
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,120
month.

206
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,040
Method two, you can pour the solution

207
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,040
into a spray bottle for more convenient

208
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,040
use.

209
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,880
With this method, simply spray a light

210
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,880
mist onto both the underside and top

211
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,040
side of the leaves. This helps the

212
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:11,959
fertilizer absorb quickly while keeping

213
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,959
the leaf surfaces cool and fresh.

214
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,360
When spraying the solution onto the

215
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,600
leaves, the nutrients from the banana

216
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,360
quickly penetrate through the epidermis,

217
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,360
allowing the plant to absorb them

218
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,040
directly without waiting for root

219
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,880
uptake.

220
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,800
This is an effective way to supplement

221
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,839
micronutrients, especially during

222
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,839
recovery or before blooming.

223
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,120
The fine mist from the spray bottle

224
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,600
helps maintain stable moisture levels on

225
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,079
the leaves, especially on hot days or

226
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,079
when the air humidity is low. This

227
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,839
prevents the leaves from drying out,

228
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,959
reduces stress, and keeps the plant

229
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,959
looking naturally fresh.

230
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,640
Method three, you can use the diluted

231
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,480
solution to water directly at the base

232
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,320
of the plant, allowing the roots to

233
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,720
absorb nutrients naturally and

234
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,040
effectively. This is a way to care from

235
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,040
the inside out, nourishing the entire

236
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,839
plant from roots to tip, helping the

237
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:22,440
roots grow strong. The leaves stay lush

238
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,440
green and the flowers bloom longer.

239
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,639
The banana and vinegar solution has a

240
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,440
mild acidity that creates an unfavorable

241
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,440
environment for fungi and certain pests.

242
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,440
Regular watering with it not only

243
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:40,200
nourishes the plant, but also helps

244
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,200
protect the orchid from harmful agents.

245
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,600
After watering, you can let the orchid

246
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,680
pot soak in the solution for about 20

247
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,839
minutes to allow the roots to fully

248
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,000
absorb the nutrients, soften the growing

249
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:55,000
medium, and support the plant's overall

250
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
recovery.

251
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,320
Um, you can use the remaining solution

252
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,240
to spray on other orchids that are

253
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,639
growing normally in your garden. This is

254
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,560
a great way to gently uh provide

255
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,399
nutrients, helping the plants maintain

256
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,399
vitality and grow steadily.

257
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,320
For orchids that have finished blooming,

258
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,800
this type of fertilizer will help the

259
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,440
plant recover quickly, nourish the roots

260
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,760

261
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:25,480
leaf growth, and prepare energy for the

262
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,480
next blooming cycle.

263
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,880
For blooming orchids, the natural banana

264
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,959
fertilizer provides gentle nutrition,

265
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,040
helping the flowers last longer, the

266
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,279
colors stay vibrant, and the leaves

267
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,279
remain healthy, creating a solid

268
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:43,170
foundation for the plant to maintain its

269
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:44,560
beauty throughout the blooming season.

271
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,639
Uh, after soaking for about 20 minutes,

272
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,940
gently take the orchid pot out of the

273
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,839
solution.

274

[Music]

275
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,199
Use a soft cloth to absorb any remaining

276
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,000
water droplets on the leaf surfaces and

277
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,000
between the leaf joints.

278
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,240
This step helps prevent water

279
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,240
accumulation that can cause leaf rot

280
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,240
while keeping the plant dry, clean, and

281
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,240
healthy.

282
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,000
In addition, wiping off the remaining

283
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,240
water helps improve the plant's

284
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,560
photosynthesis process.

285
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,839
When the leaf surface is clean and dry,

286
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,600
light can more easily reach the

287
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,839
epidermis, thereby promoting more

288
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,839
effective light absorption and energy

289
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,839

After finishing the care, place the

orchid pot in a cool, well ventilated

293
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,920
spot with gentle light in the early

294
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,079

changes

301
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,040
from the old flower spike after being

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,199
properly cared for. Over time, new

303
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,800
flower branches have started to grow.

304
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,959
This is a sign that the orchid has not

moments of budding, fading, and rising

way.

391
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,919
The revival of an orchid pot not only

392
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,000
brings small daily joy, but also

393
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,080
contributes to creating a fresh,

394
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,240

have you along.

401
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,320
Let's get started.

402
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,670
[Music]

403
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,600
Uh, the first ingredient I choose to

404
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,919
make natural fertilizer is used coffee

405
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,400
grounds. Those small and seemingly

406
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,160
useless, coffee grounds contain many

407
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,840
beneficial nutrients that help improve

408
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:18,720
the soil and stimulate root development.

409
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,799
Just take about 20 g of used coffee

410
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,039
grounds and mix them with one liter of

411
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,039
warm water.

412
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:30,320
The second ingredient I use is molasses,

413
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,159
also known as blackstrap molasses. This

414
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,400
is a mineralrich ingredient that

415
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,640
provides a natural source of energy,

416
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,919
helping orchids absorb nutrients more

417
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,919
effectively and boosting their

418
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,919
resistance.

419
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,360
You only need one teaspoon of blackstrap

420
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,370
molasses to mix with the watering

421
00:20:45,360 --> 00:21:04,029
solution.

422
00:20:46,370 --> 00:21:04,029
[Music]

423
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,919
The next ingredient is proby yogurt.

424
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,000
Thanks to its natural probiotics and

425
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,679
enzymes, yogurt helps improve the

426
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,159
microbial environment in the growing

427
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,679
medium, supports nutrient absorption,

428
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,480
and stimulates stronger root

429
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,480
development.

430
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,840
Just one spoonful of probiotic yogurt is

431
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,840
enough.

432
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,600
After adding all the ingredients, stir

433
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:45,400
well, cover tightly, and let the mixture

434
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,400
sit for a day to ferment.

435
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,579
[Music]

436
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,559
The fermentation process will activate

437
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,559
beneficial microorganisms, making the

438
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,150
fertilizer more effective when used on

439
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,400
orchids.

440
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:08,240
[Music]

441
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,159
When an orchid is kept in the same pot

442
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,000
for too long, the roots can easily

443
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,559
become suffocated and rot due to

444
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,520
prolonged moisture. This can lead to

445
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,520
root rot and leaf decay.

446
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,480
From the outside, the roots may still

447
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,720
look healthy and green, but in reality,

448
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,360
they might have already started to rot

449
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,120
inside. These signs are often hard to

450
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,679
detect without careful inspection, and

451
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:36,480
the orchid can gradually weaken without

452
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,720
you even realizing it.

[Music]

454
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,520
When the roots are water logged and lack

455
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:45,360
ventilation, the orchid will quickly

456
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,200
weaken.

457
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,880
The leaves start turning yellow, become

458
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,600
soft and limp, and are highly

459
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,120
susceptible to fungal infections. This

460
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,960
is a clear sign that the growing

461
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:59,159
environment is no longer suitable, and

462
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,159
the plant needs timely rescue.

463
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,640
Therefore, it's best to repot the orchid

464
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,960
after about a year and a half to provide

465
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,590
better ventilation and a healthier

466
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:22,670
environment for the plant.

468
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,799
As you can see, white fungal spots have

469
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,960
started to appear on the roots. a clear

470
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:35,440
sign that the orchid pot has become too

471
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:37,280
cramped and lacks proper ventilation.

472
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,200
When air circulation and moisture are

473
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,120
not balanced, fungal infections can

474
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,960
easily develop and attack the root

475
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,640
system.

476
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,880
At this point, you may also notice some

477
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,880
roots becoming hollow due to internal

478
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,880
rotting.

[Music]

480
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,799
At this stage, what you need to do is

481
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,280
cut off all the damaged, rotten or

482
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:03,200
hollow roots. This is an important step

483
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,600
to prevent the spread of fungal

484
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,679
infections and to create the conditions

485
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,679
for the orchid to recover in a healthy

486
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,679
way.

487
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,880
Uh with growing media that has been used

488
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,880
for a long time without being replaced

489
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,720
or treated, there is a high risk of

490
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,440
attracting harmful insects, especially

491
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,440
slugs and snails.

492
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:45,440
Because when the growing medium stays

493
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,200
moist for too long, it forms a slimy

494
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,440
moss layer which becomes an ideal

495
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:53,000

502
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,080
infected spots can quickly spread to

503
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,679
healthy parts of the leaves, making the

504
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,679
orchid weaker and harder to recover.

After treating the roots and leaves, the

510
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,400
next step is to clean the old growing

eliminate any remaining bacteria, fungi,

for the orchid to grow back healthily.

516
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:14,799
Just take one teaspoon of baking soda

517
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:17,120
and mix it with water. Baking soda has

518
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:19,919
mild antibacterial properties that help

519
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,080
clean the old growing medium and prevent

520
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,690
mold, creating a safer environment for

fungi, and insects before reuse.

528
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,039
Soak the orchid roots and growing medium

529
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,799
in this mixture for about 20 minutes.

530
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:11,279
This is the ideal amount of time for the

531
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,520
antibacterial properties to take effect,

534
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,400
In addition to its disinfecting effect,

535
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,880
the baking soda solution also helps

00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:27,520
balance the pH in the growing medium. As

537
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,840
a result, the growing environment

538
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,840
becomes more stable, allowing the orchid

539
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:36,039
roots to absorb nutrients more

540
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,039
effectively and grow healthier.

541
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,880
Uh while waiting for the roots and

542
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,440
growing medium to soak, you can use a

underside of the leaves.

546
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,320
Wiping the leaves with the baking soda

547
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:03,000

Uh when the leaves are clean, the plant

550
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,520
can carry out photosynthesis more

551
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,660
effectively, which in turn supports the

552
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:15,739
orchid's growth and development.

fungal spores and bacteria from the

557
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,559
leaves. Regular wiping reduces the risk

558
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:28,080
of yellowing, rotting, or the appearance

559
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:31,080
of disease spots caused by

560

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,440
Uh to prepare the new growing medium, I

562
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,000
use crushed pine bark as the main

563

564
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,399

00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,760
water droplets on the leaf surfaces and

758
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,760
in the leaf axles.

759
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,839
Wiping off water droplets helps

760
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:24,480
eliminate moist environments where mold

761
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:26,720
and bacteria can easily grow. As a

762
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:30,760
result, the leaves stay healthy and are

763
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,760
less prone to fungal diseases.

764
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,160
When the leaves no longer have water

765
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:38,480
droplets, their surfaces become clean,

766
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,760
allowing light to reach them more easily

767
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,760
and supporting more efficient

768
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,760
photosynthesis.

769
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,040
Water trapped in the leaf axles can

770
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,839
attract small insects like aphids or

771
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:52,000
mites. Wiping it dry helps reduce the

772
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:55,119
risk of these pests nesting and harming

773
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,440
the plant.

774
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:01,880
Then gently take the orchid pot out and

775
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,880
place it in a spot with gentle sunlight.

776
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,000
Gentle light will help the plant absorb

777
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,400
the necessary energy without causing

778
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:17,079
stress or leaf burn, creating an ideal

779
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,079
environment for recovery and growth.

[Music]

781
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:42,079
And here is the wonderful result after 3

782
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:43,680
weeks of care and recovery.

783
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,400
You can see the newly developed root

784
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:48,720
system is dense and healthy, proving the

785
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,720
effectiveness of the care and recovery

786
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,720
process.

787
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:02,960
The leaves become glossy green, healthy,

788
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:04,560
and firm, reflecting vibrant vitality

789
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,760
and the plant's optimal ability to

790
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,760
absorb nutrients from its surroundings.

791
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,079
This is a clear sign of an orchid that

792
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,079
is recovering well and growing

793
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,079
healthily.

[Music]

795
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,480
These roots will help the orchid absorb

796
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:40,839
more nutrients, creating a strong

797
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,839
foundation for sustainable growth.

798
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:45,599

799
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,920

800
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:50,400

Um, as long as you are patient and care

805
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,800
with the right techniques, the orchid

806
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,040
will not disappoint you. It will bloom

807
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,960
brilliantly, showing off its vibrant

808
