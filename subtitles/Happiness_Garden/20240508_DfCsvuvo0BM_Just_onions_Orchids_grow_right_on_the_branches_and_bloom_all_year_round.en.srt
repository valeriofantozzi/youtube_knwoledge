Welcome to my channel

2
00:00:22,996 --> 00:00:27,995
Today I share how to propagate orchids from flower stems using a new, extremely easy method

3
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:33,994
so that you have many different ways to choose from for propagating orchids.

4
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:06,987
Pry off the membrane so the sprouts can grow easily

5
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:13,986
Use about 10g of onion

6
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:54,978
Squeeze the onion juice

7
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,969
Wait 5 minutes for the onion juice to penetrate the orchid

8
00:02:42,968 --> 00:02:44,968
AFTER 5 MINUTES

9
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,999
Wait for the cut to dry

10
00:03:03,997 --> 00:03:08,997
Use tree bark glue (TREE SEAS)

11
00:03:08,997 --> 00:03:14,995
Apply it on the cut to keep it from drying out

12
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:20,994
and helps prevent orchids from rotting.

13
00:03:20,994 --> 00:03:25,993
WAIT FOR THE GLUE TO DRY

14
00:03:27,993 --> 00:03:35,991
Use 1 teaspoon of cinnamon bark powder

15
00:03:35,991 --> 00:03:42,990
Add 60ml boiled water

16
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:52,988
Wait for the water to cool

17
00:04:23,982 --> 00:04:28,981
Soak the moss in this cinnamon water for about 20 minutes

18
00:04:28,981 --> 00:04:36,979
Cinnamon juice has very good antiseptic properties

19
00:04:57,975 --> 00:05:03,974
After 20 minutes soak in cinnamon water

20
00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:34,968
I use recycled plastic bottles to make orchid care tools

21
00:05:51,998 --> 00:05:57,996
Insert the branch and point the sprout upward

22
00:05:57,996 --> 00:06:03,995
and spray regularly with moisturizing water

23
00:06:14,993 --> 00:06:20,992
PUT IN A COOL LOCATION

24
00:06:20,992 --> 00:06:23,991
and spray water to moisturize

25
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:47,987
AFTER 3 WEEKS

26
00:06:47,987 --> 00:07:06,983
Sprouts have grown

27
00:07:16,981 --> 00:07:20,980
Regularly mist to moisturize

28
00:07:28,978 --> 00:07:33,978
CONTINUE INSTALLATION IN A COOL PLACE

29
00:07:40,976 --> 00:07:48,975
AFTER 3 MONTHS

30
00:07:48,975 --> 00:07:59,972
The small orchid has grown very well

31
00:07:59,972 --> 00:08:19,968
Roots develop very well

32
00:08:40,998 --> 00:08:56,994
Reuse recycled plastic bottles to grow orchids

33
00:09:27,988 --> 00:09:50,984
With this planting method, orchids will grow very quickly

34
00:09:50,984 --> 00:10:05,881
Because orchids always have appropriate humidity
