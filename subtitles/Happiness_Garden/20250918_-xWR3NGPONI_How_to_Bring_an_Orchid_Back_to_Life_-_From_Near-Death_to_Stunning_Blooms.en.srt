7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,559
During the process of growing orchids,

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,320
almost everyone has encountered the

9
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,720
problem of orchids rotting when the

10
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,240
weather turns hot.

11
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,720
This is a common issue that worries

12
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,039
growers because just a slight delay in

13
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,680
treatment can cause the plant to get

14
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,680
damaged very quickly.

15
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,040
If you are new to growing orchids and

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,880
suddenly face the problem of your plant

17
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,559
rotting without knowing how to handle

18
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,480
it, don't worry. This is an issue many

19
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,320
orchid growers have experienced. And

20
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,840
there is definitely a way to save the

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,840
plant if you act in time.

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,559
When encountering this situation, the

23
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,199
first thing you need to do is gently

24
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,120
check the entire root system and cut off

25
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,760
the damaged roots as they can spread

26
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,760
disease to the healthy ones, causing the

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,399
plant to weaken and making recovery

28
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,080
difficult.

sheath and leaves. Uh this will help

39
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,200
prevent fungal diseases from spreading

40
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,600
to the healthy parts of the plant and

41
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,170
create a well ventilated environment for

42
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,420
faster recovery.

51
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,800
After checking the growing medium, if

you see that it is still fresh, loose,

53
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,200
and drains well, there is no need to

54
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,280
replace it yet. This helps the plant

55
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,280
avoid shock after trimming the roots and

56
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,560

After cutting off the damaged roots and

61
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,519
leaves,

62
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,680
wash the entire orchid under running

63
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,080
water to remove any remaining fungi and

64
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,360
bacteria on the roots, keeping the plant

65
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,360
clean and ready for the next step.

66
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,760
After rinsing the orchid under running

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,519
water, place it in a cool, well

68
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,080
ventilated area away from direct

69
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,760
sunlight and wait until it is completely

70
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,680
dry.

71
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,360
To help the orchid recover quickly, I

72
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,560
will use a natural fertilizer that I

73
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,120
make myself. This this fertilizer is

74
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,280
safe and provides all the essential uh

75
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,120
nutrients, helping the roots grow back

76
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,360
quickly and the leaves develop strong

77
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,680
and healthy.

78
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,599
Take three teaspoons of rice and put

79
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,800
them into a clean container to prepare

80
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,720
the fertilizer solution. Um, rice will

81
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,319
provide natural starch and minerals

82
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,959
helping to nourish the roots and

83
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,720
stimulate faster recovery.

84
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,799
The next ingredient I use is coffee

85
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,640
grounds as they contain many minerals

86
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,720
such as nitrogen, potassium, and

87
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,879
phosphorus which help the plant grow

88
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,760
strong, produce roots quickly, and

89
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,760
develop greener leaves.

90
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,760
Next, pour one liter of boiling water

91
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,760
into the container to extract all the

92
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,840
nutrients from the rice and coffee

93
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,160
grounds, creating a nutrient-rich

94
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,360
solution for the plant.

96
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,079
Close the lid tightly and let it ferment

97
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,400
for one day so that the rice and coffee

98
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,079
grounds release all their nutrients,

99
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,639
allowing the solution to ferment

100
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:26,919
slightly and making it easier for the

101
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,919
orchid to absorb when watered.

102
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,919
After the growing medium has completely

103
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,560
dried, we proceed to plant the orchid in

104
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,720
a new pot. This provides a clean and

105
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,280
well ventilated environment, reduces the

106
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,280
risk of fungal diseases and creates

107
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,110
ideal conditions for new roots to grow

108
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,759

110
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,759
I usually choose a pot with plenty of

111
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,080
drainage holes at the bottom so the

112
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:02,479
roots stay dry and avoid water logging.

113
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,080
The growing medium I use is crushed pine

114
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,479
bark, which provides just the right

115
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,320
amount of moisture, drains well, and

116
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:12,440
creates an ideal environment for orchid

117
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,440
roots to grow strong and healthy.

When planting, gently tuck the pine bark

120
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,360
around the roots to secure the plant,

121
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,039
avoiding breaking the young roots.

122
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,280
Packing it just right will help the

123
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,870
plant stand firm, allowing the roots to

124
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,959
anchor to the medium and grow faster.

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,360
still good and the new crushed pine bark

128
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,080
will help maintain stable moisture while

129
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,320
still ensuring proper irration, creating

130
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,320
ideal conditions for new roots to grow

131
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,320
vigorously.

132
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,240
After planting, you should place the

133
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,199
orchid pot in a cool, wellventilated

134
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,440
area for one day and avoid watering.

135
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,479
This step allows the root cuts to dry

136
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,319
completely, reducing the risk of rot and

137
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,319
helping the plant adapt to its new

138
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,370

160
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,360
Uh the first method is to water this

mixture directly onto the roots and

162

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,400
and stem will also receive more

170
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,160
nutrients, becoming lush and sturdy.

171
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,319
This not only helps the plant recover

172
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,919
from rot, but also creates conditions

173
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,160
for the mother plant to produce new

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,399
compared to direct watering is that the

193
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,720
nutrients are evenly distributed over

194
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,040
the leaves, stem, and surface of the

195
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,640
growing medium, allowing the plant to

196
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,519
absorb them more quickly through

197
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,600
multiple parts, not just the roots. At

198
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,839
the same time, spraying lightly retains

199
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,720
moisture in the medium without flooding

200
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,959
the roots, reducing the risk of rot and

201
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,430
creating a well ventilated environment

202
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:29,040
for healthy growth.

[Music]

204
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,760
If the growing medium dries out after

205
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,160
watering, you can you can leave the

206
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,720
orchid pot to soak in this mixture for

207
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,800
about 20 minutes. This method allows the

208
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,440
roots and medium to absorb the nutrients

209
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,959
evenly while providing the necessary

210
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,600
moisture for the plant to recover

211
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,720
quickly without shocking or damaging the

212
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,399
roots. Any

213
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,880
remaining mixture can be used to spray

214
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,120
on other healthy orchids in your garden.

215
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,600
This not not only makes use of the

216
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,760
nutrient-rich solution, but also helps

217
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,120
the other orchids grow greener with

218
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,279
stronger roots and leaves.

219
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,680
After spraying or soaking, simply place

220
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,240
the orchid in a cool, wellventilated

221
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,480
area away from direct sunlight and avoid

222
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,320
watering for a few hours to allow the

223
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,959
nutrients to penetrate deeply into the

224
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,399
roots and leaves. Regularly following

225
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,640
this method will help the plant stay

226
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,860
healthy and ready for the next blooming

227
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,440

229
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,959
After soaking for 20 minutes, gently

230
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,760
remove the orchid pot and check the

231
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,680
leaves.

232
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,839
If there is still water on the leaves,

233
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,760
use a soft cloth to dry them to prevent

234
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,240
fungal growth and ensure the leaves

235
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:50,040
remain dry, creating the best conditions

236
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,040
for the plant to recover.

237
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,200
When wiping the leaves, do so very

238
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,279
gently from the base to the tip to avoid

239
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,519
damaging the leaf tissue. Once the

240
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,600
leaves are completely dry, place the

241
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,680
plant in a cool, wellventilated area

242
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,530
away from direct sunlight and continue

243
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:13,169

You can see that uh many new healthy

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,000
roots have grown and the orchid has even

249
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,600
sprouted two new leaves at the tip. This

250
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,760
shows that the plant has fully

251
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,399
recovered. The roots are developing well

252
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,480

glossier, indicating that the orchid has

258
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,519
not only recovered, but is also

259
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,160

method depending on your conditions and

277
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,399

279
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:01,260

You can see that from an orchid that had

292
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,040
only one leaf and seemed close to dying,

293
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,079
