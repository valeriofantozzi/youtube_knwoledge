00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:03,528 --> 00:00:09,431
Today I will show you how to revive a rotten orchid like this.

3
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:18,937
When the orchid has withered all the leaves, only the stem and roots remain, do not rush to throw it away.

4
00:00:33,837 --> 00:00:40,080
Here are still fresh roots.

5
00:00:41,604 --> 00:00:51,590
First, cut off all damaged, rotten roots.

6
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:12,786
Apply a molten candle on the cut so that the water does not penetrate the tree.

7
00:01:41,642 --> 00:01:50,112
Use 2 teaspoons of cinnamon powder.

8
00:01:56,691 --> 00:02:06,675
Add 1 liter of boiled water.

9
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:26,005
Close the lid and wait for the water to cool.

10
00:02:29,044 --> 00:02:34,037
The water has cooled down

11
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:42,868
Filter out residue.

12
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:18,841
Soak orchids in this water for 30 minutes.

13
00:03:21,871 --> 00:03:39,034
The rest of the water I will spray on other orchids to help protect the orchid from insects and fungal diseases.

14
00:03:51,089 --> 00:03:55,466
After soaking for 30 minutes, plant it.

15
00:03:55,595 --> 00:04:06,927
Using pine bark and dry pumice stone to plant will help absorb moisture in the roots, making the orchid roots not rot.

16
00:04:11,123 --> 00:04:16,351
Add some dry moss on the face.

17
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,834
Put in a cool and well-lit place for 7 days.

18
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:30,000
After 7 days, you can spray water to keep the plants moist.

19
00:04:32,662 --> 00:04:39,211
Cover with a clear, vented plastic container and wait for the plant to revive.

20
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:44,534
AFTER 3 WEEKS,

21
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:49,067
A sprout has sprouted,

22
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:56,078
Spray water once every 5 days to keep the sprouts moist

23
00:05:00,653 --> 00:05:04,825
AFTER 2 MONTHS

24
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:35,548
Hope this sharing content will help you in resurrecting weak orchids to grow again

25
00:05:40,577 --> 00:05:48,565
Now let's explore the second tip to revive dying orchids.

26
00:05:55,321 --> 00:06:05,295
When the orchid has withered all the leaves and only the stem and roots, do not rush to throw it away.

27
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:20,825
Here the branches are still fresh.

28
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:30,656
I will remove all wilted and rotten leaves.

29
00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:10,291
and I removed all the damaged roots.

30
00:07:10,989 --> 00:07:17,334
I keep only the fresh roots that are left over.

31
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:23,841
I cut off the flower stalk so that the orchid can concentrate nutrients for the new sprout to grow.

32
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:32,676
rinse with water.

33
00:07:39,155 --> 00:07:47,734
Apply melted candle solution to the cut to prevent water from seeping into the tree.

34
00:07:49,106 --> 00:07:59,675
Use 3 cloves of garlic and mince.

35
00:08:06,781 --> 00:08:14,067
Soak garlic in 1 liter of water at room temperature.

36
00:08:14,608 --> 00:08:19,014
Incubate for 1 day.

37
00:08:19,262 --> 00:08:22,348
At the same time, spread in a cool place for 1 day.

38
00:08:26,468 --> 00:08:30,199
1 DAY AFTER

39
00:08:31,248 --> 00:08:35,361
filter out residue

40
00:08:37,421 --> 00:08:48,049
Soak orchid branches in garlic water for 20 minutes

41
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:06,826
The rest of the water I will spray on other orchids to help protect the orchid from insects and fungi.

42
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:16,735
At the same time, garlic juice also stimulates the development of roots and flower sprouts very well

43
00:09:21,775 --> 00:09:25,800
20 MINUTES AFTER.

44
00:09:36,857 --> 00:09:41,997
After soaking for 30 minutes, plant.

45
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:52,520
Using pine bark or dry pumice stone to plant will help absorb moisture in the roots, making the orchid roots not rot.

46
00:09:53,057 --> 00:09:57,816
Put in a cool place for 1 week without watering.

47
00:10:00,219 --> 00:10:04,334
1 WEEK LATER

48
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:12,927
From now on, water the orchid to keep it moist.

49
00:10:14,006 --> 00:10:22,315
Then put it in a place with a temperature of 20-25 degrees Celsius and avoid direct sunlight.

50
00:10:22,315 --> 00:10:29,369
Regularly spray moisture to spread life and revive faster.

51
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:36,546
2 WEEKS AFTER

52
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:08,540
Use 3ml of GE Ginger water mixed with 1 liter of water.

53
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:19,000
GE ginger juice is considered an organic fertilizer that helps to stimulate plant growth very well.

54
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:28,553
Water this GE Ginger every 10 days.

55
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:36,099
 Continue to place in a cool place and avoid direct sunlight

56
00:11:39,285 --> 00:11:42,928
1 MONTH LATER

57
00:11:49,135 --> 00:11:59,125
The roots have grown very well, so we fertilize the orchid with organic fertilizer as I have shared to make the orchid grow healthier.

58
00:11:59,474 --> 00:12:03,267
 Hope this sharing content will help you in resurrecting weak orchids to grow again.

59
00:12:04,338 --> 00:12:11,151
Orchid is a tropical plant with very strong vitality.

60
00:12:11,151 --> 00:12:17,558
With an orchid like this, many people probably throw it away because they think it's dead.

61
00:12:17,558 --> 00:12:22,847
When you see this orchid, don't rush to throw it away.

62
00:12:22,847 --> 00:12:28,099
Today I will show you how to revive orchids like this quickly.

63
00:12:30,342 --> 00:12:37,742
First, cut off all damaged roots

64
00:12:41,505 --> 00:12:49,609
Remember to subscribe to the channel so you don't miss any videos

65
00:12:55,171 --> 00:13:02,864
Rinse with water.

66
00:13:08,772 --> 00:13:20,926
Dry the cut.

67
00:13:22,623 --> 00:13:31,720
Drop the molten candle solution on the freshly cut wound.

68
00:13:33,124 --> 00:13:43,123
Will help orchids not lose water and also work against fungal diseases

69
00:13:47,002 --> 00:13:57,102
Use 1 teaspoon of cinnamon powder

70
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:05,858
1 Liter of boiled water.

71
00:14:06,368 --> 00:14:12,124
Close the lid and wait for the water to cool.

72
00:14:14,094 --> 00:14:18,677
Now the water has cooled.

73
00:14:22,326 --> 00:14:29,550
Filter out the residue.

74
00:14:36,314 --> 00:14:41,953
Soak orchids in cinnamon water for 30 minutes.

75
00:14:48,893 --> 00:14:55,148
Water the cinnamon evenly on the top and bottom of the leaves.

76
00:14:55,734 --> 00:15:01,716
Cinnamon has antiseptic properties, so it helps to eliminate fungi and insects that are harmful to orchids very well.

77
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:08,832
Cinnamon also contains many minerals, vitamins and amino acids that are very beneficial for the revival of orchids.

78
00:15:08,832 --> 00:15:15,619
Do this once a month to keep your orchid protected and healthy.

79
00:15:16,746 --> 00:15:20,448
30 minutes after soaking in cinnamon water.

80
00:15:25,285 --> 00:15:33,242
Use dry pine bark to grow orchids.

81
00:15:39,197 --> 00:15:48,179
Spread 1 turn of dry moss on top of the pot.

82
00:15:50,119 --> 00:16:01,510
Leave in a cool place and do not water for 1 week so that the fungus does not grow harmful

83
00:16:07,624 --> 00:16:17,284
1 week later, start watering to keep the orchid moist

84
00:16:18,222 --> 00:16:25,710
Pour water into the dish at the bottom of the pot to create the right humidity for the orchid to revive quickly.

85
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:34,686
Recycling plastic bottles into miniature greenhouses makes it easier for orchids to revive.

86
00:16:37,282 --> 00:16:42,411
1 month later.

87
00:16:56,635 --> 00:17:04,299
Since the tree has grown roots, I use organic fertilizer made from fish waste to fertilize the orchid.

88
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:19,259
The baby orchid is still very small, so I only apply it on the outside edge of the pot to avoid causing the baby orchid to be shocked with feces.

89
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:36,561
Watering and moisturizing once a week.

90
00:17:41,704 --> 00:17:47,284
2 months later.

91
00:18:09,426 --> 00:18:16,884
 You can see that this orchid is heavily attacked by fungi and bacteria.

92
00:18:16,884 --> 00:18:24,610
If not handled promptly, this orchid can die very quickly.

93
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:30,944
First, remove all diseased leaves,

94
00:18:31,355 --> 00:18:38,060
Otherwise, it will spread to the whole tree,

95
00:18:38,705 --> 00:18:45,813
It even spreads to other healthy plants..

96
00:18:52,552 --> 00:19:02,434
Cut off even damaged roots.

97
00:19:03,224 --> 00:19:07,689
Since the orchid has no leaves, I have to cut off the flower bud,.

98
00:19:07,863 --> 00:19:12,886
Prioritize nutrients for small orchids to revive.

99
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:16,505
This is white cement.

100
00:19:16,505 --> 00:19:19,517
Use 1 small spoon,

101
00:19:19,517 --> 00:19:25,210
Add 0.5 liters of water.

102
00:19:27,505 --> 00:19:30,502
Wait 30 minutes.

103
00:19:32,607 --> 00:19:35,601
AFTER 30 MINUTES OF WAIT.

104
00:19:35,898 --> 00:19:40,422
Decant to see the clear water above.

105
00:19:41,867 --> 00:19:47,125
Remove turbid water underneath.

106
00:19:49,129 --> 00:19:59,141
Soak the whole orchid in this water for about 30 minutes..

107
00:20:03,664 --> 00:20:05,664
AFTER WAITING FOR 30 MINUTES BILLION.

108
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:11,462
Hang in a cool place for 1 day.

109
00:20:15,438 --> 00:20:20,960
After hanging for 1 day.

110
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:25,334
This is cinnamon powder.

111
00:20:25,496 --> 00:20:41,377
I put cinnamon powder on all the cuts to disinfect.

112
00:20:50,468 --> 00:21:02,153
Growing orchids with dry pine bark.

113
00:21:17,851 --> 00:21:22,432
Leave in a cool place for 1 week without watering.

114
00:21:24,334 --> 00:21:29,023
After 1 week without watering.

115
00:21:29,023 --> 00:21:33,050
The cut is dry.

116
00:21:34,308 --> 00:21:40,974
Use 1 liter of water.

117
00:21:42,336 --> 00:21:50,440
Add 20 grams of aloe leaves.

118
00:22:25,034 --> 00:22:33,079
Watering freshly made aloe vera for orchids..

119
00:22:35,415 --> 00:22:48,234
Aloe vera juice contains many essential minerals and vitamins that help stimulate root growth,

120
00:23:18,412 --> 00:23:30,155
It also stimulates germination.

121
00:23:33,823 --> 00:23:41,370
Leave in a cool place and wait.

122
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,000
AFTER 3 WEEKS.

123
00:23:52,817 --> 00:24:00,540
new sprouts.

124
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:43,488
From now on, water once every 5-7 days to keep moisture.

125
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:52,841
AFTER THE NEXT 2 MONTHS.

126
00:24:57,237 --> 00:25:04,285
Orchid has revived and grown healthy.

127
00:25:08,714 --> 00:25:20,310
From now on, apply organic fertilizer every 2 weeks as I shared to help the orchid grow and produce many flowers

128
00:25:31,194 --> 00:25:38,329
 Now comes the 5th tip to quickly revive a rotten orchid like this.

129
00:25:48,337 --> 00:25:54,856
All the leaves are rotten.

130
00:25:55,109 --> 00:25:57,109
This flower has also dried.

131
00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:13,230
The top of the flower is still fresh so I decided to leave it to propagate from this flower.

132
00:26:13,792 --> 00:26:23,892
Next, cut off all the damaged roots.

133
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:37,257
Although the orchid has rotted, there are still some fresh roots.

134
00:26:37,854 --> 00:26:43,112
Rinse with plain water.

135
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:47,701
take 1 aloe leaf

136
00:26:47,978 --> 00:26:53,617
add 2 cloves of germinated garlic,

137
00:26:53,934 --> 00:26:59,456
If you don't have germinated garlic, you can substitute it with regular garlic,

138
00:27:00,511 --> 00:27:06,356
Garlic sprouts contain very rich AUXIN content.

139
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:18,509
so it will help the orchid respawn very quickly

140
00:27:20,107 --> 00:27:23,340
add about 30g of aloe leaves

141
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:27,709
add 1 liter of water

142
00:27:27,931 --> 00:27:33,100
puree

143
00:27:34,807 --> 00:27:41,532
filter out residue

144
00:27:44,989 --> 00:27:50,863
Soak orchids in this water for 20 minutes

145
00:27:54,604 --> 00:28:01,476
I recycle plastic bottles as tools to revive orchids

146
00:28:03,691 --> 00:28:08,626
This recycling tool will also contribute to creating a favorable environment for the orchid to revive quickly,

147
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:21,565
It also helps to reduce environmental pollution.

148
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:30,000
wash

149
00:28:45,899 --> 00:28:54,385
make vents

150
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:41,770
Use dry pine bark

151
00:29:48,675 --> 00:29:55,018
let dry for 1 week without watering.

152
00:29:55,612 --> 00:30:02,073
The dry pine bark will absorb moisture to help protect the orchid from further rot

153
00:30:05,865 --> 00:30:07,865
AFTER 1 WEEK

154
00:30:12,518 --> 00:30:26,169
Now start watering to keep the orchid moist

155
00:30:32,689 --> 00:30:38,334
Every 5 days, spray mist to keep the orchid moist

156
00:30:39,996 --> 00:30:45,635
and put in a cool place to spread recovery

157
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:57,665
AFTER 3 WEEKS

158
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:17,528
Sprout has revived

159
00:31:18,022 --> 00:31:27,946
and the roots are also revived

160
00:31:39,102 --> 00:31:43,098
Continue periodically for 5 days misting to keep the orchid moist.

161
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:46,690
Continue to keep in a cool place for the spread to recover

162
00:31:50,991 --> 00:31:52,991
AFTER 2 MONTHS

163
00:31:58,453 --> 00:32:07,731
Lan has revived and grown healthy

164
00:32:09,224 --> 00:32:17,152
Steam from below always evaporates, creating the right moisture for orchids to revive and grow.

165
00:32:20,762 --> 00:32:29,218
Hopefully the above tips for growing orchids will help you take better care of orchids at home.
