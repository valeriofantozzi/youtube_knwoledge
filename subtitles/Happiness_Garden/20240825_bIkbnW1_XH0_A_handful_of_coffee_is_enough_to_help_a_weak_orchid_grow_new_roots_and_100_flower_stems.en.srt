Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:43,725
When the orchid has finished blooming or the plant is stunted, slow to grow and has not yet bloomed

3
00:00:48,111 --> 00:00:56,089
Cut all dry branches, roots and leaves

4
00:01:23,676 --> 00:01:33,882
then take 3 teaspoons

5
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:48,112
Add 2 liters of boiled water

6
00:01:58,771 --> 00:02:06,742
then brew until the water cools

7
00:02:12,537 --> 00:02:22,506
After the water cools, filter to remove residue

8
00:02:46,355 --> 00:02:56,366
Then add water to get 5 liters of liquid organic fertilizer solution from coffee

9
00:03:08,692 --> 00:03:18,661
First, use this water to thoroughly wipe the top and bottom of the leaves.

10
00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:35,325
This clears dirt and removes fungus, disease and insects that damage the leaves.

11
00:03:38,589 --> 00:03:46,556
Apply this method once a month

12
00:03:53,484 --> 00:04:00,472
Helps leaves stay green, strong and resistant to pests

13
00:04:08,802 --> 00:04:16,783
Then you use this water to water the orchid roots

14
00:04:19,251 --> 00:04:28,247
This helps roots grow healthily and prevents root rot

15
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:46,344
Coffee contains many minerals necessary for the growth of orchids

16
00:04:52,189 --> 00:05:02,174
Organic phosphorus and potassium found in coffee help roots and flowers develop outstandingly

17
00:05:05,429 --> 00:05:15,426
Do this twice a month for your orchids so they grow and bloom profusely

18
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:42,599
Or you can also use this water to spray the entire orchid

19
00:05:58,477 --> 00:06:08,461
Thoroughly spray the top and bottom of the leaves to remove dirt and insects from the leaf surface

20
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:19,659
Do this every 2 weeks.

21
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:35,755
Coffee water helps repel orchid pests very effectively

22
00:06:43,973 --> 00:06:52,952
After spraying and soaking in this water for about 5 minutes, the insects will run away from the orchid pot.

23
00:07:13,095 --> 00:07:21,080
Then take the orchid pot out and place it in a cool place with enough light for the orchid to grow

24
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:26,945
2 Months later

25
00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:36,843
Orchids will begin to sprout and bloom profusely

26
00:07:44,295 --> 00:07:52,274
Blooming flowers have bright colors

27
00:07:55,529 --> 00:08:02,505
Shoe petals will stay fresh longer

28
00:08:03,505 --> 00:08:12,770
The flowers bloom for up to 6 months before fading

29
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:26,900
