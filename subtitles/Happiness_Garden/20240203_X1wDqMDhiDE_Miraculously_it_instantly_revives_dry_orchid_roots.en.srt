Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:03,866 --> 00:00:11,898
 
This video is a useful source of information for beginners growing orchids

3
00:00:12,498 --> 00:00:20,896
or having difficulty getting the orchid to bloom.

4
00:00:21,196 --> 00:00:29,895
The curriculum provides the basics of how to care for orchids, including:

5
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:35,893
Light, temperature, humidity and fertilizer help orchids bloom year-round.

6
00:00:35,893 --> 00:00:42,065
If you are interested in taking care of orchids, watch the video to learn more knowledge and skills.

7
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:46,891
1. Light

8
00:00:48,914 --> 00:00:56,889
 
Orchids need enough light to grow.

9
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:10,886
Make sure they get enough sunlight or good artificial light.

10
00:01:13,446 --> 00:01:23,884
You can place the orchid pot on the windowsill or under a specialized sun filter for orchids.

11
00:01:25,883 --> 00:01:33,882
If left in direct sunlight, orchids can easily die.

12
00:01:38,093 --> 00:01:41,880
2. Water and humidity.

13
00:01:43,735 --> 00:01:50,879
Water appropriately.

14
00:01:55,273 --> 00:02:05,876
Orchids usually need steady humidity, but don't keep the soil wet all the time.

15
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:20,873
Every month you water and soak the orchid pot in water once.

16
00:02:20,873 --> 00:02:30,871
This helps retain moisture and wash away excess humus and fertilizer in the orchid growing medium.

17
00:02:36,106 --> 00:02:47,949
On weekdays, when you see the substrate is dry, spray mist to keep the orchid pot moist.

18
00:02:50,532 --> 00:03:00,530
Soak in water for about 20 minutes until the roots turn green, then take them out.

19
00:03:09,304 --> 00:03:26,893
Then take out the orchid pot.

20
00:03:37,891 --> 00:03:42,890
3. When orchids rot

21
00:03:44,101 --> 00:03:54,887
Orchids grown in industrial gardens when first purchased are very susceptible to rot.

22
00:03:59,753 --> 00:04:09,884
This orchid pot grows a lot of mold in the growing environment.

23
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:22,882
If not treated promptly, the entire tree can easily rot.

24
00:04:28,881 --> 00:04:36,879
Take 2 liters of water.

25
00:04:41,772 --> 00:04:50,876
Then add 1 spoon of wood ash.

26
00:04:50,876 --> 00:05:01,874
Wood ash helps kill fungi and adds nutrients to help increase plant resistance

27
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:15,871
Filter to get clear water.

28
00:05:31,868 --> 00:05:41,899
Then soak the orchid pot in this clear water for 10 minutes.

29
00:05:46,556 --> 00:05:56,896
Wood ash helps balance the PH level in the orchid growing medium.

30
00:05:58,896 --> 00:06:08,894
and stimulates root growth.

31
00:06:17,065 --> 00:06:23,334
After soaking for 10 minutes, take it out.

32
00:06:24,465 --> 00:06:33,889
The mold on the orchid growing medium has disappeared.

33
00:06:38,888 --> 00:06:48,886
Leave for 10 days without watering to let the orchid recover on its own.

34
00:06:53,885 --> 00:06:58,884
10 Days Later

35
00:07:06,016 --> 00:07:16,881
The roots have recovered and grown new roots.

36
00:07:39,537 --> 00:07:49,874
The leaves are green again.

37
00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:04,871
Flower buds grow larger and do not fall off when young.

38
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:16,869
From now on, start watering so the orchid continues to grow.

39
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:37,131
Then plant them in pots or put them on a plate like I did.

40
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:50,895
Hopefully the video will help you take better care of orchids at home.

41
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:58,894
Thank you for watching the video. Good luck and see you in the next videos.
