day so that you have more choices in caring 
for orchids at home using natural methods

and flower branches new Roots grow many and

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:32,640
fat today I will introduce to you 
a simple and extremely effective  

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,200
organic fertilizer helps orchids 
absorb maximum nutrients and grow

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:47,800
quickly let's get started when an 
orchid lacks nutrients especially  

7
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,720
potassium its flower buds will 
easily Wilt and fall off while  

8
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:59,920
the blooms will fade quickly with petals 
becoming weak and dropping soon after

9
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,200
therefore we can create our own 
fertilizer to improve this condition  

10
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:29,920
allowing the Orchid to grow healthily 
bloom regly and remain more vibrant

11
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,560
to make this type of fertilizer I use

12
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,120
coffee put two teaspoons in the

13
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:59,840
pot add 0.5 liters of boiling water

14
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,000
and this is eggshell powder a wonderful 
lateral ingredient that provides calcium  

15
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,840
to orchids promoting healthier 
growth and better development

16
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,680
just add one teaspoon of eggshell powder which is  

17
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,840
which is enough to provide the 
essential nutrients for your

18
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:47,200

hours pour 500 ml of warm water into the cup

20
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,520
this is bread

21
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:29,760
yeast put one spoon of yeast into the cup

22
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,040
stir well so that the yeast 
is completely dissolved in the

23
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:48,360
solution leave it for 2 hours to allow the 
beneficial microorganisms in the yeast to

24
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:54,560
develop after 2

25
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:01,960
hours you take the coffee 
solution then filter out the

wiping the leaves with a mixture 
of coffee and eggshells helps clean  

32
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,080
off dust provide direct nutrients to 
the leaves and enhance photosynthesis  

33
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:29,640
keeping the plant healthy 
and promoting better growth

34
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,160
um the mixture of coffee and eggshells 
also creates a natural protective layer  

35
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:59,640
on the leaf surface reducing the risk 
of pest infestations and fungal diseases

leaves and stems especially in 
dry environments promoting better

45
00:07:43,600 --> 00:08:00,720
growth additionally it aids the plant in absorbing 
nutrients more effectively accelerating the growth

46
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:17,200
process however you should not spray 
this mixture on the flower petals  

47
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:29,440

causing the Buds and Flowers to drop prematurely

50
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,680
next we mix the yeast solution with the coffee and  

51
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,160
eggshell mixture to create a 
fertilizer solution for the

52
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:29,360
roots uh step three water 
the roots with this mixture

53
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,800
watering the roots with this mixture 
provides essential nutrients promotes  

54

root growth and helps the Orchid 
absorb water and nutrients more

55
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:59,320
effectively additionally this 
mixture helps improve the soil's pH  

56
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
creating an ideal environment for the plant's

57
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:16,200
growth this mixture also stimulates 
the growth of new Roots enhancing  

58
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,960
the plant's ability to withstand 
harsh environmental conditions  

59
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:29,320
it also AIDS in the recovery of 
the plant after illness or damage

60
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,320
it also enhances the plant's 
ability to absorb minerals  

61
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,120
and Trace elements promoting 
Healthy Growth and consistent

62
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:54,480
blooming it also helps maintain soil 
moisture preventing drought conditions  

63
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,240
and ensuring the plant has enough water to thrive

64
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,360
step four use a cloth to soak up any water 
droplets on the leaves especially in the leaf

65
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:21,960
axles uh soaking up the water droplets 
on the leaves helps prevent the growth  

66
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:27,280
of mold and bacteria protecting the 
leaves from rot or damage it also  

67
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,400
helps the leaves dry faster reducing 
the risk of infection due to prolonged

68
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:51,840
moisture additionally soaking up 
the water on the leaves helps the  

69
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:59,240
plant maintain a clean appearance 
preventing water stains from forming

70
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,320
this also allows the plant to absorb light 
more efficiently supporting the photosynthesis

71
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:24,880
process care for your Orchids with the four steps  

72
