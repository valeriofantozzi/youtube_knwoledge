Welcome to my channel

2
00:00:38,777 --> 00:00:45,758
When the orchids have finished blooming

3
00:00:45,758 --> 00:00:55,756
Cut off all wilted flower stems

4
00:01:02,755 --> 00:01:12,553
and remove diseased leaves

5
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:28,833
This helps remove pathogens from the orchid.

6
00:01:41,738 --> 00:01:51,714
This is a cement with very good antiseptic properties

7
00:01:54,082 --> 00:02:04,076
Apply it to the cut to help it heal quickly

8
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:35,870
Then place it in a cool place for 1 day without watering to let the cut dry on its own

9
00:02:40,312 --> 00:02:50,333
And here are soybeans, very rich in nutrients for the growth of orchids

10
00:02:53,903 --> 00:03:03,897
Take a handful of soybeans and soak them in 2 liters of boiled water

11
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:30,725
Incubate until the water cools

12
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:48,189
After the water cools, add 3 tablespoons of sugar

13
00:04:05,135 --> 00:04:12,117
Then add 20ml of vinegar

14
00:04:12,117 --> 00:04:20,616
Vinegar and sugar help ferment soybeans quickly

15
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:32,413
Then leave in a cool place for 5 days to ferment

16
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:50,043
5 days later filter this water

17
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:13,538
After fermenting these soybeans, we can fertilize the base of the rose tree and it will be very good

18
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:23,870
Add 2 liters of water

19
00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:46,032
Now water each orchid pot with this liquid fertilizer every 2 weeks

20
00:05:51,386 --> 00:06:01,362
Fermented soybeans will also provide very good nutrition for orchids to grow

21
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:18,426
This fermented fertilizer also helps protect roots from fungal diseases that harm orchids very effectively

22
00:06:26,224 --> 00:06:36,222
Soak the orchid pot in this fertilizer solution for about 10 minutes and then take it out

23
00:07:18,202 --> 00:07:28,178
Then we spray this liquid fertilizer on the orchid leaves every 2 weeks

24
00:07:33,232 --> 00:07:43,209
Helps supplement nutrients through leaves and effectively eliminate fungal diseases and insects on leaves

25
00:07:55,216 --> 00:08:05,204
This also helps keep the leaf surface clean, leading to better photosynthesis

26
00:08:13,036 --> 00:08:20,035
Continue to place in a cool, well-lit place to care for orchids

27
00:08:27,732 --> 00:08:30,899
After 2 months

28
00:08:35,898 --> 00:08:46,896
Many baby orchids have been revived from old roots

29
00:09:19,062 --> 00:09:29,054
This type of liquid fertilizer helps stimulate orchid growth very effectively

30
00:10:07,996 --> 00:10:18,978
Continue to water the roots with liquid fertilizer and spray the leaves every 2 weeks

31
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:10,868
After the next 1 month

32
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:38,529
After the next 2 weeks

33
00:11:55,210 --> 00:12:00,891
The flowers bloom very fragrant

34
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,889
The flower color is vibrant and long-lasting

35
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:16,888
The flowers stick on the branches for a long time before falling

36
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:28,886
Hopefully the video will help you a lot in taking better care of orchids at home

37
00:12:29,885 --> 00:12:36,884
