00:00:16,629 --> 00:00:21,479
Welcome to my channel

2
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:25,400
There are different ways to propagate orchids

3
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,991
For you to have more options in orchid breeding.

4
00:00:28,991 --> 00:00:33,472
Today I share how to make a new guide to propagate orchids from ginger root.

5
00:00:33,472 --> 00:00:38,695
It will be very simple but extremely effective.

6
00:00:38,695 --> 00:00:45,688
Please watch to the end of the video to understand my comments.

7
00:00:45,688 --> 00:00:53,468
First peel off this film so that small orchids can grow easily.

8
00:01:04,312 --> 00:01:09,117
Use 10g of fresh ginger

9
00:01:12,102 --> 00:01:16,052
Add 300ml of water

10
00:01:16,052 --> 00:01:20,923
Ginger is a very good plant growth stimulant.

11
00:01:20,923 --> 00:01:28,277
At the same time, ginger also has antiseptic properties that will help eliminate fungus for orchids.

12
00:01:28,277 --> 00:01:36,265
Ginger prevents rot disease on orchids very well.

13
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:54,383
Soak orchid branches in ginger water for 10 minutes.

14
00:02:03,818 --> 00:02:11,360
Use 1 teaspoon of turmeric powder

15
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:17,473
Add 600ml of water

16
00:02:24,807 --> 00:02:31,830
Turmeric contains many minerals such as magnesium, calcium, zinc, protein, phosphorus, and natural potassium,

17
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:36,642
very good for the growth of orchids

18
00:02:36,642 --> 00:02:42,324
And turmeric also has very high antibacterial properties

19
00:02:44,815 --> 00:02:54,597
take it out and wait for it to dry

20
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:07,839
Mix ginger juice with turmeric water

21
00:03:10,011 --> 00:03:14,320
Soak moss in this water for 20 minutes,

22
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:25,970
Helps kill mold and bacteria in orchid growing media.

23
00:03:38,662 --> 00:03:45,520
Spread a molten candle on the top of the cut so that the orchid does not lose water,

24
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:52,959
Doing so does not allow water to penetrate inside the orchid,

25
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:59,163
will protect orchids from rot.

26
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:24,535
I reuse plastic boxes to make orchid propagation tools.

27
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:33,131
I made many drainage holes here

28
00:04:39,428 --> 00:04:48,612
and this is the vent that helps to circulate the air inside with the outside of the box.

29
00:05:00,222 --> 00:05:02,222
Put the orchid branch in, pay attention to the sprouts facing up,

30
00:05:02,222 --> 00:05:07,867
Then spray moisturizing mist every 5 days.

31
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:18,171
Place in a cool place

32
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:29,045
AFTER 2 MONTHS

33
00:05:32,491 --> 00:05:42,889
From a small sprout that has grown into a seedling.

34
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:52,744
Roots grow healthy,

35
00:05:52,744 --> 00:06:05,956
but the orchid is small and weak,

36
00:06:05,956 --> 00:06:19,879
so I continue to grow orchids in this mini greenhouse for a while longer.

37
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:28,647
Continue misting to moisturize every 5 days

38
00:06:32,145 --> 00:06:35,906
Continue to keep in a cool place

39
00:06:42,425 --> 00:06:45,981
AFTER THE NEXT 20 DAYS.

40
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:54,321
Orchid is bigger and healthier

41
00:07:00,584 --> 00:07:06,621
The roots are also much healthier

42
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:16,448
In order for the orchid to not rot later, I will plant it with a more ventilated medium

43
00:07:21,685 --> 00:07:28,526
I grow with a medium that includes: pine bark, pumice and terracotta.

44
00:07:28,526 --> 00:07:33,570
This medium will help the orchid's roots to always be ventilated and ha,ve the right humidity for the orchid

45
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,529
help orchids not root rot.

46
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:43,142
Add some moss on your face for better moisturizing.

47
00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:52,874
Now take care of it like any other orchid

48
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:58,673
Apply organic fertilizer once every 2 weeks for good growth.

49
00:08:00,872 --> 00:08:03,871
I'm so glad you came to my channel

50
00:08:03,871 --> 00:08:11,870
If you have an orchid, make sure you want it to bloom for a long time.

51
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:20,868
Orchids are known for their ability to keep flowers on their branches for 3 to 6 months.

52
00:08:25,867 --> 00:08:36,898
For that to happen, you need to nurture, water, and feed it well.

53
00:08:36,898 --> 00:08:46,896
Now I will show you what is the best fertilizer for orchids.

54
00:08:46,896 --> 00:08:56,894
If you follow us till the end of this video, you will learn how to make orchids bloom like crazy.

55
00:09:01,893 --> 00:09:05,893
Now let's get started

56
00:09:07,892 --> 00:09:17,890
Take a bowl and put 5 tablespoons of rice in it.

57
00:09:28,888 --> 00:09:35,887
Pour in 500ml of water at room temperature.

58
00:09:36,886 --> 00:09:46,884
Mix the rice well and wash the rice before cooking.

59
00:09:51,883 --> 00:10:01,881
Then filter the water to wash the rice.

60
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:15,879
Use a cotton ball soaked in water to wash this rice

61
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:25,877
Then wipe on the top and bottom of the leaves

62
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:40,874
Will help clean the surface of the leaves

63
00:10:45,873 --> 00:10:52,871
remove disease fungi and insects on orchids

64
00:10:56,871 --> 00:11:06,869
At the same time, it provides the necessary nutrients for the orchid's growth

65
00:11:10,868 --> 00:11:18,900
Repeat after 2 weeks will help the orchid stay green

66
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:36,896
Or you can also pour the rice water into a spray bottle.

67
00:11:46,894 --> 00:11:56,892
Then spray evenly on the top and bottom of the leaves

68
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:08,890
This method also has the same effect as the previous method using cotton balls

69
00:12:20,887 --> 00:12:28,886
Note Do not spray rice water on flowers

70
00:12:30,885 --> 00:12:39,884
Now take a deep bowl in which you will place the orchid ready for watering and soaking.

71
00:12:41,883 --> 00:12:50,881
Rice water is a great natural fertilizer for orchids, as it encourages the flowering of this beautiful plant.

72
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:06,878
You can soak the orchid in this rice water for about 1 hour so that the orchid roots can absorb the most nutrients.

73
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:25,874
Then, remove and repeat this treatment every 14 days.

74
00:13:32,873 --> 00:13:40,872
You can also freeze rice water to water your orchids.

75
00:13:59,868 --> 00:14:09,899
When needed, you just need to take a few dice.

76
00:14:18,897 --> 00:14:28,895
Wait for them to defrost and reach room temperature, you can feed your orchids again.

77
00:14:37,894 --> 00:14:46,892
Never place frozen blocks directly on the base of the orchid

78
00:14:48,891 --> 00:14:56,890
Because orchids don't like the cold.

79
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:06,888
After only 2-3 weeks of use, the leaves will be green

80
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:22,885
New roots will grow

81
00:15:24,884 --> 00:15:34,882
 
This will help the orchid best absorb nutrients through the roots

82
00:15:43,881 --> 00:15:53,879
With enough nutrition, your orchid will flower all year round

83
00:15:53,879 --> 00:16:00,877
And that will be all we have prepared for you for this video.
