Welcome to my

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,590
channel. When you buy an orchid or

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:21,880
someone gives it to

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:27,080

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,080
you. Um, you need to do the following.

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,999
[Music]

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,399
Leave the orchid in a cool place for a

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,399
few hours to let it adapt to the new

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,280
climate. If you haven't subscribed to

the channel yet, uh please support me by

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,360
pressing the subscribe button and

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,640
ringing the bell to stay updated and not

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,640
miss any orchid growing tips.

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,120
If the growing medium is moss or small

15
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,140
wood chips, it is only suitable for

16
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,290
industrial orchid

[Music]

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,520
gardens. Because moss retains a lot of

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,850
moisture, many plant roots rot due to

20
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,620

25
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,079
It's great that we can chat together

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,079
from all over the

27
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,799
world. The humidity was too high, so the

28
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,799
leaves were also infected with black

29
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,799
mold.

[Music]

31
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,350
Uh therefore you need to remove all moss

32
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:18,970
or old growing medium.

33
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:18,970
[Music]

34
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,080
Because this type of substrate is only

35
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,060
suitable for industrial orchid gardens

36
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:53,760

38
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,159
Then you cut off all damaged

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,239

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,959

57
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,820

61
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,240
Put all the aloe vera and garlic in a

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:48,160
stimulate root growth and effectively

74
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:53,420
fight harmful insects and fungi.

77
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,800
Spraying this solution on the entire

79
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,770
eliminate fungal diseases, and keep the

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,840
Then clean the black mold stains with

86
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,039

89
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,920
Now I recycle used plastic containers to

90
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,920
make orchid pots.

92
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,090
I put a layer of pummus on the bottom of

97
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,580
orchid pot clear so the roots don't get

98
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:02,880

[Music]

180
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,519
Uh to know if it's time to water

181
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,519
orchids, I look at the color of the

182
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,560
roots. When the orchid roots have a

183
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,800
light silver color, it's time to water

184
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,800
the orchid.

185
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,120
If the roots are bright green, you

186
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,410
should wait until the roots turn pale

187
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,620
silver before

189
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,320
watering. If you water when the roots

190
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:57,240
are still green, the roots will easily

191
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,240
become water logged and cause root rot.

Spray the entire orchid from leaves to

217
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:31,320

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,760
nutrient that helps orchids develop

389
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,710
healthy green growth and enhances their

390
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:01,859
ability to photosynthesize.
