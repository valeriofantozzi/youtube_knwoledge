Welcome to my Happiness Garden channel.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,898
In this video, I share how to fertilize to help weak orchids produce many flowers.

3
00:00:11,898 --> 00:00:22,896
To make this fertilizer you need to take 5 teaspoons of rice

4
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:38,426
Rice contains many nutrients that are important for the growth of orchids

5
00:00:42,892 --> 00:00:50,890
then add 1 liter of warm water

6
00:01:10,113 --> 00:01:20,085
Then add 1 teaspoon of dry yeast (yeast used to make bread)

7
00:01:28,895 --> 00:01:38,881
Yeast helps prevent organic matter from decomposing and rotting

8
00:01:45,595 --> 00:01:55,578
When eating bananas, don't throw away the peel

9
00:01:56,877 --> 00:02:06,875
Adding 1 banana peel helps ferment quickly and enhances nutrition very well

10
00:02:15,074 --> 00:02:22,872
Leave in a cool place to ferment naturally for 3 days

11
00:02:26,134 --> 00:02:33,915
When the last flowers have withered.

12
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:43,544
 
Cut off all flower stalks that have bloomed.

13
00:02:44,853 --> 00:02:52,464
Let me share with you how to revive from flower stalks.

14
00:03:00,361 --> 00:03:11,373
then you peel off the protective film so that this button can easily grow new buds.

15
00:03:30,282 --> 00:03:39,593
Apply toothpaste on the cut,

16
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:51,719
It will help the cut heal.

17
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:13,381
3 days after fermentation, filter this water

18
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:36,879
Add 3 liters of water

19
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:52,490
Then clamp in place where the buttons are likely to grow into sprouts.

20
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:03,862
This fermented juice is packed with nutrients like potassium, nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium and magnesium.

21
00:05:05,493 --> 00:05:14,550
It helps stimulate the growth and development of plants.

22
00:05:16,162 --> 00:05:24,623
Repeat once a week with this fermented water.

23
00:05:24,623 --> 00:05:32,107
On normal days, you just need to spray water to keep it moist.

24
00:05:34,531 --> 00:05:44,183
Then, you use the fermented water to water the orchid roots.

25
00:05:46,314 --> 00:05:56,497
The potassium content in this fermented water helps strengthen and support the growth of branches and roots very well.

26
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:07,339
and nitrogen supports the process of nitrogen formation and the development of reproductive organs of the plant.

27
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:20,466
Apply this liquid fertilizer every 2 weeks to help the plant take root.

28
00:06:22,135 --> 00:06:32,467
Soaking this fermented water for about 30 minutes at a time will be very delicious.

29
00:06:32,467 --> 00:06:39,813
Helps increase the pest resistance of orchids

30
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:53,401
For leaves: you also use this fermented water to spray on the entire plant.

31
00:06:53,401 --> 00:07:00,001
Apply 1-2 times per month.

32
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:04,096
1 MONTH LATER.

33
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:17,839
There are many shoots growing from the nodes.

34
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:32,093
The sprouts that sprout and take root immediately.

35
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:51,141
With this flower stalk, both young shoots and flower buds develop.

36
00:08:15,512 --> 00:08:25,339
And this flower stalk has revived very large flower buds.

37
00:08:26,983 --> 00:08:35,445
This flower branch is smeared with fermented banana juice,

38
00:08:35,445 --> 00:08:42,414
the flower stays fresh for a long time.

39
00:08:55,822 --> 00:09:05,304
This water helps improve soil structure and increase the plant's ability to absorb nutrients.

40
00:09:06,092 --> 00:09:14,128
thereby helping plants grow healthier,

41
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:24,076
Roots will absorb maximum nutrients from the soil.

42
00:09:39,886 --> 00:09:43,885
Hope the video helps you a lot.

43
00:09:43,885 --> 00:09:50,884
