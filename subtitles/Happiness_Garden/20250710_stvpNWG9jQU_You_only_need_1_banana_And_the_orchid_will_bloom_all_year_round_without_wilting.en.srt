Welcome to the happiness garden where we

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,200
Today I want to share with you a gentle

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,120
method making natural fertilizer by hand

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,039
combined with simple care so that your

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,439
orchid can bloom continuously throughout

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,400
all four seasons while staying healthy

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,400
and never becoming exhausted.

[Music]

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,320
Um, you can see that this orchid of mine

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,320
has produced many blooms on a single

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,160
spike. And what's special is that

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,559
multiple flower spikes have grown from

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,960
the same plant, creating a vibrant and

17
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,960
lively beauty.

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,239
However, when the orchid channels all

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,960
its nutrients to support the vibrant

20
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,800
blooms and keep them fresh on the spike,

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,399
that's also the moment when it faces a

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,770
problem, one that I'm about to share

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,559
with you right now.

24
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,800
[Music]

25
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,800
Here's the thing. You might notice that

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,199
even though the flowers are still fresh

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,879
and beautiful, the leaves have started

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,879
to soften and become weak. Right?

29
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,799
If we don't know how to care for and

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,960
restore the plant at the right time, not

31
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,720
only will the leaves wither, but the

32
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,640
orchid's roots will also gradually

33
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,640
weaken, causing the plant to lose

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,400
strength after each blooming cycle.

35
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,320
If your orchid is experiencing the same

36
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,320
condition, don't worry because there's

37
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,360
still a simple way to help it recover

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,360
and continue growing strong.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,520
First, you need to gently remove the

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,799
wilted flowers so that the plant doesn't

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,799
waste nutrients on the faded blooms.

42
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,000
This helps the plant focus on nourishing

43
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,840
its roots, leaves, and the remaining

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,960
fresh blooms on the spike so they can

45
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,719
stay vibrant for longer.

46
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,280
If there are damaged roots or leaves,

47
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,439
you should trim them off immediately.

48
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,200
Removing weakened or rotten parts helps

49
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,280
prevent the spread of disease and allows

50
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,280
the plant to focus all its energy on

51
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,520
recovery and growth.

52
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,280
Bananas are rich in natural potassium,

53
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,840
an essential element that effectively

54
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,599
helps wilted orchids recover and plays a

55
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,200
vital role in the formation and

56
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,440
maintenance of blooms.

57
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,120
Before using bananas as fertilizer, we

58
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,360
need to wash them thoroughly to remove

59
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,000
any chemicals and preservatives that may

60
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,000
remain on the peel.

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,879
from the risk of toxicity or damage, but

64
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,519
also makes the composting process more

65
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,519

Um, to make the fertilizer, simply chop

98
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,560
the banana peel into small pieces.

99
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,239
Cutting it up helps the peel decompose

100
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,280
faster and release nutrients more

101
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,280
effectively for the plant to absorb.

110
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,160
Place the chopped banana peel into a

111
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,000
clean glass bottle. Using a glass bottle

112
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,720
ensures a safe composting process

113
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,639
without reacting with plastic while also

114
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,960
making it easier to observe and clean

115
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,960
after use.

116
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,919
Next, pour about 500 ml of warm water

117
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,680
into the bottle. The warm temperature

118
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,160
will stimulate fermentation, helping the

119
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,400
banana peel break down faster and

120
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,680
release nutrients more effectively for

121
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,680
the plant to absorb more easily.

122
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,919
The next ingredient you need to add is

123
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,400
molasses. It's a natural source of sugar

124
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,960
that promotes fermentation, nourishes

125
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:49,240
beneficial microorganisms, and enhances

126
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,240
the breakdown of the banana peel.

127
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,400
Just add about one teaspoon of molasses.

128
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,320
This small amount is enough to activate

129
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,960
the fermentation process and create a

130
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,520
favorable environment for microorganisms

131
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,520

132
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,479
The final ingredient you need to prepare

133
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,520
is flour. Flour provides starch, an

134
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,520
excellent energy source for

135
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,400
microorganisms, helping the fermentation

136
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,400

blend together.

142
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,039
Finally, seal the bottle and place it in

143
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,800
a cool, wellventilated area away from

144
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,560

during fermentation.

152
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,319
This helps prevent pressure buildup and

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,480
Clean leaves allow light to pass through

192
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,000
more effectively, improving

193
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,080
photosynthesis.

194
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,440
Regularly wiping the leaves removes dust

195
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,279
from the surface, helping the plant

196
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,279
generate energy to grow strong and

197
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,279
healthy.

198
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,160
The fermented banana peel fertilizer

199
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,240
contains beneficial microorganisms that

200
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,480
help inhibit the growth of harmful fungi

201
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,920
and bacteria.

202
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,760
Wiping the leaves with this solution

203
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,920
creates a natural protective layer for

204
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,920
the plant.

205
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,800
[Music]

206
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,800
Orchid leaves after being wiped with the

207
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,279
fertilizer solution will become shinier

208
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,360
and more vibrant. This is also a great

209
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,959
way to make your plant look healthier

210
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,959
and more radiant in your living space.

211
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,240
You only need to wipe the leaves with

212
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:59,440
this fertilizer solution about one to

213
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,320
two times a month. This gentle frequency

214
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,399
is enough to provide regular nutrients,

215
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,920
keep the leaves clean and healthy, and

216
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,920
support the plant's sustainable growth.

217
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,640
Step two, pour a portion of the diluted

218
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,120
fertilizer solution into a clean spray

219
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,120
bottle. Using a spray bottle allows you

220
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,600
to distribute the solution more evenly

221
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,360
over the entire plant, especially around

222
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,000
the roots and growing medium without

223
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,000
causing water logging.

224
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,320
Next, gently spray the solution onto the

225
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,480
upper and lower surfaces of the leaves,

226
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,200
the stem, roots, and even the growing

227
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,360
medium. This method ensures that the

228
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,680
entire plant is evenly nourished from

229
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:50,120
leaves to roots, supporting its recovery

230
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,120
and promoting more complete growth.

231
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,320
Spraying the solution onto the leaves,

232
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,320
stem, roots, and growing medium allows

233
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,279
the orchid to absorb nutrients in a

234
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,880
comprehensive way. Not only the roots,

235
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,959
but also the leaves and stem are

236
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,959
nourished, helping the plant stay

237
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,959
healthy and have enough energy to keep

238
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,959
blooming.

239
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,959
The fermented banana peel solution

240
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,760
contains beneficial microorganisms that

241
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,240
help prevent mold and pests. At the same

242
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,880
time, spraying also helps cool the plant

243
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,760
on hot days and maintain stable moisture

244
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,760
levels for healthy growth.

245
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,600
After the blooming period, orchids often

246
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,360
become weakened. Spraying fertilizer

247
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,279
rich in potassium and trace elements

248
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,600
from banana peels helps the plant

249
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,320
recover faster, strengthens the roots,

250
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:46,040
regenerates new leaves, and prepares for

251
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,040
the next blooming cycle.

252
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,880
However, you should avoid spraying the

253
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:55,639
solution directly on the flowers as wet

254
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,639
blooms tend to drop their petals easily.

255
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,560
Keeping the flowers dry not only helps

256
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,880
them last longer, but also preserves

257
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,680
their vibrant and fresh color throughout

258
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,440
the blooming period. This is a small but

259
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,560
very important tip to keep your orchids

260
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,560
looking beautiful and longlasting.

[Music]

262
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,480
Step three, use the remaining solution

263
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,880
to water directly at the base of each

264
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,639
orchid pot. This method allows the roots

265
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,720
to absorb nutrients slowly and

266
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,800
effectively, nourishing the plant from

267
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,680
within and stimulating strong root and

268
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:41,120
leaf growth.

[Music]

270
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,279
When watering this mixture at the base,

271
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,040
nutrients like potassium and trace

272
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,360
elements will soak deeply into the

273
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,560
roots, helping them grow strong, bright

274
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,160
white, and spread widely. Healthy roots

275
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,639
are the essential foundation for the

276
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,639
plant to absorb water and nutrients more

277
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,639
effectively.

278
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,639
Fermented banana peel fertilizer

279
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,959
provides natural energy that helps the

280
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,639
plant recover quickly after blooming. At

281
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,720
the same time, it stimulates the plant

282
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,800
to prepare for a new growth cycle,

283
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,080
resulting in the next blooms being more

284
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:22,179
uniform, vibrant, and longerlasting.

[Music]

286
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,279
Um, you only need to water with this

287
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,639
mixture about twice a month. This

288
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,720
frequency is enough to provide

289
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,560
consistent nutrition, helping the plant

290
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,560
recover after each blooming cycle

291
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,560
without causing excess or harming the

292
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,560
roots.

293
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,079
Step four. After spraying and watering,

294
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,839
use a clean, dry cloth to absorb any

295
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:49,270
remaining solution on the leaf surfaces

296
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,959
and in between the leaf joints.

[Music]

298
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,199
This helps keep the leaves dry and airy,

299
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,440
preventing prolonged moisture buildup

300
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,880
that could lead to leaf rot or create

301
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,880
favorable conditions for fungal

302
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,880
diseases.

303
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,120
Be sure to handle the leaves gently to

304
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:10,680
avoid damaging tender new growth or

305
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,680
breaking any leaves.

306
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,920
Um, you should gently wipe from the base

307
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,920
of the leaf toward the tip using a dry

308
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,160
cloth to absorb any remaining moisture

309
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,420
on the upper surface, underside, and

310
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,570

After completing the care steps, place

313
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:34,160
the orchid pot in a spot with gentle

314
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,920
sunlight and good ventilation.

315
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,320
Remember, no matter how good the

316
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,240
fertilizer is, if the plant lacks light,

317
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,800
its ability to absorb nutrients will

318
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,160
still be limited. Light is a crucial

319
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,160
factor that helps orchids

320
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,240
photosynthesize, develop roots and

321
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,800
leaves, and prepare for future blooming

322
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,480
cycles.

323
