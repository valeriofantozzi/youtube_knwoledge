00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:14,231
To help you have many options when caring for orchids at home with organic fertilizer.

3
00:00:16,897 --> 00:00:26,895
Helps develop new shoots. Flowers bloom profusely and last long.

4
00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:32,894
In this video, I continue to share new methods.

5
00:00:36,227 --> 00:00:46,891
To make this fertilizer, I reuse rice water when cooking rice.

6
00:00:50,890 --> 00:01:00,888
You can use 200 grams of rice like me or more which is also very good.

7
00:01:16,885 --> 00:01:26,883
After washing the rice, cover tightly and leave in a cool place for 24 hours.

8
00:01:35,882 --> 00:01:45,880
Next I used about 10 grams of fresh ginger.

9
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:58,877
Ginger has the ability to stimulate plant growth, helping orchids grow strongly and produce more leaves and flowers.

10
00:02:20,873 --> 00:02:30,871
After mincing, soak in 1 liter of boiled water.

11
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:39,869
and place in a cool place for 24 hours.

12
00:02:52,246 --> 00:02:56,899
24 HOURS LATER.

13
00:03:02,898 --> 00:03:12,896
Only decant the clear water above.

14
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:23,893
I do not use this cloudy water.

15
00:03:48,893 --> 00:03:52,888
FIRST METHOD.

16
00:03:52,889 --> 00:04:02,886
Clean the leaf surface with this liquid fertilizer.

17
00:04:06,305 --> 00:04:14,883
The leaf surface will always be clean and the stomata will be clear.

18
00:04:15,883 --> 00:04:21,882
Orchids will photosynthesize better.

19
00:04:22,882 --> 00:04:29,880
If applied regularly, you will not encounter this problem.

20
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:41,878
Leaves will always be green.

21
00:04:46,877 --> 00:04:50,876
SECOND METHOD.

22
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:58,875
Spray this fertilizer on the entire orchid.

23
00:05:00,874 --> 00:05:10,872
Minerals contained in ginger and fermented rice water will help stimulate rooting and shoot growth very well.

24
00:05:12,672 --> 00:05:20,870
Do this once a month to supplement nutrition and increase the orchid's resistance.

25
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:25,869
THIRD METHOD.

26
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:34,868
Now take this liquid fertilizer mixture and water it on the orchid roots.

27
00:05:39,388 --> 00:05:48,898
Fertilizer from ginger and naturally fermented rice water helps supplement nutrients

28
00:05:48,898 --> 00:05:58,896
and amino acids that are beneficial for orchid growth.

29
00:06:01,857 --> 00:06:11,894
Especially helps stimulate germination and rooting extremely quickly.

30
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,892
ONE MONTH LATER.

31
00:06:23,237 --> 00:06:31,890
Roots begin to sprout.

32
00:06:52,885 --> 00:06:55,885
AFTER 2 MONTH.

33
00:06:58,884 --> 00:07:08,882
The roots grow very healthily, helping the orchid absorb the most nutrients.

34
00:07:21,435 --> 00:07:25,879
AFTER THE NEXT 2 MONTHS.

35
00:07:30,878 --> 00:07:42,875
Many buds develop.

36
00:07:49,615 --> 00:07:59,872
New sprouts grow very strong and grow quickly.

37
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:16,869
AFTER THE NEXT 3 MONTHS.

38
00:08:19,712 --> 00:08:26,900
bloom many flowers.

39
00:08:30,903 --> 00:08:38,898
The flower color is more vibrant than usual.

40
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:53,895
The flowers stay on the branches for a long time before fading.

41
00:09:39,886 --> 00:09:51,883
In my hand is a phalaenopsis orchid with bacterial rot.

42
00:10:04,881 --> 00:10:23,877
First I need to check the roots for damage.

43
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:44,873
So this orchid is completely root damaged.

44
00:10:51,871 --> 00:11:18,899
All damaged roots need to be removed.

45
00:11:39,895 --> 00:11:54,892
Rinse with water.

46
00:13:06,878 --> 00:13:14,876
Take 100ml of boiled water and let it cool.

47
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:24,874
Take 1 teaspoon of dried garlic powder.

48
00:13:39,871 --> 00:13:47,870
Soak the orchid root in garlic water for 30 minutes.

49
00:13:50,869 --> 00:14:00,867
In the meantime I recycle this foam sheet into a tool to revive orchids.

50
00:16:27,872 --> 00:16:48,834
Pour filtered water into the tank.

51
00:16:59,865 --> 00:17:10,896
then put the orchid in a cool place.

52
00:17:12,896 --> 00:17:22,894
and change the water when the water is dirty.

53
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:43,890
3 WEEKS AFTER.

54
00:17:46,889 --> 00:17:56,887
orchids have taken root in the water.

55
00:18:10,884 --> 00:18:20,882
In this way, the orchid's roots grow very quickly.

56
00:18:44,878 --> 00:18:54,876

58
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:36,867
Now I plant in pots so that the orchids grow in the outside environment.

59
00:19:47,899 --> 00:20:08,894
Orchid growing medium I choose aquaponic medium and a little moss to keep the surface moist.

60
00:21:07,883 --> 00:21:15,881
Now we will discover together the secret to watering orchids,

61
00:21:16,881 --> 00:21:24,879
so that they always bloom and grow with magical roots.

62
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:32,878
With a little patience and care,

63
00:21:32,878 --> 00:21:42,876
You will find that taking care of these plants is not as difficult as you think!.

64
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:52,874
First of all, the irrigation technique is not correct.

65
00:21:53,874 --> 00:22:12,870
Do not water directly from the faucet for orchids like this.

66
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:37,898
And you should not water directly on the top of the orchid like this.

67
00:22:40,898 --> 00:22:50,896
You should also not water directly on the flowers.

68
00:22:52,895 --> 00:23:04,893
The above 3 watering methods are easy to make orchids stamp leaves, rot leaves, and rot flowers.

69
00:23:04,893 --> 00:23:38,886
like these orchids.

70
00:23:47,884 --> 00:24:08,880
You need to observe the roots and the growing medium to decide whether to water or not.

71
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:26,877
If the roots are still green and the substrate is still moist like this, no watering is needed.

72
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:52,871
But when you see the roots turn white and the medium is too dry like this, you need to water the orchid immediately.

73
00:24:55,871 --> 00:25:03,869
First way.

74
00:25:07,869 --> 00:25:17,900
Soak the orchid pot in water for 20-30 minutes every month.

75
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:28,898
This helps to remove excess mineral salts in the orchid growing medium.

76
00:25:29,897 --> 00:25:47,894
This also helps the orchid get the best water.

77
00:25:52,893 --> 00:25:56,892
2nd way.

78
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:08,890
You water directly on the root but do not wet the stem and leaves of the orchid.

79
00:26:12,889 --> 00:26:16,888
3rd way.

80
00:26:16,888 --> 00:26:26,886
Spray a moisturizing mist on the top and bottom of the leaves.

81
00:26:41,883 --> 00:26:59,880
In this way, after watering, you need to dry the shoots and interstitial leaves.

82
00:27:17,876 --> 00:27:33,873
This way I apply regularly and the leaves are always green and clean.

83
00:27:36,872 --> 00:27:47,870
When the orchid is watered with enough moisture and nutrition,

84
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:59,868
it will develop a lot of flower buds like this orchid of mine.

85
00:28:02,867 --> 00:28:12,899
Leaves are sturdy and disease free.

86
00:28:14,898 --> 00:28:24,896
Blooming flowers are brightly colored.

87
00:28:27,896 --> 00:28:39,893
very fat flower buds.

88
00:28:40,893 --> 00:28:50,891
This helps the petals bloom wider and stay fresh longer.

89
00:28:53,890 --> 00:29:03,888
spread enough water will not wilt.

90
00:29:04,888 --> 00:29:14,886
Enough moisture roots easily absorb nutrients.

91
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:26,884
If the orchid has enough water and nutrients, the flower can be kept on the branch for up to 6 months before it falls.

92
00:29:31,883 --> 00:29:43,881
Adequate watering will help the roots grow stronger.

93
00:29:49,879 --> 00:30:02,877
Healthy roots will also better absorb water and nutrients.

94
00:30:03,877 --> 00:30:14,874
Helps orchids increase resistance to pests.

95
00:30:18,874 --> 00:30:28,872
