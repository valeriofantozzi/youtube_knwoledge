Hello everyone, to easily care for orchids to always grow healthily.

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:15,897
There are more flower buds and flowers stay on the branches longer.

3
00:00:15,897 --> 00:00:24,896
Today I share a very easy way to keep orchids growing healthily.

4
00:00:32,894 --> 00:00:40,892
When eating bananas, don't throw away the peel.

5
00:00:40,892 --> 00:00:50,890
Because banana peels contain many nutrients, especially organic potassium.

6
00:00:50,890 --> 00:01:01,888
Very good for the growth of buds, flowers and has anti-drought effects.

7
00:01:05,408 --> 00:01:15,885
I cut the banana peel thinly and put it in a jar.

8
00:01:29,883 --> 00:01:36,881
Next I took a piece of bread.

9
00:01:36,881 --> 00:01:46,879
Bread contains phosphorus, which plays an important role in plant growth, especially stimulating root growth.

10
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:20,873
Adding 1 teaspoon of yeast helps decompose organic matter faster and prevents it from rotting.

11
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:32,870
And adding a spoonful of sugar helps nourish the growth of beneficial microorganisms.

12
00:02:34,295 --> 00:02:36,295
Add 500ml warm water.

13
00:02:56,899 --> 00:03:06,897
Then leave in a cool place for 3 weeks.

14
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:16,895
3 Weeks later.

15
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:26,893
Take 2 liters of water.

16
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:43,889
After 3 weeks of composting we have this wonderful fertilizer.

17
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:54,887
Take 50ml.

18
00:03:56,887 --> 00:04:06,885
then mix into water.

19
00:04:15,883 --> 00:04:20,882
Method 1: Fertilize the roots.

20
00:04:23,882 --> 00:04:33,880
Water each orchid pot with this water 5-10 spoons per week.

21
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:50,876
This fertilizer provides potassium, an important mineral that improves plant health and vitality.

22
00:05:00,096 --> 00:05:10,872
This type of fertilizer also helps retain water and enhances the plant's ability to absorb water.

23
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:26,869
Beneficial fungi Mycorrhiza will grow to help the plant more easily absorb nutrients from the orchid growing medium.

24
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:39,900
Method 2.

25
00:05:51,773 --> 00:05:58,896
Use this water to spray on the leaves.

26
00:06:04,778 --> 00:06:12,893
Helps supplement nutrients through leaves very effectively.

27
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:29,890
Helps orchid leaves become strong and healthy.

28
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:44,887
and sprayed on aerial roots to help aerial roots grow and easily absorb nutrients in the air.

29
00:06:50,641 --> 00:07:00,884
You should do it early in the morning and by noon the leaves will dry very quickly.

30
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:18,880
Do this once a week to keep the orchid healthy.

31
00:07:30,878 --> 00:07:33,877
Method 3:

32
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:42,875
Now I wash the leaves with this water.

33
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:56,873
Beneficial microorganisms will help kill mold and insects very effectively.

34
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:09,870
Do this every 2 weeks to protect your orchids.

35
00:08:24,867 --> 00:08:27,900
Result

36
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:39,898
After fertilizing, orchids will always be green and healthy.

37
00:08:48,815 --> 00:08:58,894
Potassium in banana peels and bread helps flower buds grow strongly.

38
00:09:08,892 --> 00:09:18,890
When the flowers bloom, they will stay on the branches for a long time.

39
00:09:26,888 --> 00:09:36,886
Flowers can last on branches for up to 6 months before fading.

40
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:50,883
Hopefully the video will help you a lot in taking better care of orchids at home.

41
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:59,882
Thank you for watching the video. Good luck and see you in the next videos!
