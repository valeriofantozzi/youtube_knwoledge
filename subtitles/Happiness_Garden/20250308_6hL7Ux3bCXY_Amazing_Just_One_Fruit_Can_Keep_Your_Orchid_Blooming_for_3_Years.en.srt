00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:39,079
photosynthesis because clean leaves

197
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:42,759
absorb light better and can metabolize

198
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:42,759
energy more efficiently

199
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,160
wiping leaves with this water helps

200
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,959
reduce the risk of mold bacterial

201
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,600
diseases because clean Leaf surfaces

202
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:11,439
limit the environment for harmful

203
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,439
pathogens to grow

206
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,360

209
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,760
for orchids boosting their resistance

210
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:04,080
promoting quick recovery after blooming

211
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,080
and ensuring continuous

212
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,880
flowering thoroughly spray both the top

213
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,880
and bottom of the

214
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,960
leaves when sprayed on leaves liquid

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,120
fertilizer helps orchids absorb

216
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,120
nutrients more easily and enhance root

liquid fertilizer solution that is very

225
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:29,559
good for orchids to recover after

236
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:17,600
orchids uh soak the Orchid pot for 20

237
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,960
minutes so the Orchid can absorb the

238
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,960
most nutrients

239
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,679
after soaking for about 20 minutes take

240
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:38,000
it out take it out and place the Orchid

241
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:38,000
pot in a place with plenty of

242
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:48,760
light step

243
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,919
four water droplets on leaves can create

244
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,520
a favorable environment for mold and

245
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:53,520
bacteria to

246
00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:00,600
grow wiping off water helps reduce the

247
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,600
risk of

248
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:12,200
infection wiping off the water helps the

249
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,200
stomata stay open and function

250
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:31,360
better and do the above four steps every

251
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:31,360
10 to 15

252
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,720
days remember no matter how good the

253
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,760
fertilizer is if the Orchid lacks light

254
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:51,400
growth and cannot photosynthesize it

255
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,400
will still be stunted and grow slowly

256
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,120
therefore place the Orchid in a location

257
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,120
with sufficient light for Healthy

258
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Growth results after 50

259
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:31,760
days you can see the roots and leaves of

260
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:31,760
the Orchid growing very

261
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,480
quickly the leaves are also stronger and

262
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:53,320
glossier and also grew two new flower

263
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,320
buds

264
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,919
oh the roots in the Orchid pot grow so

265
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,919
well

266
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,240
new roots are an important factor in

267
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:42,039
helping orchids grow healthfully and

268
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,039
sustainably throughout their life cycle

269
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,720
sh

270
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,799
um now I plant it in a larger pot so the

271
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,799
Orchid grows

272
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:48,399
healthier as a growing medium I use

273
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:52,760
crushed pine bark to help aate the roots

274
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:52,760
but still retain the necessary moisture

275
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:22,399
after planting take care of it like

276
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,399
other normal orchids

277
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,520
take care of your Orchids with all the

278
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,399
love and dedication you have for nature

279
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,480
because every leaf and every flower bud

280
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:41,200
is a testament to the effort and heart

281
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,200
