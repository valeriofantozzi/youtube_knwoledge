And share so as many people know.

6
00:00:39,893 --> 00:00:43,803
Let's start

7
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:55,889
I cut this old orchid for propagation.

8
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:09,187
Cut again so the cut is flat and will not rot further

9
00:01:16,396 --> 00:01:26,383
Applying cinnamon powder to the cut helps the wound heal quickly and not rot.

10
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:36,915
Then wait a day for the cutting to dry completely before planting the orchid.

11
00:01:43,093 --> 00:01:45,880
1 Day Later

12
00:01:47,089 --> 00:01:55,078
Take 1 aloe vera leaf and cut it into thin slices

13
00:01:56,469 --> 00:02:05,465
Aloe vera gel is very good at restoring wilted orchids and reviving baby orchids.

14
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:15,307
Then take 2 cloves of garlic and cut them into thin slices.

15
00:02:15,307 --> 00:02:24,417
Garlic has antibacterial and antiseptic properties that help protect orchids from rotting.

16
00:02:36,162 --> 00:02:45,868
Put garlic and aloe vera in the jar and add 500ml of water

17
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:22,127
The cut is completely dry

18
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:38,691
Soaking in this water for 30 minutes helps stimulate germination and rooting.

19
00:03:43,298 --> 00:03:50,288
Recycle used plastic bottles as orchid nursery tools.

20
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:40,079
Then put the dry orchid branches into this plastic bottle.

21
00:04:49,374 --> 00:04:58,342
Place the bottle here and insert moss around it to help retain moisture.

22
00:05:33,535 --> 00:05:43,566
Water regularly to keep the environment moist.

23
00:05:45,685 --> 00:05:52,897
This helps the orchid germinate faster.

24
00:06:09,173 --> 00:06:19,892
Then put it in a cool place and wait for the orchid to revive.

25
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:26,891
45 Days Later

26
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:08,583
With this method, after only 45 days, old withered orchid branches have been revived.

27
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,541
Now I cut them out to plant in pots.

28
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:59,872
I plant with pine bark soaked in antiseptic to prevent the tree from rotting.

29
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:20,868
Adding a little moss helps retain moisture and protect the roots better.

30
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:50,562
Then you water it to keep it moist and take care of it like other normal orchids.

31
00:08:51,562 --> 00:08:58,561
