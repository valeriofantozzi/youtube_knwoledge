00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,480
Welcome to my little orchid garden where

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,160
each petal is nurtured with love and

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,160
passion. Today I will guide you on how

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,480
to propagate orchids at home using the

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,759
stem cutting method. Simple yet

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,520
effective. The ideal time for stem

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,920
cutting is when the orchid flowers begin

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,640
to fade. When the plant enters its

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,320
resting phase and is ready for new

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,680
growth. This flower stem is the ideal

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,119
time to take a cutting, helping the

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,119
plant grow stronger.

[Music]

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,240
Keep the unopened buds like this for

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,159
stem cutting as they contain dormant

17
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,159
shoots that can sprout into new orchid

18
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,159
plants.

19
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,560
As for the positions where the flowers

20
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,600
have bloomed, you should cut them off as

21
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:32,119
they no longer contain uh dormant buds

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,119
to develop into new orchid plants.

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,909
[Music]

24
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,960
I keep these two dormant buds for stem

25
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,680
cutting and later the new orchid plant

26
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,680
will grow from here.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,239
I cut across here to avoid crushing the

28
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,239
cut as crushed areas are prone to

29
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,239
infection and can affect the plant's

30
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,239
growth.

31
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,879
At the base of the cutting, I make a

32
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,360
diagonal cut to create a larger contact

33
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:54,120
surface, which helps the cutting absorb

34
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,120
water and nutrients more effectively.

35
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,519
Then I sprinkle turmeric powder on the

36
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,920
cut. This helps with antibacterial

37
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:14,280
protection, uh, prevents rot and

38
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,280
promotes faster healing of the wound.

39
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,080
After that, I leave the cutting for a

40
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,159
few hours without watering to let the

41
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,400
cut dry, reducing the risk of infection

42
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,400
when planting.

43
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,040
After that, you use rice, a material

44
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,360
rich in B vitamins and essential

45
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,680
minerals to support the orchid stem

46
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,680
cutting

47
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,880
process. Take 3 tablesp of rice and

48
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:25,000
dilute it with.5 L of water to create a

49
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,000
solution for soaking the cutings.

50
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,639
Cover the lid and let it sit for a few

51
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,360
hours to allow the nutrients from the

52
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,360
rice to fully dissolve.

53
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,479
Cover the lid and let it sit for a few

54
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,199
hours to allow the nutrients from the

55
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,199
rice to fully

56
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,720
dissolve. Dilute the turmeric powder

57
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:18,759
with 0.5 L of water to create a solution

58
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,759
for soaking the stem cutings.

59
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,320
Cover the lid and let the solution sit

60
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,919
for a few hours to allow the nutrients

61
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,720
from the turmeric powder to fully

62
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,720
dissolve into the water.

63
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,759
After 3 hours of soaking, I proceed to

64
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:57,080
filter the turmeric water to use for the

65
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,080
stem cutings.

66
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,720
Make sure to filter out the residue as

67
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:21,000
it can cause blockages and affect the

68
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,000
cutting's ability to absorb nutrients.

[Music]

70
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,240
Step one, use a soft cloth to soak up

71
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,199
the turmeric solution and gently wipe it

72
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,199
onto the stem

73
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:52,160
cutting. This method helps protect the

74
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:56,919
cut, prevent infection, and stimulate

75
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,919
the rooting process of the stem cutting.

76
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,199
Then use this mixture to wipe both the

77
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,440
top and bottom surfaces of the stem

78
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,120
cutting, helping to enhance nutrient

79
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,599
absorption and protect the plant from

80
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,599
pests and diseases.

90
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,080
Then mix the rice water with the

91
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,479
turmeric water to create the perfect

92
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,960
nutrient solution, helping the rooting

and growth process of the stem cutting

94
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:35,519
improve. When mixing, make sure to

95
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,919
filter the rice water thoroughly to

96
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,919
remove any residue, making the solution

97
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,080
cleaner and easier for the stem cutting

98
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,080
to absorb.

99
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,560
After mixing, soak the stem cutting in

100
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,480
this mixture for about 20 minutes to

101
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,370
allow the nutrients to be absorbed into

After soaking for 20 minutes, take the

127
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:02,680
stem cutting out to proceed with placing

128
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,680
it in the prepared container.

129
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,959
Then add bottled water or cooled boiled

130
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,959
water enough to submerge the floral

131
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,959

water enough to submerge the floral

134
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:55,839

plastic lid and place it in a spot with

136
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:01,160
gentle sunlight for the stem cutting to

137
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,160
develop well.

138
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,360
Um, the remaining mixture I used to

139
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,120
water the roots of the orchids in the

140
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,120
garden to provide nutrients to the

141
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:26,160
plants. Water each plant with about 10

142
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,160
tablespoons as this amount provides

143
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,020
enough nutrients without overwatering

144
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,090
the plant.

145
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,090
[Music]

146
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,880
This mixture helps the orchid strengthen

147
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,680
its rooting ability, promoting strong

148
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,680
growth from the

149
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:47,360
base. The vitamins and minerals in this

150
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:50,839
mixture help the orchid resist pests and

151
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,839
harmful factors.

152
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,720
Watering with this mixture helps the

153
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,399
orchid absorb nutrients better, leading

154
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,200
to the production of beautiful and

155
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,200
long-lasting

156
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,880
flowers. You can water each orchid pot

157
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,720
with this mixture one to two times a

158
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:22,120
month to provide consistent nutrients

159
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,120
for the plants.

160
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:36,360
Now, let's take a look at the results

161
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,360
after 1 month of stem cutting.

162
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,480
As you can see, the stem cutting has

163
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,639
sprouted two new orchid plants from the

164
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,959
dormant buds, proving that the cutting

165
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:58,279
process was successful and the plant is

166
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,279
growing well.

167
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,279
The young orchid plant may be small, but

168
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,639
it has already started growing roots,

169
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:12,800
showing that the plant is developing

170
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,800
healthily and is getting ready to

171
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:23,839
mature. I will continue to keep the stem

172
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:26,240
cutting in the container to allow the

173
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:29,959
orchid to grow larger before planting it

174
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,959
in the outside environment.

175
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,360
Um, when the water becomes cloudy or has

176
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,040
a strange smell, you should change it

177
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,240
immediately to prevent bacteria from

178
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,240
developing and harming the

179
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:50,880
cutings. Use filtered water or boiled

180
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,120
water that has cooled down when

181
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,199
replacing it to maintain a clean

182
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,680
environment and promote faster root

183
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,680
growth for the cutings.

184
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,160
Then place the cutings in a spot with

185
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,240
gentle sunlight to help the plant absorb

186
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,720
light, stimulate root growth, and

187
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,720
prevent leaf

188
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:19,880
burn. And here is the result after 2

189
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,880
months of rooting the cutings.

190
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,320
You can see that the roots have grown

191
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,320
strong and healthy, proving that the

192
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,880
correct care method has yielded

193
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,880
excellent results.

[Music]

195
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,279
When the orchid seedlings are healthy

196
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,959
and the roots have developed well, that

197
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,920
is the ideal time to separate them and

198
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,920
plant them into new

199
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,199
pots. Uh this helps the orchids have

200
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,880
more space to grow, which in turn

201
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,880
promotes strong growth in the new

202
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,880
environment.

203
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,720
Plant the orchid in a pot with good

204
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,959
drainage holes to ensure that water

205
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,839
doesn't accumulate, helping the roots

206
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:27,839
avoid rot and promoting healthier

207
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,600
growth. I choose pine bark chips as the

208
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,399
growing medium because it has good

209
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,720
drainage capacity, helps maintain stable

210
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,440
moisture levels for the orchids without

211
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,720
causing water logging, and also provides

212
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,720
essential nutrients for root

213
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,720
development.

214
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,440
I choose pine bark chips as the growing

215
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,240
medium because it has good drainage

216
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,560
capacity, helps maintain stable moisture

217
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,880
levels for the orchids without causing

218
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,160
water logging and also provides

219
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,160
essential nutrients for root

220
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,160
development.

How do you find my orchid cutting

222
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,240
tutorial video? Please leave a comment

223
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,240
below the video to let me know your

224
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,160
thoughts. Spread a little moss on top of

225
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,240
the pot before placing the orchid

226
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,640
seedling in to help retain moisture

227
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,880
better. create ideal conditions for the

228
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,679
plant's growth and prevent water from

229
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,679
evaporating too

230
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,600
quickly. Thank you for watching the

231
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,480
video. I wish you success with your

232
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,480
orchids. Goodbye and see you in the next
