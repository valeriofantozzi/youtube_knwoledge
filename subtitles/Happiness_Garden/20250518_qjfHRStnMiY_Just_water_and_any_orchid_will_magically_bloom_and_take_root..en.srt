00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,360

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,800
to watering orchids so they always bloom

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,800

With just a little patience and care,

8
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:36,320
you will see that taking care of these

9
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:47,039

11
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,960
First, we need to understand the

12
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:54,640
incorrect watering techniques for

13
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,310
orchids. Do not water orchids like these

14
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:14,930
directly from the tap.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,430
And you should not water directly on the

orchid crown like this.

23
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,640
methods can easily cause the orchid to

24
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,040
have damaged leaves, rotten leaves, and

25
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,040
rotten flowers.

Like these orchid plants that have stem

28
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,200
and leaf rot caused by water

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,200
accumulation, which leads to fungal

30
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,830
growth, causing the stem and leaves to

31
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:28,069
rot.

[Music]

34
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,560
Um, you need to observe the roots and

35
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,360
the growing medium to decide whether to

36
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,360
water or not.

If the roots are still green and the

39
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:18,599
growing medium is still moist like this,

40
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,599
then there is no need to water.

42
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,560
But when you see the roots turn white

43
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,480
and the growing medium is too dry like

44
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,480
this, you need to water the orchid

45
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,480
immediately.

70
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,580
