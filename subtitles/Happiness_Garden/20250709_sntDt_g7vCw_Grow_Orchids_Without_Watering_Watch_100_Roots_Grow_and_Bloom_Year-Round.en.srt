00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,800
the gentle beauty of nature. This is the

00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,240
helps even busy people care for orchids

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:22,920
easily. So, the plant stays healthy and

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,920
blooms all four seasons of the year.

It's truly wonderful to have you along

[Music]

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,000
Uh, this is an orchid with a mushy

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,960
rotten leaf that I bought as a clearance

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
item from a small local flower shop.

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,559
The price was only $2, but I believe

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,559
that with a little love and proper care,

21
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,359
the plant still has a chance to recover

22
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,359
and bloom beautifully.

23
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,640
First, we need to remove the rotten part

24
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,439
of the leaf to prevent the disease from

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,439
spreading.

26
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,119
But before pruning, don't forget to

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,360
sterilize your tools with 90% alcohol to

28
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,119
ensure the plant's safety and prevent

29
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,119
the infection from spreading to other

30
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,119
parts.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,640
The rotten part of the leaf often

32
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,640
harbors many fungal pathogens. If not

33
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,720
treated promptly, they will quickly

34
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,040
spread to other parts, especially in hot

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,380
and humid weather conditions, the ideal

36
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,480
environment for pathogens to thrive.

[Music]

38
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,520
After treating the leaf, the next step

39
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,770
is to check the roots and the growing

40
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,880
medium.

41
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:57,680
[Music]

42
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,520
Moss growing medium is often chosen by

43
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,000
orchid farms because of its good

44
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,920
moisture retention and lightweight,

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,399
which helps the plant grow easily during

46
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,399
the early stages.

47
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,760
However, if used for a long time without

48
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,920
being replaced, moss can easily become

49
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,920
infected with fungi or retain too much

50
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,920
water, which may lead to root rot.

51
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,440
And as you can see, the growing medium

52
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,040
has been infected with white mold, a

53
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,760
sign that the environment is no longer

54
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,920
clean and safe for the plant. If left as

55
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,720
is, the orchid roots will be easily

56
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:41,040
damaged and weaken quickly.

Next, gently trim away any roots that

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,640
are hollow or damaged.

74
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,400
Damaged roots are often breeding grounds

75
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,080
for mold and bacteria. If not removed,

76
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,440
they can easily spread to healthy roots

77
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,440
and cause the plant to weaken quickly.

78
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,720
By removing the damaged roots, the plant

79
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,200
no longer has to carry the burden of

80
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,120
nonfunctional parts, allowing it to

81
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,799
focus its energy on nourishing healthy

82
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,799
roots, and stimulating new root growth.

83
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,159
Cleaning the roots helps improve air

84
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,159
flow in the pot, reduces water logging,

85
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,620
and creates ideal conditions for the

86
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:16,779
plant to recover after repotting.

89
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,280
After trimming the damaged roots, rinse

90
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,600
the entire plant thoroughly under

91
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,600
running water.

92
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,120
This helps remove any remaining residue,

93
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,440
dirt, and pathogens from the roots and

94
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,840
stem.

95
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,600
After rinsing, place the plant in a well

96
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,680
ventilated area overnight to let the

97
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,720
cuts dry and prevent fungal infection

98
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,320
when repotting.

99
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,240
To make a fertilizer that helps

100
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,160
stimulate orchid recovery and growth, I

101
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,520
use a simple and easy to find

102
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,680
ingredient, ginger.

103
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,600
Take about 10 grams of ginger,

104
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,840
preferably the part with sprouts, as it

105
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,000
contains a high amount of oxin, a

106
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,840
natural substance that stimulates

107
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,600
growth, especially effective in

108
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,240
promoting fast and healthy development

109
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,240
of young roots.

110
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:45,600
After slicing it thinly, place the

111
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,600
prepared ginger into a clean bottle.

112
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,880
Using a clean bottle helps ensure that

113
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,720
the solution remains free from

114
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,120
contamination during fermentation and

115
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,120
future use.

116
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,280
Next, add about 500 ml of warm water

117
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,280
into the bottle.

118
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,479
Warm water will help speed up the

119
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,400
fermentation process, allowing the

120
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,960
nutrients in the ginger to be released

121
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,330
more effectively, making it easier for

122
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,459
the plant to absorb when used.

[Music]

124
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,919
The next ingredient is molasses.

125
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,400
This natural ingredient supports the

126
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,560
fermentation process by promoting the

127
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,000
growth of beneficial microorganisms

128
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,160
while also providing additional

129
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,560
nutrients to the orchid during its

130
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,560
recovery phase.

131
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,680
Just one teaspoon of molasses is enough.

132
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,000
It's a small amount, but sufficient to

133
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,520
stimulate fermentation and nourish the

134
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,520
beneficial microorganisms in the

135
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,520
solution.

136
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,400
Then stir the mixture well to fully

137
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,639
dissolve the ginger and molasses in the

138
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,080

139
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,039
process occur more evenly and

140
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:14,039
effectively.

141
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,039
Close

142
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,479
the bottle tightly, then place it in a

143
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,360
cool, wellventilated area away from

144
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,039
direct sunlight. After about 3 weeks,

145
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,919
you'll have a natural fertilizer made

146
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,919
from ginger, commonly known as GE, which

147
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,479
is excellent for helping orchids recover

148
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,479
and grow healthily.

149
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,800
And this is the bottle of ginger GE I

150
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,639
prepared 3 weeks ago. After the

151
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,960
fermentation period, the solution has

152
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,199
fully fermented with a mild distinctive

153
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,360
ginger aroma and is now ready to use for

154
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,360
the orchids.

155
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,960
Take 30 ml of ginger GE to dilute and

156
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,960
use as fertilizer for the orchids.

160
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,959
effective ratio providing enough

161
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,360
nutrients for the plant without harming

162

the young roots.

163
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,600
After being left overnight, the cuts on

164
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,600
the roots have dried. At this point,

165
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,760
gently place the orchid roots into a

plant for repotting.

178

While waiting for the roots to soak, you

179
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,680
can use a soft cloth dipped in the

180
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:04,120
solution to gently wipe both the upper

181
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,120
and lower surfaces of the leaves.

182
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,839
Wiping the leaves helps remove dust and

183
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,560
bacteria from the surface, allowing the

184
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,880
leaves to breathe better and absorb

185
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,880
light more efficiently, an important

186
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,200
factor in helping the plant grow strong

187
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,200

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,040

214
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,600
helps keep the roots well ventilated and

215
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,600
reduces the risk of water logging and

I use a piece of floral foam to cover

the bottom of the pot. This helps

220
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,519
prevent the growing medium from falling

221
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:42,200

Don't worry about the orchid drying out,

as orchids are naturally drought

287
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,039
provide moisture to the lower roots

288
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,640
without soaking the upper ones. This is

289
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,559
an important principle in the

290

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,400
With this growing method, we don't need

293
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,960
to water frequently, yet the plant still

294
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,960
maintains stable moisture. This helps

295
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,880

296
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,320

About 1 to two weeks later, once the

303
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,960

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:27,039
efficiently, leading to vigorous growth.

381
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,280
In the coming time, the plant will

382
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,200
produce lush green leaves and bloom

383
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,200
brilliantly, bringing new life to your

384
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,200
garden.

385
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,159
That's why roots are often compared to

386
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,240
the heart of the orchid. Roots not only

387
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,400
transport water and nutrients, but also

388
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:53,080
play a crucial role in maintaining the

389
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,080
plant's vitality and sustainable growth.

390
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,200
Uh, what do you think about how I

391
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,720
restored this orchid with a rotten leaf?

392
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,640
Don't hesitate to leave a comment and

393
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,840
share your thoughts. I'm eager to hear

394
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,840
your feedback and experiences.

395
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,159
And here is the orchid I planted using

396
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,000
the semihydroponic method. You can see

397
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,559
the plant has fully recovered and is

398
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,480
blooming brilliantly, bringing joy and

399
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:21,480
satisfaction after the patient care

400
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,480
process.

401
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,360
Though the orchid is small, its roots

402
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,360
have grown very strong.

403
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,080
The petals are soft, fully open, and

404
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:40,760
vibrant in color, creating an elegant

405
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,760
and lively beauty for the entire pot.

407
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,240
This simple growing method is perfect

408
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,240
for busy people or beginners caring for

409
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,880
orchids, helping you easily keep the

410
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:57,089
plant healthy and blooming regularly.

412
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,000
Remember, every orchid you care for is

413
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,559
not just a plant, but a result of love,

414
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,520
patience, and passion.

415
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:09,760
No matter the difficulties or setbacks,

416
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,360
don't give up because it's the small

417
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,679
daily efforts that create great

418
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,870
miracles, turning your garden into a

419
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,320
place full of life and happiness.
