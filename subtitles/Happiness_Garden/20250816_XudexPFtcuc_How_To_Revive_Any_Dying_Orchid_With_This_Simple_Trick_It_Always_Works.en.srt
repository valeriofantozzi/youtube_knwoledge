Welcome to Happiness Garden.

00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,200
This is where I share how to care for

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,800
and revive orchids using natural methods

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,719
and organic fertilizers.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,000
Uh let's make your orchids healthy and

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,000
bloom more beautifully than ever.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,480
If you have a wilted orchid like this

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,480
one, don't throw it away just yet.

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,439
In this video, I'll share how to revive

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,439
it and help it grow strong again.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,879
This orchid wasn't cared for properly

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,360
after blooming, causing it to weaken and

13
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:45,160
become stunted. Without timely recovery,

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,160
the orchid might die.

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,310
First, cut off all the damaged roots to

16
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,039
help the orchid recover better.

This mixture helps revive wilted leaves

by providing essential nutrients and

77
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,080

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,160
growth and cakey development thanks to

79
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,240
the natural compounds in aloe vera and

85
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,000
Then soak the orchid in this mixture for

86
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,960
about 20 minutes to allow the plant to

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,960

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,840

potassium, phosphor, and protein uh

activity of this micrllora in the orchid

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,919
When roots grow, they will absorb

nutrients to make flowers more

291
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,520
