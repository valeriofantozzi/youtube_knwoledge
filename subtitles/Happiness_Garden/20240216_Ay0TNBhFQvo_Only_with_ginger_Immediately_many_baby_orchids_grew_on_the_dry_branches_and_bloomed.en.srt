Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:05,487 --> 00:00:10,518
Today I will show you how to propagate orchids

3
00:00:10,518 --> 00:00:15,188
from wilted orchids.

4
00:01:46,882 --> 00:01:52,616
Use about 10g of ginger.

5
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:22,872
Squeeze out ginger juice

6
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:38,106
Ginger has a very good antiseptic effect

7
00:02:38,106 --> 00:02:51,947
At the same time, ginger also helps to stimulate germination very quickly

8
00:03:03,734 --> 00:03:18,434
Wait 5 minutes for the ginger juice to penetrate the orchid branch.

9
00:03:21,163 --> 00:03:31,040
Then take it out and let it dry.

10
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:57,984
Do this so that the water does not penetrate the orchid branch.

11
00:03:57,984 --> 00:04:13,770
It will help the orchid not to rot.

12
00:04:20,683 --> 00:04:32,067
Use 1 spoon of white cement.

13
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:40,347
Add 500ml of water.

14
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:50,158
Stir well and wait for the water to clear.

15
00:04:52,388 --> 00:05:20,738
Soak moss in clear cement water to disinfect.

16
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:50,534
I will recycle these plastic items to grow orchids.

17
00:06:26,956 --> 00:06:58,334
Make a drainage hole.

18
00:07:33,301 --> 00:07:52,500
Put the orchid here and spray it with a moisturizing mist once a week.

19
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:10,460
AFTER 3 WEEKS.

20
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:30,651
Lan has revived new sprouts.

21
00:08:37,485 --> 00:08:44,375
Continue misting moisturizer once a week.

22
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:51,186
waiting for the preschool to grow up.

23
00:09:00,544 --> 00:09:09,067
AFTER 2 MONTHS OF WAIT

24
00:09:09,067 --> 00:09:15,142
WOW

25
00:09:15,142 --> 00:09:33,162
The little orchid has grown very healthy.

26
00:09:33,162 --> 00:09:43,734
So with this simple way we can easily propagate orchids.

27
00:09:43,734 --> 00:09:52,698
Hope it helps you guys.
