Welcome to my channel.

00:00:05,033 --> 00:00:15,489
Today I share a new way to help restore this withered orchid

3
00:00:15,489 --> 00:00:57,271
First you need to cut off the damaged roots

4
00:01:08,342 --> 00:01:27,586
Next, apply the candle to the spot you just cut so that the water does not seep into the body of the orchid.

5
00:01:38,961 --> 00:01:45,503
Take filtered water at room temperature.

6
00:01:45,503 --> 00:01:56,944
Add coconut fiber to keep moisture

7
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:41,232
Apply the gel of the onion to the stem of the orchid to stimulate growth

8
00:03:18,456 --> 00:03:35,304
Keep in a place with daylight and do not place in direct sunlight because sunlight will cause orchids to rot.

9
00:03:35,304 --> 00:03:51,794
AFTER 2 WEEKS

10
00:03:57,043 --> 00:04:11,001
The orchid stem is fresh again and grows a small sprout

11
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:42,720
AFTER 2 MONTHS

12
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,899
Plant in a pot so the orchid can grow in the outside environment

13
00:06:00,487 --> 00:06:03,895
Welcome to part 2 of the video

14
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:10,894
When orchids have enough nutrients and a good soil environment,

15
00:06:10,894 --> 00:06:16,892
The plant will grow strongly and flower more.

16
00:06:16,892 --> 00:06:25,891
In this video, I share a type of fertilizer that few people know about.

17
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:31,889
Come explore with me now.

18
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:41,887
When you grow many orchids, it is inevitable that orchids will rot.

19
00:06:43,887 --> 00:06:51,885
If it accidentally rots, you need to immediately cut off the rotten part.

20
00:06:51,885 --> 00:06:59,884
Then isolate the rotten orchid pot from other normal orchid pots.

21
00:07:02,883 --> 00:07:10,882
This helps prevent rot from spreading to normal orchids.

22
00:07:36,877 --> 00:07:42,875
Then cut off all damaged roots.

23
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:07,870
This is charcoal

24
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:36,898
and grind into powder.

25
00:09:02,893 --> 00:09:10,891
Then sprinkle activated charcoal powder on the newly cut wound.

26
00:09:12,891 --> 00:09:20,889
Helps cuts heal faster and eliminates fungal diseases.

27
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:29,887
Because activated carbon has a very good disinfection function.

28
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:39,885
Then you sprinkle more on the orchid root.

29
00:09:52,883 --> 00:10:00,881
Then place the orchid pot in a cool place and do not water for 1 week and the orchid will recover.

30
00:10:00,881 --> 00:10:02,881
Next way.

31
00:10:04,881 --> 00:10:12,879
Mix 3 tablespoons of activated carbon with 2 liters of water.

32
00:10:47,872 --> 00:10:55,870
Then use this water to water the orchid roots.

33
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:06,868
Do this periodically every 2 weeks for normal orchids.

34
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:16,900
Helps prevent disease and improve pH in growing media.

35
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:26,898
Activated carbon also contains high levels of calcium and natural minerals that are very good for orchids.

36
00:11:26,898 --> 00:11:30,897
Helps stimulate rooting.

37
00:11:33,896 --> 00:11:41,895
Soak the orchid pot in this water for 20 minutes.

38
00:11:44,894 --> 00:11:52,892
After 20 minutes, take out the orchid pot.

39
00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:20,887
Then filter to get clear water.

40
00:12:41,883 --> 00:12:50,881
Next method: Use this water to thoroughly wipe the top and bottom of the leaves

41
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:02,879
The orchid will be protected from fungi and insects.

42
00:13:07,878 --> 00:13:16,876
The calcium content in activated carbon helps make leaves strong.

43
00:13:42,871 --> 00:13:52,869
Do this regularly every 2 weeks and you will be as healthy as this.

44
00:14:18,897 --> 00:14:26,895
Next method: You can also use this water to spray the entire orchid plant.

45
00:14:32,894 --> 00:14:40,892
Helps eliminate fungi and insects on leaves very well.

46
00:14:44,892 --> 00:14:52,890
and it also provides some nutrients through its leaves and roots very effectively

47
00:15:13,886 --> 00:15:16,885
Now let's see the results.

48
00:15:16,885 --> 00:15:23,884
Many new roots grow.

49
00:15:30,883 --> 00:15:40,881
Helps orchids absorb nutrients best.

50
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:55,878
The potassium and phosphorus content in activated carbon stimulates plants to root extremely quickly.

51
00:16:11,874 --> 00:16:19,873
Many flower buds grow on the same tree.

52
00:16:22,872 --> 00:16:30,871
The potassium content in charcoal helps prevent flower buds from falling off

53
00:16:43,868 --> 00:16:49,900
The flowers are brighter and stronger.

54
00:17:23,893 --> 00:17:30,892
Surely you will be surprised with this type of fertilizer.

55
00:17:34,891 --> 00:17:40,890
If you find it interesting, please like and share it with many people.
