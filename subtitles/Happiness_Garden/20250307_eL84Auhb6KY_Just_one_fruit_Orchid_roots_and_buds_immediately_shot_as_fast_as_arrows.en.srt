minutes after 20 minutes take out the

585
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:28,160
Orchid pot and place it in a place with

586
00:56:25,319 --> 00:56:30,480
lots of scattered sunlight so that the

587
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:32,140
Orchid can photosynthesize and exchange

588
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:36,409
nutrients

590
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:48,599
well please join us to see if the tree

591
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:48,599
is growing well

592
00:56:50,340 --> 00:57:01,080
[Music]

593
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:04,179
after only 3 weeks many new Roots have

594
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:04,179
[Music]

595
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:13,319
grown new Roots help the plant absorb

596
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:15,480
water and necessary nutrients from the

597
00:57:13,319 --> 00:57:17,079
environment this is very important for

598
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:20,680
plant growth especially during the

599
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:20,680
flowering stage

600
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:38,599
Roots help keep the tree standing

601
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:41,079
creating stability and reducing the risk

602
00:57:38,599 --> 00:57:45,160
of falling especially in strong wind

603
00:57:41,079 --> 00:57:49,050
environments or when the tree is tall

[Music]

605
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:02,640
the growth of new Roots often stimulates

606
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:05,480
the growth of other parts of the plant

607
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:09,559
including leaves and flowers the plant

608
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:09,559
will have enough energy to grow and

610
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:29,319
flower although roots are not directly

611
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:31,520
involved in photosynthesis they provide

612
00:58:29,319 --> 00:58:34,410
water and nutrients to leaves where

613
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:37,550
photosynthesis takes

615
00:58:54,359 --> 00:58:59,000
place uh newly velop Roots often signal

616
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,559
that the plant is in healthy condition

617
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,240
creating favorable conditions for

618
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:03,240
flowering and

[Music]

621
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:19,720
blooming Roots also participate in the

622
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:22,359
plants respiration process helping to

623
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:26,440
provide oxygen to cells this is very

624
00:59:22,359 --> 00:59:26,440
important for the life of the tree

625
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:38,920
Orchids with strong roots will produce

626
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,920
many

627
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:50,480
buds this Orchid of mine produces a lot

628
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:50,480
of buds

630
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:00,520
when the flowers bloom they are bright

631
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:04,480
and plump the flowers stay on the

632
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:04,480
