00:00:22,596 --> 00:00:25,895
Welcome to my channel

2
00:00:27,883 --> 00:00:34,860
To help spread more buds

3
00:00:56,889 --> 00:01:06,887
The flowers bloom profusely and hang on the branches for a long time before fading

4
00:01:21,754 --> 00:01:30,749
Water orchids twice a month like this

5
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:51,545
This helps the orchid have enough warmth to absorb nutrients better

6
00:01:56,127 --> 00:02:06,109
When orchids have enough moisture, they will bloom for a long time

7
00:02:12,308 --> 00:02:22,306
After soaking in water for about 10 minutes, take out the orchid pot

8
00:02:46,241 --> 00:02:56,266
Take 2 cloves of garlic and slice thinly

9
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:22,694
Add 1 liter of water

10
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:39,524
Add 1 teaspoon of honey

11
00:03:46,696 --> 00:03:56,687
Garlic combined with honey has very good antibacterial and antiseptic properties, helping to kill fungi in orchid substrates.

12
00:04:03,586 --> 00:04:10,584
Leave for 1 hour for nutrients to completely dissolve in water

13
00:04:13,703 --> 00:04:20,682
If you have a weak orchid and it is not blooming

14
00:04:27,045 --> 00:04:36,012
We need to remove damaged leaves and roots and replant

15
00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:15,322
After 1 hour, filter this water

16
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:43,432
Wiping the top and bottom of leaves helps repel insects and prevent fungal and bacterial attacks

17
00:05:43,432 --> 00:05:51,897
Garlic contains strong acids and essential oils

18
00:05:51,897 --> 00:05:59,896
Can repel or kill insects harmful to orchids.

19
00:06:01,451 --> 00:06:09,427
Do this periodically every 2 weeks with other orchids.

20
00:06:09,427 --> 00:06:18,607
This way adds nutrients and kills insects on orchid leaves

21
00:06:33,338 --> 00:06:41,321
Soak orchid roots in garlic and honey water for 10 minutes

22
00:06:41,321 --> 00:06:48,940
 
Helps disinfect and stimulate new root growth

23
00:06:56,802 --> 00:07:02,783
Water your orchid with this water

24
00:07:03,883 --> 00:07:13,881
Provides amino acids, vitamins and minerals for orchids, helping orchids grow well.

25
00:07:15,881 --> 00:07:25,446
Garlic combined with honey has very good antibacterial and antiseptic effects, helping to kill fungi in orchid substrates.

26
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:36,010
Promotes the growth and recovery of new root systems for orchids.

27
00:07:45,342 --> 00:07:55,340
Pour honey garlic water into the vase. You can also spray the orchids.

28
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:12,603
Helps wash away dirt and insects on orchids and disinfect the entire plant.

29
00:08:13,603 --> 00:08:22,601
You should apply this method every 2 weeks to your plants

30
00:08:46,936 --> 00:08:56,927
Soak for about 10 minutes, then take it out and plant it in a new pot to spread new roots

31
00:08:57,927 --> 00:09:06,626
Soaking in this water will cause it to grow new roots very quickly

32
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:16,390
I used the method of soaking the roots in garlic and honey water for this orchid

33
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:24,958
Orchids take root very quickly, so wilted leaves are quickly restored

34
00:09:30,346 --> 00:09:39,319
And this orchid also produces many beautiful flowers

35
00:09:43,885 --> 00:09:51,883
After soaking for 10 minutes, when the roots have absorbed enough nutrients, take out the orchid pot

36
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:08,213
When you take care of orchid leaves regularly, the leaves will be bright green and shiny

37
00:10:11,293 --> 00:10:19,278
Flowers will bloom more brightly than usual

38
00:10:22,751 --> 00:10:30,742
Many flowers can bloom on the same branch

39
00:10:32,742 --> 00:10:40,740
and the flowers stay on the branches for a long time before fading

40
00:10:42,765 --> 00:10:50,738
Hopefully the video will help you a lot in taking care of orchids at home

41
00:10:50,738 --> 00:10:59,870
