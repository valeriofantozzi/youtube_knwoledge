Hello friends

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,866
In this video, I share how to take care of orchids to help them grow and flower

3
00:00:10,056 --> 00:00:13,031
You see my orchids

4
00:00:14,094 --> 00:00:24,062
New flowers always grow after the old ones fall

5
00:00:25,062 --> 00:00:33,398
so my orchids bloom all year round

6
00:00:34,405 --> 00:00:39,393
bloom from branch to branch

7
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:46,291
flowers bloom on long branches

8
00:00:52,657 --> 00:00:59,655
Flowers can be kept on branches for up to 6 months

9
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:10,720
Many flowers grow on the same tree

10
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:28,431
New roots grow a lot to help absorb nutrients best

11
00:01:32,428 --> 00:01:37,784
chubby flower buds

12
00:01:47,242 --> 00:01:52,212
Help flowers bloom long on branches

13
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:06,076
brilliant flowers

14
00:02:08,675 --> 00:02:12,008
How to make fertilizer as follows:

15
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:16,912
Use 1 small carrot weighing about 30g

16
00:02:21,734 --> 00:02:24,705
Cut into small pieces

17
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:45,661
Add 1 liter of filtered water

18
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,065
Puree

19
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:12,896
filter out residue

20
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:45,390
Add 1 liter of filtered water

21
00:03:47,314 --> 00:03:49,314
How to use

22
00:03:50,988 --> 00:03:55,987
Use a cotton ball to soak up carrot juice

23
00:03:57,787 --> 00:04:02,786
Wipe both the top and bottom of the leaves

24
00:04:09,222 --> 00:04:13,217
help get rid of insects

25
00:04:13,217 --> 00:04:17,480
and open stomata

26
00:04:23,418 --> 00:04:29,408
Orchid will have better photosynthesis and metabolism

27
00:04:33,742 --> 00:04:40,227
At the same time, orchids also absorb some nutrients through the leaves

28
00:04:45,288 --> 00:04:50,277
Help keep the leaves green

29
00:05:02,008 --> 00:05:07,755
It is recommended to do this 1-2 times per month

30
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:45,673
2nd way

31
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,883
Water this carrot for orchids

32
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:58,963
Carrot juice is a good source of nutrients for orchids,

33
00:05:59,662 --> 00:06:06,437
including vitamins and minerals like beta-carotene, potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus.

34
00:06:07,413 --> 00:06:11,394
When the carrot juice is poured into the orchid pot,

35
00:06:11,394 --> 00:06:15,393
it provides nutrients to the orchids and helps to promote their health.

36
00:06:17,703 --> 00:06:23,692
In addition, carrot juice is also acidic, which helps regulate the pH of the potted soil

37
00:06:23,692 --> 00:06:28,531
and enhances the orchid's ability to absorb nutrients.

38
00:06:30,218 --> 00:06:38,428
You can soak the orchid pot in this carrot juice for 20 minutes

39
00:06:39,685 --> 00:06:44,654
Do this 1-2 times a month

40
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:52,551
3rd way

41
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,232
mist moisturizing carrot juice for orchids

42
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:21,747
Spray both the top and bottom of the leaves

43
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:27,979
help wash away dirt, wash away insects on orchids

44
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:33,178
Nutrients in carrot juice help orchids thrive and bloom

45
00:07:33,178 --> 00:07:38,144
However, be careful not to over-water the carrot juice as it can clog the water lines in the orchid.

46
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:44,576
Do not water the flowers because the flowers fall off quickly

47
00:07:47,727 --> 00:07:52,708
Hope the video content will help you in caring for orchids at home to bloom easily
