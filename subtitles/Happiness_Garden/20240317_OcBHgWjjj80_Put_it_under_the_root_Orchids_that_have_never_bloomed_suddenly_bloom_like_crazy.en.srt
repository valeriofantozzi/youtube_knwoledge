Hello friends!

2
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:29,895
When your orchids have finished blooming or your orchids have never bloomed

3
00:00:32,894 --> 00:00:42,992
First you need to cut off all wilted flower branches, leaves, and damaged roots.

4
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:56,956
This helps eliminate pathogens and stimulates the growth of new flowers, leaves and roots

5
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:48,879
Next I use eggshells as fertilizer to stimulate flowering

6
00:01:57,877 --> 00:02:06,875
Crush about 5 eggshells

7
00:02:39,342 --> 00:02:49,367
Then add 50ml of vinegar water to help ferment and dissolve the organic calcium

8
00:02:56,066 --> 00:03:06,897
The reaction between vinegar water and eggshell creates organic calcium that dissolves very quickly

9
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:26,060
Leave for 1 day to completely dissolve the calcium and minerals in the eggshell

10
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:39,790
1 Day Later

11
00:04:15,883 --> 00:04:23,882
Step 1: Water the roots every 2 weeks

12
00:04:30,315 --> 00:04:40,312
Eggshells contain a lot of calcium to help plants stay healthy and increase their resistance to pests

13
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:57,742
Eggshells also contain a lot of potassium which helps stimulate flower growth

14
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:16,871
Nitrogen and phosphorus in eggshells help leaves and roots grow very well

15
00:05:39,574 --> 00:05:46,898
Step 2: Spray this water on the leaves every 2 weeks

16
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:09,894
Vinegar helps remove dirt, insects, and fungal diseases on orchids

17
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:36,889
Helps orchids photosynthesize light and grow better

18
00:06:40,888 --> 00:06:43,887
2 Months Later

19
00:06:47,352 --> 00:06:56,318
The orchid has continued to bloom many buds

20
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:20,047

00:08:00,486 --> 00:08:08,470
Next, I share how to quickly restore rotten orchids

22
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:38,964
If you have an orchid that has rot causing it to lose all its leaves.

23
00:08:38,964 --> 00:08:46,963
So don't rush to throw it away. I'll share how to revive it quickly and easily.

24
00:08:51,962 --> 00:09:01,960
This orchid has a bacterial disease that causes it to rot.

25
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:10,958
First, cut off and clean the rotten areas.

26
00:09:28,954 --> 00:09:38,886
Then completely cut off the damaged roots.

27
00:10:22,877 --> 00:10:30,576
And this is hydrogen peroxide.

28
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:40,574
Place pure hydrogen peroxide on the rotten area.

29
00:10:46,572 --> 00:10:59,570
Helps eliminate pathogens and prevent rot from spreading.

30
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:14,600
and you pour it on the cut to help disinfect it.

31
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:32,663
Then leave it for 1 day without irrigation to let the wound heal completely.

32
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:46,661
Take 3 liters of water.

33
00:11:52,659 --> 00:12:02,657
Take 1 teaspoon of baking soda and mix it with water.

34
00:12:12,655 --> 00:12:22,653
Baking soda helps eliminate pathogens and needs to balance pH levels.

35
00:12:33,651 --> 00:12:43,649
Soak the entire orchid in this water for 10 minutes.

36
00:12:51,648 --> 00:13:01,646
will eliminate pathogens and need to balance the PH level in the orchid growing environment.

37
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:36,639
Then take it out.

38
00:13:48,636 --> 00:13:54,635
Pour water into the plate.

39
00:13:55,635 --> 00:14:05,666
helps the substrate always have the right moisture for orchids to germinate.

40
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:19,664
Place in a cool, well-lit place.

41
00:14:26,662 --> 00:14:36,660
Spray moisturizer regularly when the substrate feels dry.

42
00:14:51,657 --> 00:15:00,655
Take 2 spoons of rice.

43
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:12,653
Rice water contains many nutrients that are very good for the growth of orchids.

44
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:40,648
Soak orchid roots in rice water for 20 minutes.

45
00:15:42,647 --> 00:15:52,645
Helps stimulate the growth of sprouts and roots

46
00:15:55,645 --> 00:16:01,643
Do it once a week.

47
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:26,638
After soaking for 20 minutes, take it out.

48
00:16:46,634 --> 00:16:50,667
1 MONTH LATER.

49
00:16:56,666 --> 00:17:06,664
From the rotten orchid root, a small healthy orchid is revived.

50
00:17:36,658 --> 00:17:46,656
Continue watering the orchid with rice water once a week.

51
00:17:50,655 --> 00:17:59,653
Soak for 20 minutes then take out.

52
00:18:28,648 --> 00:18:32,647
After the next 1 month.

53
00:18:39,645 --> 00:18:46,644
Baby orchids are getting healthier and stronger.

54
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:16,638
Orchid roots also grow very healthily.

55
00:19:22,637 --> 00:19:32,635
Hopefully the video will help you a lot in recovering rotten orchids.
