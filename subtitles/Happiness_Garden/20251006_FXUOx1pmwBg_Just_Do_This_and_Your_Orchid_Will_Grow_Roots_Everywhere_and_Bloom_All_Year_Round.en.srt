To make this compost, you will need

229
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,920
eggs. More precisely, about 10

230
00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:14,000
eggshells.

236
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,600
Then wash the eggshells with water to

237
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,810
remove remaining egg white, keeping the

238
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:42,569

241
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,400
Next, place the eggshells under the sun

242
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,320
to dry completely. This step makes them

243
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,919
more brittle and easier to crush. And

244
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,480
the sunlight also helps naturally

245
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,480
disinfect them.

247
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,000
after about 3 hours of sun drying, the

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,520
eggshells are completely dry and ready

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,600
for the next step.

250
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,240
Now, just crush them first and then

251
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,160
grind them finely. The finer the shells,

252
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,540
the easier it will be for the plant to

253
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:42,900
absorb the nutrients and grow better.

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,280
teaspoon of the eggshell powder and put

260
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,960
it into to a clean bottle. This will be

261
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,090
the main ingredient for making the

262
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,880
watering solution for the orchids.

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,039
clean bottle, pour in about 4 cups of

266
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,679
boiling water, equivalent to one liter

267
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,200
of water. Stir well so that the

268
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,679
nutrients in the eggshells are

269
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,679
completely dissolved.

tightly and let it sit until the

273
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,640
solution cools completely. This step

274
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:13,080
helps the minerals in the eggshells

275
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,080
blend into the water more effectively.

[Music]

277
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,960
When the water has completely cooled,

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,039
strain out the eggshell residue and keep

279
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,039
the clear liquid. This is the calcium

280
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,980
and mineralrich solution to water your

281
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:50,270

[Music]

283
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,080
The first method is to use a soft cloth

284
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,240
soaked in this solution.

285
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,100
Then gently wipe both the upper and

286
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,790
lower surfaces of the leaves.

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,679
Eggshells contain a lot of calcium, an

289
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,760
important mineral for orchid growth.

290
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,280
Calcium helps form new tissues, makes

291
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,760
the leaves thicker and stronger than

292
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,760
usual, and also supports strong root

293
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,760
development.

[Music]

295
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,919
This method not only provides nutrients

296
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,159
but also helps kill fungi and repel

297
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:31,720
insects effectively, keeping the plant

298
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,720
healthy and disease-free.

299
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,559
You can wipe the leaves every 2 weeks to

300
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,039
remove dust, helping them

301
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,960
photosynthesize better. When the leaves

302
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:47,360
are clean and clear, the plant will

303
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:52,200
absorb light more effectively, grow

304
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,200
stronger roots, and produce more blooms.

[Music]

306
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,799
Another tip is to wipe the leaves early

307
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,360
in the morning or late in the afternoon

308
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:05,440
when the sun is not too strong. This

309
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,360
allows the leaves to dry naturally,

310
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:11,799
preventing water from lingering and

311
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,799
causing rot or fungal issues.

313
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,159
The second method is to pour this

314
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,559
mixture into a spray bottle. Then gently

315
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,640
mist the entire plant covering both the

316
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,640
upper and lower sides of the leaves so

317
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,140
the plant can absorb the nutrients more

318
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:42,720
evenly.

[Music]

320
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,559
You should mist in the early morning or

321
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:49,840
late afternoon when the sunlight is not

322
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:52,000
too harsh. This allows the leaves to dry

323
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,000
during the day, reduces the risk of

324
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,200
fungal diseases, and helps the plant

325
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,200
absorb nutrients to the fullest.

326
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,520
Maintain misting with this eggshell

327
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,440
mixture every 2 weeks. After just a few

328
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,840
weeks, you will see the leaves become

329
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,100
darker green, glossy, and healthy, and

330
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:15,180
the roots grow strong.

332
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:21,440
After spraying the entire plant, let it

333
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,280
air dry. This spraying method not only

334
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,400
provides nutrients, but also keeps the

335
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,400
leaves clean and healthy.

337
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,190
The third method is to water each orchid

338
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,480
pot directly with this mixture.

340
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,960
Gently pour around the base and onto the

341
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:49,120
growing medium. This helps the roots

342
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,880
absorb calcium and essential minerals,

343
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,480
nourishing the plant from within and

344
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,700
preparing it well for upcoming shoots

345
00:23:52,480 --> 00:24:02,829

347
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,400
The calcium from the eggshell water

348
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,000
helps enhance orchid root growth while

349
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,480
improving the ability to absorb

350
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,480
nutrients from the growing medium. As a

351
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,910
result, the plant will grow stronger and

352
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:29,160
healthier.

[Music]

354
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,039
Calcium also helps orchids increase

355
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,799
disease resistance, making the plant

356
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:37,600
less prone to infections and health

357
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,600
problems. As a result, the flowers will

358
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:43,159
retain their color and stay vibrant for

359
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,159
a longer time.

this mixture about once every 2 weeks.

363
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,559
This simple habit ensures the roots and

364
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,039
leaves receive enough calcium and

365
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:03,279
minerals, helping the plant grow healthy

366
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:06,279
with glossy green leaves and more even

367
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,279

Uh after applying this watering method

369
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,279
for some time, you will see strong

370
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:21,000
roots, glossy green leaves, and better

371
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:21,000
orchid flower development.

372
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,000
The fourth method is to sprinkle the

373
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,880
eggshell powder directly onto the

374
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,880
surface of the orchid pot.

375
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,440

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,600
retention and irerration for the plant.

380
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,760
Sprinkle a moderate amount around the

381
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,640
pot surface, maintaining it regularly

382
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,960
every 2 to 3 weeks. This method helps

383
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,279
orchid roots grow strong, keeps the

384
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,279
growing medium loose, and ensures the

385
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,200
plant stays healthy. When applied

386
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,120
consistently, you will see the orchids

387
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,440
thriving and ready for new shoots and

388
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,440
flower buds.

390
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,600
And here are the results after 1 month

391
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,000
of care. You can see the orchid has

392
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,760
developed many new roots. This helps the

393
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
plant absorb nutrients more effectively,

394
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:31,880
allowing it to thrive with glossy green

395
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,880
leaves and vibrant blooms.

396
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,640
These new roots not only help the plant

397
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,720
absorb nutrients better, but also create

398
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,960
a strong foundation for long-term

399
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,279
growth. When the roots are healthy, both

400
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,520
the leaves and flowers of the orchid are

401
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:55,320
optimally nourished, ready for the

402
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,320
upcoming blooming seasons.

404
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,520
Um, with proper care, the petals bloom

405
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,520
soft, fresh, and stay on the stem

406
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,039
longer. This allows you to enjoy the

407
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,520
vibrant beauty of the orchids for an

408
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,520
extended time.

409
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,279
When consistently applying these care

410
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,880
methods, many flowers can bloom at the

411
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,960
same time while maintaining their

412
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,000
vitality, preventing the orchids from

413
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:40,360
wilting quickly. The orchids will always

414
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,360
be vibrant and full of life.

415
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,039
These fresh flowers not only beautify

416
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,520
the space, but also demonstrate the

417
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,520
plant's strong vitality. Each bloom is

418
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,760
healthy, brightly colored, and lasts

419
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,919
longer thanks to proper care, combined

420
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:59,480
with nutrients from the roots, leaves,

421
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,480
and growing medium.
