00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 
Hello friends

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,999
I'm so glad you came to my channel

3
00:00:06,181 --> 00:00:16,897
If you have an orchid, and you want it to bloom as much as these orchids of mine

4
00:00:20,463 --> 00:00:30,428
Please watch to the end of the video

5
00:00:32,427 --> 00:00:40,826
Now I will show you what is the best fertilizer for orchids.

6
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:46,625
It will help the orchid grow from the roots and leaves and will bloom a lot

7
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:53,320
Let's start

8
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,423
These are cooked soybeans

9
00:00:59,422 --> 00:01:06,887
Take 1 handful of cooked soybeans

10
00:01:08,887 --> 00:01:17,885
Soybeans contain many important minerals such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium that are good for orchid growth

11
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:28,883
Add 2 tablespoons of brown sugar

12
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:52,178
Add 50ml beer

13
00:02:13,874 --> 00:02:20,873
Add 10ml vinegar

14
00:02:29,054 --> 00:02:36,036
500ml warm water

15
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:58,598
Leave for 1 week to ferment naturally before using

16
00:03:07,742 --> 00:03:10,896
1 Week Later

17
00:03:20,894 --> 00:03:26,893
Take 300ml

18
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:55,887
add 3 Liters of water

19
00:04:11,617 --> 00:04:25,657
Put this organic fertilizer in a spray bottle

20
00:04:31,892 --> 00:04:42,966
Spray the top and bottom of the leaves thoroughly

21
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:56,408
When provided with this organic nutrition, orchids will grow very well

22
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:08,873
Helps leaves stay green and strong

23
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:20,950
Fertilizing once every 2 weeks will be very good for orchids

24
00:05:23,701 --> 00:05:28,669
Use this organic fertilizer to water the orchid pot

25
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:37,034
The potassium and phosphorus content will promote the growth of roots and flowers very quickly

26
00:05:37,145 --> 00:05:47,132
And the nitrogen in this organic fertilizer will help keep the leaves big and green

27
00:05:48,427 --> 00:05:52,840
Apply once every 2 weeks

28
00:05:55,274 --> 00:06:01,158
You can soak the orchid pot in this organic fertilizer for 20 minutes,

29
00:06:01,158 --> 00:06:07,145
so that the roots can absorb the most nutrients.

30
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:10,498
Results after 1 month

31
00:06:10,998 --> 00:06:15,667
Many new roots grow

32
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:24,924
New roots help orchids absorb water and nutrients better

33
00:06:24,924 --> 00:06:37,816
When we provide nutrients, the roots will immediately absorb and transport to the entire orchid plant

34
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:50,762
if you fertilize once every 2 weeks in combination with other organic fertilizers that I have shared

35
00:06:50,762 --> 00:06:58,181
I guarantee the orchid will always grow well and always bloom with lots of flowers

36
00:07:02,152 --> 00:07:11,148
Potassium in soybeans and brown sugar helps orchids bloom many flowers on the same branch

37
00:07:13,145 --> 00:07:23,870
Potassium and brown sugar also help fight drought very well

38
00:07:25,735 --> 00:07:35,710
Potassium helps carry water from the roots to the highest and farthest parts of the orchid such as the tops and buds

39
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:42,329
so the buds don't wilt due to lack of water

40
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:52,640
so the flower will keep on the branch for a long time without wilting

41
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,206
Flowers can bloom up to 6 months without falling

42
00:07:57,206 --> 00:08:02,005
Hope it will be of great help to you

43
00:08:05,278 --> 00:08:13,869
Next, I share how to help rotten orchids recover quickly

44
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:20,868
and shoot many baby orchids at the same time.

45
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:29,900
Helps orchids shoot many plants at the same time in the same pot.

46
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,899
and blooms a lot of flowers.

47
00:08:36,898 --> 00:08:43,897
An orchid has rot disease.

48
00:08:44,897 --> 00:08:53,895
The cause of the disease is fungi and bacteria that cause leaf rot.

49
00:09:03,893 --> 00:09:12,891
If rot is not treated promptly, it will spread and cause the orchid to die.

50
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:28,888
I need to check the roots.

51
00:09:30,887 --> 00:09:40,885
Then cut off all damaged roots.

52
00:09:53,883 --> 00:09:59,882
Then rinse with water.

53
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:15,879
Take 2 liters of water.

54
00:10:23,877 --> 00:10:33,875
Add 5 vitamin B1 tablets.

55
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:42,873
Vitamin B1 helps stimulate rooting and germination very quickly.

56
00:10:47,872 --> 00:10:57,870
Take 1 aloe vera leaf and cut it into thin slices.

57
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:10,868
Soak aloe vera in Vitamin B1 water.

58
00:11:10,868 --> 00:11:19,899
and wait 10 minutes for the nutrients to completely dissolve in the water.

59
00:11:25,898 --> 00:11:35,896
Then filter this water.

60
00:11:46,894 --> 00:11:55,892
Soak the orchid branches in this water for 20 minutes.

61
00:11:55,892 --> 00:12:02,891
Helps stimulate the growth of roots and sprouts very quickly.

62
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:18,887
Using a pine bark growing medium helps maintain moisture and proper drainage.

63
00:12:35,884 --> 00:12:46,882
Add moss on top.

64
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:06,878
Take a cotton ball and soak it in this water.

65
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:26,874
Then incubate the orchid roots.

66
00:13:30,873 --> 00:13:38,872
Incubate for a day then take out. This helps stimulate rapid root and sprout growth.

67
00:13:51,869 --> 00:14:00,867
From now on spray this water on the leaves once a week.

68
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:12,898
and water the roots with this water once a week.

69
00:14:18,897 --> 00:14:24,896
Place in a cool, well-lit place for 1 day.

70
00:14:32,894 --> 00:14:39,893
After 1 day, remove the cotton from the orchid roots.

71
00:14:49,891 --> 00:14:58,889
Take the transparent plastic box and snap it up.

72
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:05,888
and place it in a cool, well-lit place.

73
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:18,885
Spray aloe vera water and B1 once a week.

74
00:15:21,885 --> 00:15:31,883
Water aloe vera and B1 once a week.

75
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:50,879
1 MONTH LATER.

76
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:10,875
The orchid has grown two sprouts on both sides.

77
00:16:24,872 --> 00:16:33,870
Continue spraying aloe vera water and B1 once a week.

78
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:46,868
and Continue watering aloe vera and B1 once a week

79
00:17:05,897 --> 00:17:08,897
AFTER NEXT 1 MONTH.

80
00:17:13,896 --> 00:17:23,894
 
The 2 shoots are growing healthily but have not yet taken root.

81
00:17:32,892 --> 00:17:42,890
Continue watering aloe vera and B1 once a week.

82
00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:55,887
And continue to spray aloe vera water and B1 once a week.

83
00:18:18,883 --> 00:18:21,882
After the next 2 months.

84
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:36,879
The orchid has developed healthy roots, stems, and leaves.

85
00:18:41,878 --> 00:18:51,876
and has developed more buds (flower branches)

86
00:18:51,876 --> 00:18:59,875
Thank you for watching the video. Good luck and see you in the next videos!
