00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,320
Welcome to my garden. Today I continue

3
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,719
to share how to make natural fertilizer

4
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,360
for orchids using readily available and

5
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,320
inexpensive ingredients that are highly

6
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,399
effective.

7
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,199
To make today's natural fertilizer, I

8
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,280
need one aloe vera leaf. Then I cut the

9
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,879
aloe vera leaf into thin slices to

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,879
easily extract the nutrients from

11
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,400
inside. Uh please comment and let me

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,040
know which country you're watching the

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,640
video from. It's amazing that we can

14
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,640
chat together from all around the

15
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,560
world. Next, I place the sliced aloe

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,520
vera into one liter of clean water to

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,520
soak. Soaking the aloe vera in water

18
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,920
allows natural nutrients like vitamins

19
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,680
and enzymes to be released, creating a

20
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,000
nourishing solution that is very

21
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,079
beneficial for

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,240
orchids. Then I cover the container and

23
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,960
let the mixture sit for a few hours so

24
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,560
the aloe vera can naturally release its

25
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,200
nutrients. Next, I place the sliced aloe

26
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,079
vera into one liter of clean water to

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,079
soak. Soaking the aloe vera in water

28
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,560
allows natural nutrients like vitamins

29
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,320
and enzymes to be released, creating a

30
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,960
nourishing solution that is very

31
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,960
beneficial for orchids.

32
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,120
Next, I prepare.5 L of clean water to

33
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,120
dissolve the vitamin

34
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,080
B1. Dissolving the vitamin B1 separately

35
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,319
helps it dissolve better before mixing

36
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,239
with the aloe vera water, ensuring that

37
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,239
the orchid can absorb the maximum

38
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,239
nutrients.

support me and not miss any orchid care

43
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,879
tips. It's wonderful to have you as a

44
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:54,720
companion. Then I strain the mixture

45
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,640
through a sie to remove the residue of

46
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,360
the vitamin B1, keeping only the

47
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,360
nutrient-rich liquid.

48
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,360
This ensures that the nourishing

49
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,680
solution doesn't have any residue,

50
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,680
residue, or blockages when watering the

51
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,239
orchids, allowing the plants to easily

52
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,239
absorb the

53
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,920
nutrients. Step one, I use a soft cloth

54
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,440
to soak up the B1 solution and gently

55
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,840
wipe both the top and bottom of the

56
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,840
orchid leaves.

57
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,799
This helps the plant absorb nutrients

58
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,400
directly through the leaves while also

59
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,840
cleaning off dirt and bacteria,

60
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,840
supporting the orchid's healthy growth.

61
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,150
[Music]

62
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,319
Wiping the leaves helps the orchid

63
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,040
maintain good health throughout the

64
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,959
blooming period as vitamin B1 provides

65
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,920
the necessary nutrients for the leaves

66
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,920
and other parts of the plant.

67
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,400
When the orchid is blooming, the leaves

68
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,759
can easily accumulate dust or water

69
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,680
spots. Wiping the leaves clean helps

70
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,360
keep the plant fresh and ensures that

71
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,650
dirt doesn't block the photosynthesis

72
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,730
process.

[Music]

75
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,360
This method also helps reduce the risk

76
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,280
of orchids getting sick during the

77
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,320
blooming period, keeping the flowers

78
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,320
fresh for a longer

79
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,160
time. Clean orchid leaves will make it

80
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,840
easier to maintain good humidity,

81
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,360
helping the plant avoid dehydration

82
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,360
while focusing its energy on blooming.

83
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,720
Clean and shiny orchid leaves not only

84
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,960
help the plant stay healthier, but also

85
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:35,280
enhance the beauty of the flowers,

86
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,280
creating harmony for the entire

87
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:42,080
orchid. In fact, you only need to do

88
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,520
this one to two times a month to help

89
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,520
the plant maintain good health.

90
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,199
Step two, pour the B1 water into a spray

91
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,600
bottle. Then evenly spray it onto the

92
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,600
orchid

93
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,280
plant. When spraying B1 water onto the

94
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,000
plant, remember to spray both the top

95
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,479
and bottom of the leaves. This helps the

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,800
plant absorb nutrients more easily,

97
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,560
stimulates root growth, and supports the

98
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,560
plant's health throughout the blooming

99
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,560
process.

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,240
You can also spray it onto the roots and

101
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,240
base to boost the vitality of your

102
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,800
orchid. The best time to spray B1 water

103
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,520
is in the early morning or during the

104
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,520
cooler evening hours.

105
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,759
This helps the plant absorb nutrients

106
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,160
easily without being damaged by the

107
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,160
intense

108
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,160
sunlight. Don't spray too much. Just a

109
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,039
fine mist is enough to prevent the plant

110
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,039
from becoming water logged.

111
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,080
However, make sure not to spray B1 water

112
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,080
onto the

113
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:56,560
flowers because wet flowers are more

114
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,560
likely to lose their

115
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:02,400
petals. Only spray the leaves, base, and

116
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,759
roots to ensure the plant grows healthy

117
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,759
without affecting the flowers.

118
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:21,319
Um, you can pour the remaining B1 water

119
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,319
into a cup to use for the next step.

120
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,040
Then I proceed to filter out the aloe

121
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,880
vera residue. The filtered aloe vera

122
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:56,120
water will be mixed with the water that

123
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,120
already contains dissolved vitamin B1.

[Music]

126
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,839
Step three, water each orchid pot with

127
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,839
the aloe vera and B1 mixture.

128
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,800
I use this mixture to water directly at

129
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,800
the base of each orchid

130
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,200
pot. Each pot only needs to be watered

131
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,480
with just enough to keep the soil or

132
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,480
growing medium slightly moist.

133
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,640
This mixture will help the plant recover

134
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:16,360
quickly, grow strong roots, and be ready

135
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,360
for the next growth cycle.

136
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,800
[Music]

137
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,320
This mixture provides essential

138
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,000
nutrients, helping the orchid stay

139
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,680
healthy and keeping the flowers fresh

140
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,680
and beautiful throughout the blooming

141
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:40,399
process. Uh, vitamin B1 will help the

142
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,240
plant develop strong roots, which in

143
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,240
turn allows the orchid to absorb

144
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,040
nutrients better and grow steadily

145
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,040
throughout the blooming process.

146
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,519
Aloe vera water has natural

147
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,360
antibacterial properties, helping the

148
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,720
plant defend against disease-causing

149
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,720
agents like mold and

150
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,279
bacteria. This mixture supports the

151
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,279
orchid after the flowers fade, helping

152
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:12,160
to restore its health and prepare for

153
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:16,410
the new growth cycle.

154
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,410
[Music]

155
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,000
Watering with this nourishing solution

156
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,600
helps keep the leaves healthy and clean,

157
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
thereby improving the photosynthesis

158
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,480
process and providing enough energy for

159
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,480
the plant's

160
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,920
growth. Watering with this mixture helps

161
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,000
reduce stress on the plant, especially

162
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,079
in in changing environmental conditions

163
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,079
or when the plant faces difficulties in

164
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,079
blooming.

165
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,120
To keep the orchid healthy and growing

166
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,760
well, you only need to do this one to

167
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,760
two times a

168
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,880
month. If the orchid is blooming and you

169
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,440
feel it's necessary, you can do it once

170
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,079
more during the month, but remember, not

171
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,079
more than three

172
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:09,200
times. After watering the orchid with

173
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,600
the mixture, soak the pot in the

174
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,480
solution for about 20 minutes. This

175
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,000
helps the plant absorb nutrients

176
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,320
optimally, promoting strong root and

177
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,320
leaf

178
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:30,160
growth. Step four, use a dry cloth to

179
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,839
wipe off any leftover liquid fertilizer

180
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,839
droplets from the spaces between the

181
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,839
leaves.

182
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,839
This will help prevent the fertilizer

183
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,920
from staying on the plant for too long,

184
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:45,720
which could cause the tips to rot or

185
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,720
affect the plant's growth.

186
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,880
Um, after wiping, the plant will dry

187
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,959
quickly and be ready for a new growth

188
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,519
cycle. Remember to be gentle to avoid

189
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,519
damaging the

190
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,639
plant. Um, standing water is an ideal

191
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,079
environment for mold and disease-causing

192
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:24,560
bacteria. Drying the plant helps protect

193
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:27,959
it from common issues like leaf rot and

194
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,959
crown rot.

195
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,680
Clean and dry leaves absorb light more

196
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,160
efficiently, which supports a smooth

197
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:46,440
photosynthesis process and helps the

198
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,440
plant grow strong and healthy.

199
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,279
When you wipe off the water, you have a

200
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,519
chance to closely inspect the leaves and

201
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,079
promptly detect any any unusual signs

202
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,079
such as disease spots, pests, or damaged

203
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,079
leaves.

204
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,920
After soaking for about 20 minutes,

205
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,040
gently take the orchid pot out and place

206
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,040
it in a spot with gentle

207
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,240
sunlight. Placing the plant in gentle

208
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,040
sunlight helps the orchid

209
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,279
photosynthesize better, keeps the leaves

210
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,959
green and healthy, and supports root

211
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,519
development as well as flower

212
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,519
nourishment.

213
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,160
Avoid placing the plant under direct

214
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,839
harsh sunlight as strong light can cause

215
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,839
the leaves to wilt or shock the

216
00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:00,880
plant. I hope today's video will be

217
