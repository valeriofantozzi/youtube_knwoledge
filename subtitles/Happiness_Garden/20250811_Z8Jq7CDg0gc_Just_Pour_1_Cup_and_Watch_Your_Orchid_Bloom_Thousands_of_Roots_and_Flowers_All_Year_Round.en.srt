If you want to care for orchids at home

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,960
so they stay healthy, produce plenty of

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,680

To start making the fertilizer, you just

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,920
need to take three tablespoons of rice.

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,600
A simple ingredient, but one that

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,600

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,600

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,920
Add one liter of water and wait about 10

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,320
minutes for the nutrients from the rice

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,160
to dissolve into the water, uh, creating

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,160

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,160

193
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,279
And here is the result. A healthy

194
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,519
orchid, lush green leaves, brilliantly

195
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,440
blooming flowers that last long, clearly

196
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,399
showing the care and love you have for

197
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,160
your garden.

198
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,160
Um, this mixture has helped the plant

199
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,560
grow healthily and stimulated root

200
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,959
development. A healthy root system

201
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,440
allows the orchid to easily absorb the

202
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,839
maximum essential nutrients for growth

203
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,839
and flowering.

204
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,320
You can easily notice that the roots of

205
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,959
these orchids grow very strong and

206
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:15,079
sturdy, playing an important role in the

207
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,079
overall development of the plant.

Potassium found in rice water and bell

peppers helps orchid flowers bloom

214
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,360
brilliantly and stay on the stem for a

215
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,880
long time before fading. In fact, the

216
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,120
petals can remain on the stem for up to

217
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,120
6 months, bringing lasting beauty to the

218
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,120
plant.
