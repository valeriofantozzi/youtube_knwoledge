00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,240
Welcome to my little orchid garden where

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,560
each flower tells a story of life and

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,000
the beauty of nature. I'm very happy to

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,320
accompany you in caring for these

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,320
wonderful orchids.

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,400
In today's video, I'll share how to

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,640
revive and care for both weak orchids

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,560
and those growing normally so they

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,880
become healthy, lush, and full of

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,160
vibrant blooms right in your garden or

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,680
on your small balcony.

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,520
Let's get started.

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,520
[Music]

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,719
First, prepare a container with one

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,559
liter of clean water. This will be the

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,559
base ingredient for making the natural

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,610
fertilizer that helps orchids recover

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:05,039
and grow strong.

[Music]

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,280
Next, you'll need some dry yeast used

28
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,280
for baking bread.

29
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:32,439

[Music]

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,079
Uh, just one teaspoon of dry yeast is

32
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,079
enough.

33
00:01:48,790 --> 00:02:01,139
[Music]

34
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,479
The final ingredient you need is a bit

35
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,319
of molasses. Simple as it is, this is a

36
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,239
great source of nutrients that feeds

37
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,800
beneficial microbes and supports your

38
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,660
orchid's healthy growth from roots to

39
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,720
leaves.

00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:21,640
[Music]

41
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,640
Just one teaspoon of molasses is enough.

42
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:40,239
[Music]

43
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,080
Then stir the mixture well so all the

44
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,080
ingredients dissolve completely in the

45
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,080
water.

[Music]

48
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,120
Cover the container and place the

49
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,800
mixture in a cool, well ventilated spot

50
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,440
for one day to allow natural

51
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,680
fermentation. This step helps activate

52
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,680
the beneficial microorganisms for your

53
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,680
orchids.

54
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,599
After blooming, orchids often enter a

55
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,680
weakened state with reduced resistance

56
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,760
as most of their energy has been used up

57
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,159
during the flowering process. This is

58
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,810
the time when the plant needs proper

59
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,400
recovery to continue growing.

60
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,080
[Music]

61
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,560
You need to remove any yellow leaves

62
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,959
right away as they no longer benefit the

63
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,400
plant. This also helps reduce the risk

64
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,239
of fungal infections and allows the

65
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,239
orchid to recover faster and more

66
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,239
strongly.

67
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,360
Next, trim off any dried or wilted

68
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,200
flower spikes. This prevents the plant

69
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,440
from wasting energy on parts that are no

70
00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:00,040
longer viable, allowing it to focus on

71
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,040
root recovery and new chute growth.

73
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,199
At the same time, remove any damaged,

74
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,600
rotting or brittle roots. This helps

75
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,680
prevent the spread of bacteria and

76
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,500
creates the right conditions for healthy

77
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,600
new roots to grow.

95
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,000
After one day of fermentation, we now

96
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,320
have a natural fertilizer full of

97
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,240
beneficial microbes. It's time to use

98
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,919
this mixture to care for orchids that

99
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,800
need recovery and give them a boost of

100
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:45,280
vitality.

101
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:49,639
I pour out 500 ml of the fermented

102
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,639
solution to dilute it before use.

103
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,759
The remaining fermented mixture can be

104
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,880
stored in a cool, wellventilated place

105
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,360
for future use. Be sure to keep the lid

106
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:03,639
tightly closed to preserve the quality

107
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,639
and effectiveness of the fertilizer.

108
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:12,240
Next, add 500 ml of clean water to the

109
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,080
500 ml of extracted solution. This 1:1

110
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,919
ratio makes the mixture gentler,

111
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,490
suitable for watering orchids without

112
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,569
the risk of shocking their roots.

113
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:21,569
[Music]

114
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,080
Method one, pour the diluted mixture

115
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,080
into a spray bottle to mist your

116
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,080
orchids.

117
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,280
Then you can spray it directly onto the

118
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,360
leaves, stems, and roots in the early

119
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,080
morning or late afternoon, allowing the

120
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,639
plant to absorb the nutrients easily and

121
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,639
recover quickly.

122
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,400
Wilted yellowing leaves can gradually

123
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,800
regain their green color when gently

124
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,560
nourished with this solution. Spraying

125
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,560
directly onto the leaves allows the

126
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,800
plant to absorb nutrients more quickly

127
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,800
and effectively.

128
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,360
The naturally fermented mixture contains

129
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,680
beneficial microorganisms that improve

130
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,520
the environment around the roots. When

131
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,160
sprayed on the plant, this solution

132
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,400
helps stimulate the growth of new roots,

133
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,680
the most crucial factor in reviving a

134
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,840
weakened orchid.

135
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,280
Uh the solution not only helps the plant

136
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,759
recover after blooming but also

137
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,160
regenerates energy throughout the stem,

138
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,599
roots and leaves. This prepares the

139
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,240
orchid for a new growth phase and the

140
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,240
next blooming cycle.

141
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,800
You only need to do this twice a month.

142
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,599
Regular care like this will help your

143
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,120
orchid gradually recover, grow stronger,

144
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,200
and be well prepared for its next

145
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:06,160
blooming.

147
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,199
Method two, pour the mixture directly

148
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,199
onto the roots and growing medium.

149
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,240
This method allows the nutrients to

150
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,560
penetrate deeply, nourishing the roots

151
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,080
from within and naturally restoring the

152
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,080
surrounding root environment

153
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,080
effectively.

154
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,479
When the solution is poured onto the

155
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,160
roots and growing medium, the

156
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,080
microorganisms and minerals in the

157
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,440
mixture gradually absorb into the root

158
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,000
zone, helping heal damaged areas and

159
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,519
stimulate new root growth. This is a

160
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,880
crucial step in helping the orchid

161
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,880
recover after a weakened phase.

162
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,800
After watering the roots with the

163
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,040
fertilizer, you can also soak the entire

164
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,440
orchid pot in the mixture for about 20

165
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,600
minutes. This helps the roots absorb

166
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,839
nutrients more effectively, softens the

167
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,560
growing medium, and naturally restores

168
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,560
moisture to the plant.

169
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,200
You can put the remaining mixture into a

170
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,519
spray bottle to care for other orchids

171
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,760
in your garden. This method saves

172
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,360
resources and provides consistent

173
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,360
benefits for your entire orchid

174
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,360
collection.

175
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,640
Spraying the mixture provides natural

176
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,920
nutrients, helping your orchids maintain

177
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,920
health and grow steadily everyday.

178
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,880
The fermented mixture stimulates the

179
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,200
microbial system in the soil and growing

180
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:43,800
medium, creating an ideal environment

181
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,800
for orchid roots to grow sustainably.

182
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,720
Regular care with this solution helps

183
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,640
boost the plant's resistance, enabling

184
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,680
orchids to fight off pests and withstand

185
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,680
unfavorable weather changes.

186
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,320
Spraying this mixture on blooming

187
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,120
orchids gently supplements nutrients,

188
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,920
prolongs the flowers time on the spike,

189
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,360
and keeps the petal colors vibrant. At

190
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,279
the same time, it prevents the plant

191
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,680
from becoming too exhausted during the

192
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,680
blooming process.

193
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,920
After soaking for about 20 minutes, use

194
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,519
a soft cloth to gently blot any

195
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,640
remaining solution from the leaves and

196
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,880
between the leaf joints. This this helps

197
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,959
keep the leaves dry, reduces the risk of

198
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,680
fungal infections, and allows the plant

199
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,680
to breathe more easily.

Then gently take the orchid pot out and

203
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,560
place it in a spot with gentle sunlight.

204
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,720
Proper exposure to light will help the

205
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,120
orchid photosynthesize effectively,

206
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:09,560
absorb nutrients better, and support a

strong and firmly attached to the

214
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:40,200

215
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:43,249

219
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,150

recover more quickly after a weakened

224

225
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,770
environmental changes or unfavorable

Although some leaves are still wilted,

235
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,160
once the roots begin functioning well,

236
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,560
the plant will gradually regain its

237
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,800
vitality. The leaves will absorb enough

238
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,940
water and minerals, slowly turning green

239
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:51,269
again and no longer appearing wilted.

[Music]

242
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,240
I continue caring for this orchid with

243
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,480
the natural fermented fertilizer made

244
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,399
from molasses, applying it regularly

245
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,480
twice a month.

246
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,480
It's a simple yet effective method that

247
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,839
helps the plant gradually recover and

248
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,839
grow stronger day by day.

249
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,800
Or you can alternate it with other

250
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,880
natural fertilizers.

251
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,519
Rotating nutrient sources helps the

252
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,519
plant absorb a wider range of nutrients,

253
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:37,240
promoting balanced and sustainable

254
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,240
growth over time.

255
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,839
After that, remember to place the orchid

256
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,000
pot in a spot with gentle sunlight to

257
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:48,600
help the plant photosynthesize

258
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,600
better during the recovery process.

259
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,240
And here is the result after 3 months.

260
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,240
You can see the orchid has fully

261
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,560
recovered. The the once wilted leaves

262
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,240
are now lush and green again. And the

263
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,360
plant is even beginning to grow a new

264
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,360

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,840
