00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,899
Welcome to my channel

2
00:00:07,065 --> 00:00:13,063
In my hand is a withered orchid

3
00:00:13,063 --> 00:00:20,896
and I will revive it with compost

4
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:26,895
The roots are dry

5
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:42,892
Cut off all damaged roots

6
00:00:56,907 --> 00:01:06,887
Removing damaged roots helps prevent healthy roots from rotting further

7
00:01:11,891 --> 00:01:18,885
and stimulates new roots to grow

8
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:28,883
Cut off withered branches

9
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:58,877
Rinse with water

10
00:02:16,765 --> 00:02:23,764
Soak in this water for 1 hour

11
00:02:28,871 --> 00:02:35,870
Take 1 aloe vera leaf and cut it into small pieces

12
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:45,868
Aloe vera contains nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, enzymes and amino acids 

13
00:02:45,868 --> 00:02:50,900
helps improve root and plant growth, 

14
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:56,899
thereby helping orchids better absorb nutrients from the soil.

15
00:03:02,898 --> 00:03:08,896
Put aloe vera in the jar

16
00:03:09,896 --> 00:03:16,895
Add 500ml of room temperature water

17
00:03:20,894 --> 00:03:28,892
Stir well and wait 1 hour

18
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:41,890
1 Hour later

19
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:50,888
Thoroughly wash the back and front of the leaves

20
00:03:52,888 --> 00:04:00,886
Helps remove dirt, mold, and insects on leaf surfaces

21
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:16,883
will help orchids recover faster

22
00:04:39,878 --> 00:04:48,877
Then put the orchid leaves in the jar

23
00:04:51,876 --> 00:05:00,874
Then pour in aloe vera water and soak for 30 minutes

24
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:16,871
Aloe vera gel contains many vitamins and also has a good moisturizing effect,

25
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:22,870
 helping wilted orchids quickly recover.

26
00:05:30,868 --> 00:05:36,900
Next I need oatmeal

27
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,899
Take 3 tablespoons of oatmeal

28
00:05:51,897 --> 00:05:56,896
then add 500ml of water

29
00:06:08,894 --> 00:06:16,892
Then stir well and wait 30 minutes for the nutrients to completely dissolve in the water

30
00:06:25,891 --> 00:06:31,889
After soaking for 30 minutes, filter the oatmeal water

31
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:39,888
Oats contain essential nutrients for plants such as vitamins, 

32
00:06:39,888 --> 00:06:46,886
minerals (such as magnesium, iron, zinc), carbohydrates and proteins, 

33
00:06:46,886 --> 00:06:54,885
Helps plants grow strongly and improves overall root health.

34
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:11,881
After soaking for 30 minutes, take the orchid out

35
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:30,878
Mix aloe vera juice with oatmeal water

36
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:46,875
Then soak the orchid roots in this water for 30 minutes

37
00:07:55,873 --> 00:08:02,871
will help restore roots and stimulate faster rooting

38
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:19,868
After soaking the roots for about 30 minutes, take the orchid out and plant it in a new pot

39
00:08:39,897 --> 00:08:46,896
I grow orchids with moss which helps retain moisture better

40
00:08:47,896 --> 00:08:55,894
Because moss retains moisture well, you need to be careful not to water it too much.

41
00:08:55,894 --> 00:09:02,893
Only water when the growing medium is dry

42
00:09:03,893 --> 00:09:11,891
If the growing medium is waterlogged for a long time, the roots will rot quickly

43
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:28,888
Filter this water

44
00:09:58,882 --> 00:10:06,880
Then water the orchid every 10 days

45
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:13,879
The carbohydrate components in oats stimulate root growth, 

46
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:20,877
Helps orchid roots grow longer and healthier,

47
00:10:20,877 --> 00:10:28,876
so the plant can absorb water and nutrients from the soil better.

48
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:36,874
Aloe vera has the ability to stimulate root growth, 

49
00:10:36,874 --> 00:10:43,873
especially for plants that are wilted or show signs of weakness. 

50
00:10:43,873 --> 00:10:50,871
This helps the orchid regrow healthy roots and improve vitality.

51
00:11:06,868 --> 00:11:15,900
It would be better if you soak the roots in this water for about 30 minutes and then take them out.

52
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:23,898
On weekdays, you spray the leaves with moisturizing water

53
00:11:23,898 --> 00:11:31,897
Or when the substrate is dry, spray water to keep the substrate moist

54
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:46,019
Then place the orchid pot in a cool place with enough light for the plant to recover

55
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:55,892
Remember, no amount of fertilizer will help your orchids if they are not receiving enough diffused light, at least 12 hours a day.

56
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:03,890
Results after 45 days

57
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:09,889
Leaves are fresher

58
00:12:20,887 --> 00:12:28,885
New roots grow a lot

59
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:40,883
When the roots grow, they will easily absorb water and nutrients to nourish the plant

60
00:12:40,883 --> 00:12:48,881
From there, the wilted leaves will quickly become fresh again

61
00:12:50,881 --> 00:12:56,880
Aloe vera gel has the ability to retain water, 

62
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,878
Helps keep soil and plant roots moist for longer periods of time. 

63
00:13:03,878 --> 00:13:10,877
This is very important when orchids wilt due to lack of water.

64
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:23,874
I hope my video is useful to you.

65
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:30,873
Wishing you in taking care of plants brings you joy and great results.

66
00:13:32,873 --> 00:13:38,871
Hope you like this composting recipe!

67
00:13:38,871 --> 00:13:45,870
