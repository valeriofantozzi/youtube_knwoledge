00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:03,866 --> 00:00:11,898
 
This video is a useful source of information for beginners growing orchids

3
00:00:12,498 --> 00:00:20,896
or having difficulty getting the orchid to bloom.

4
00:00:21,196 --> 00:00:29,895
The curriculum provides the basics of how to care for orchids, including:

5
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:35,893
Light, temperature, humidity and fertilizer help orchids bloom year-round.

6
00:00:35,893 --> 00:00:42,065
If you are interested in taking care of orchids, watch the video to learn more knowledge and skills.

7
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:46,891
1. Light

8
00:00:48,914 --> 00:00:56,889
 
Orchids need enough light to grow.

9
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:10,886
Make sure they get enough sunlight or good artificial light.

10
00:01:13,446 --> 00:01:23,884
You can place the orchid pot on the windowsill or under a specialized sun filter for orchids.

11
00:01:25,883 --> 00:01:33,882
If left in direct sunlight, orchids can easily die.

12
00:01:38,093 --> 00:01:41,880
2. Water and humidity.

13
00:01:43,735 --> 00:01:50,879
Water appropriately.

14
00:01:55,273 --> 00:02:05,876
Orchids usually need steady humidity, but don't keep the soil wet all the time.

15
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:20,873
Every month you water and soak the orchid pot in water once.

16
00:02:20,873 --> 00:02:30,871
This helps retain moisture and wash away excess humus and fertilizer in the orchid growing medium.

17
00:02:42,056 --> 00:02:52,900
On weekdays, when you see the substrate is dry, spray mist to keep the orchid pot moist.

18
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:03,897
3. Orchid planting materials.

19
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:16,895
Use the appropriate type of orchid growing medium,

20
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:25,893
Usually the material contains organic matter and has good drainage ability.

21
00:03:28,397 --> 00:03:38,890
I often use pine bark or pumice as the growing medium for orchids.

22
00:03:44,901 --> 00:03:56,887
When planting orchids, do not bury the stems deeply under the orchid growing medium.

23
00:03:58,365 --> 00:04:01,886
4. Wind is very important.

24
00:04:05,064 --> 00:04:16,883
Orchids need wind, but if the wind is strong, the orchid roots will shake, causing the orchid to wilt.

25
00:04:32,682 --> 00:04:36,879
5. Which fertilizer is good for orchids?

26
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:44,067
There are many types of fertilizer, but in this video I share a common type of fertilizer

27
00:04:44,656 --> 00:04:56,875
Rice 5 spoons.

28
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:12,872
Soak rice in water for 30 minutes.

29
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:25,869
30 MINUTES LATER

30
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:45,899
Filter residue.

31
00:05:47,742 --> 00:05:57,896
Add water to get 5 liters of liquid fertilizer solution.

32
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:06,894
Method 1: Fertilize through orchid roots.

33
00:06:06,894 --> 00:06:14,893
Water orchids with rice water 1-2 times/month

34
00:06:18,048 --> 00:06:28,890
Rice water contains minerals and trace elements that are beneficial to plants,

35
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:35,889
Helps provide necessary nutrition.

36
00:06:42,752 --> 00:06:52,885
Rice water helps orchids develop a stronger immune system,

37
00:06:54,739 --> 00:07:04,883
Helps fight diseases and pests.

38
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:29,878
Method 2: Fertilize through leaves.

39
00:07:31,861 --> 00:07:41,876
You can also spray rice water on the orchid 2-3 times a month.

40
00:07:46,371 --> 00:07:56,873
This method is similar to using foliar fertilizer.

41
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:16,869
Rice water helps stimulate the flowering process and flower more regularly.

42
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:39,898
RESULT.

43
00:08:40,936 --> 00:08:48,896
Orchids always grow well and are green.

44
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:56,894
and free from insects and fungal diseases.

45
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:08,892
Healthy orchids will develop many buds on the same plant.

46
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:26,888
The flowers hang on the branches for a long time before falling.

47
00:09:32,353 --> 00:09:40,885
and bloom continuously from season to season.

48
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:52,283
Hope the video will help you a lot.

00:09:55,695 --> 00:10:05,880
