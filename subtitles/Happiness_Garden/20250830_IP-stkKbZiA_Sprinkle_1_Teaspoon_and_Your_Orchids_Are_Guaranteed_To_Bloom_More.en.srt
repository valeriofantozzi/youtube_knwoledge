00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,799
Welcome to my channel. Here we will

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,279
explore together how to care for

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,120
beautiful orchid pots. From small tips

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:14,040
to natural tricks that help the plants

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,040
stay healthy and bloom brilliantly.

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,480
When your orchid petals begin to wither,

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,960
if you want the plant to continue

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,560
blooming and not become exhausted,

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,359
follow the steps that I will guide you

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,439
through right now.

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,599
First, gently cut off all the withered

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,840
petals. This is an important step to

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,000
release energy for the plant, helping

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,320
the roots and leaves receive adequate

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,760
nutrition, preparing for new, healthy,

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,760
and vibrant buds in the near future.

[Music]

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,160
Only keep the fresh petals and the buds

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
that have not yet opened so the plant

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,239
can continue to bloom and display

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,960
vibrant colors. This helps the plant

22
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,800
focus its energy on the living parts,

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,039
nurturing the flowers and buds in the

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,039
best way.

have you along for the journey.

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,200
Uh next we will remove the old pot in

31
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,600
which the plant was bought from the

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:34,200
industrial orchid garden and carefully

33
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,200
check the roots and the growing medium.

[Music]

35
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,680
Carefully cut off the damaged and

36
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,520
rotting roots. Uh, this helps the plant

37
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,280
focus nutrients on the healthy roots

38
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,680
while preventing the spread of fungi,

39
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,960
allowing the orchid to grow strongly and

40
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,960
prepare for new vibrant buds.

[Music]

42
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,760
Then remove about half of the old

43
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,400
growing medium, but keep the remaining

44
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,400
half so the plant does not get shocked.

45
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,480
This helps the orchid roots gradually

46
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,239
adapt to the new environment while

47
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,760
utilizing the remaining nutrients in the

48
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,760
medium for continued healthy growth.

50
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,720
This method also helps the remaining

51
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,879
flowers and buds on the stem continue to

52
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,720
develop, maintaining their freshness and

53
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,720
vibrancy while not weakening the plant.

59
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,720
Next, pour four cups of water equivalent

60
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,879
to about one liter into a container to

61
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,440
prepare the disinfecting solution before

62
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,440
replanting the orchid.

00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,380
[Music]

64
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,200
Then add five drops of methylene blue to

65
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,360
the solution. This helps disinfect the

66
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,640
roots and growing medium, protecting the

67
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,159
orchid from bacteria and fungi, uh

68
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,410
creating favorable conditions for the

69
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:53,999
plant to grow healthily and bloom again.

72
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,920
Next, pour the solution mixture into the

73
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,640
pot to soak the roots and growing medium

74
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,959
for about 10 to 20 minutes. This helps

75
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:17,720
disinfect all the roots and medium,

76
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,720
eliminating harmful bacteria or fungi.

77
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,800
This step helps the orchid roots stay

78
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,520
safe and get ready for replanting into

79
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,520
the new growing medium.

[Music]

81
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,720
Next, add the pine bark growing medium

82
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,280
into the solution mixture to soak. This

83
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,600
helps disinfect the medium, remove

84
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,440
impurities and harmful bacteria while

85
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,120
making the medium clean and ready to

86
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,759
support healthy root growth when

87
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,759
replanting the orchid.

[Music]

89
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,680
For the leaves, use a soft cloth soaked

90
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,600
in this solution and gently wipe both

91
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,430
the top and bottom surfaces of the

92
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,919

[Music]

94
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,160
Uh, wiping the leaves helps remove dust

95
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,240
on their surface, keeping the orchid

96
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,759
leaves clean, allowing them to absorb

97
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,560
light better, and enhancing

98
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,560
photosynthesis efficiency.

99
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,960
Uh, the solution mixture has a

100
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,280
disinfecting effect, helping reduce the

101
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,120
risk of harmful bacteria and fungi,

102
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,680
protecting the health of the leaves and

103
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,680

105
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,240
Clean leaves help the plant absorb CO2

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,400
and light more effectively, supporting

107
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,360
photosynthesis and nourishing the roots,

108
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,360
leaves, and flower buds.

109
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,440
When the leaves are healthy and clean,

110
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,840
the plant's energy is focused on

111
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,919
nurturing the flowers and buds, helping

112
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,400
the blooms last longer and maintain

131
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,560
strong, absorb nutrients well, and

132
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,450
support the plant in blooming

135
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,400
Next, gently take the orchid out and

136
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,880
plant it into the new pot with the

137
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,360
prepared growing medium. This step helps

138
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,360
the roots stay stable, grow healthily,

139
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,490
and prepare for new vibrant buds to

140
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:30,310

[Music]

142
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,680
I choose large-sized pine bark as the

143
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,680
growing medium. When combined with the

144
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,000
old moss, it creates good erration for

145
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,160
the roots while retaining some necessary

146
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,400
moisture, helping the orchid grow

147
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,690
healthily and bloom beautifully for a

148
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,660

[Music]

150
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,199
When placing the pine bark into the pot,

151
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:01,240
do it carefully to avoid breaking the

152
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,240
roots or damaging the plant.

153
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,080
Careful handling ensures the orchid

154
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,319
roots are not damaged, allowing the

155
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,560
plant to immediately absorb nutrients

156
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,560
from the new medium, supporting healthy

157
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,120
growth and nurturing the next buds to

158
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,120
bloom brilliantly.

159
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,360
Thus, the replanting is complete and you

160
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,159
can see that the orchid is not affected

161
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,760
at all. Right after planting, the roots

162
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,320
are ready to absorb nutrients from the

163
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:46,880
new medium.

[Music]

165
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,040
To keep the orchids stable and avoid

166
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,160
disturbing the roots, we need to insert

167
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,760
stakes to secure the two flower stems.

168
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,920
This helps prevent the flowers from

169
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,760
tilting or breaking while allowing the

170
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,440
roots to stay in place to absorb

171
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,080
nutrients effectively and support

172
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,080
healthy plant growth.

173
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,360
If you encounter any difficulties during

174
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,000
the orchid planting process, don't

178
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,399
Uh after planting, place the orchid pot

179
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,920
in a cool, ventilated area for one day

180
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:30,320

181
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,279
And now I will guide you on how to make

182
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,519
natural fertilizer for orchids.

183
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,160
The first ingredient I choose is rice.

184
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,320
Just one teaspoon. rice will provide

185
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,990
gentle natural nutrients helping the

186
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,920
orchid roots absorb them effectively.

188
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,519
Uh the next ingredient is an eggshell.

189
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,600
Just one shell. The combination of rice

190
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,000
and eggshell creates a mixture rich in

191
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,600
natural nutrients providing calcium and

192
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,519
energy for the orchid roots to grow

193
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,480
healthily while also helping the plant

194
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,320
bloom more beautifully.

195
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,440
Next, put the rice and eggshell mixture

196
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:10,380
into one cup of water, equivalent to 120

197
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,720
mm, and then blend it finely.

[Music]

199
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,640
This helps the nutrients dissolve in

200
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,480
water, making them easier to absorb by

201
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,340
the orchid roots, supporting healthy

202
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:27,479

205
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,360
Then pour the mixture into a clean jar,

206
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,360
cover it, and let it ferment for one

207
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,360
day.

[Music]

209
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,440
The fermentation process helps release

210
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,920
additional nutrients, creating a

211
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,320
nutrientrich natural fertilizer that

212
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,480
supports orchid roots in absorbing

213
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,480
effectively and promotes healthy plant

214
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,480
growth.

215
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,240
After one day, you need to stir the

216
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,380
mixture well so that the nutrients are

217
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,529
evenly distributed.

218
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,529
[Music]

219
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,800
Then strain out the remaining residue in

220
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,560
the mixture. This makes the fertilizer

221
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,720
solution smooth, allowing it to

222
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,560
penetrate the orchid roots easily,

223
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,680
ensuring the plant absorbs nutrients

224
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,680
effectively and grows healthily.

225
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:02,160
Next, dilute the mixture with four cups

226
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,600
of water, equivalent to about one liter.

227
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,680
This helps the solution become

228
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,440
moderately diluted, allowing it to

229
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,200
penetrate the orchid roots easily,

230
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,740
providing nutrients effectively and

231
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:21,200
safely for healthy plant growth.

[Music]

233
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,320
Method one, pour the mixture into a

234
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,240
spray bottle. This allows you to evenly

235
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,800
spray the solution onto the roots and

236
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,959
leaves, providing nutrients directly to

237
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,959
the orchid.

238
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,800
Then spray the solution onto both the

239
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,399
top and bottom surfaces of the leaves.

240
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,399
This helps the nutrients penetrate

241
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,560
evenly, nourishing healthy leaves,

242
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:53,240
supporting root and bud development, and

243
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,240
resulting in beautiful, vibrant flowers.

244
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,079
Spraying the solution allows nutrients

245
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,720
to be absorbed directly by the leaves

246
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,800
and buds, uh, supporting photosynthesis
