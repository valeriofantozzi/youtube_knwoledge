00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,720
Welcome to Happiness Garden. [music]

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,240
Denrobium orchids are a famous species

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,480
known for their bright and graceful

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,200
flowers. Even from dried, withered

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,040
orchid stems that seemed lifeless, you

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,065
can still bring about the miracle of

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,279
revival.

8
00:00:15,065 --> 00:00:19,119
[music] If you own Denrobium orchids

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,880
like these, don't rush to throw them

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,840
away because they still have the chance

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,560
to grow strongly. Let me guide you on

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,880
how to revive them in a simple, quick,

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,880
and [music] highly effective way so you

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,480
can enjoy the beauty of fresh young

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,040
shoots right before your eyes. [music]

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,300
First, carefully cut off all roots that

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,040
are damaged or rotted. This helps the

18
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,120
[music] plant focus its energy on the

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,160
healthy parts, creating conditions for

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,160
new roots to grow [music] strongly.

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,239
When you remove the weak roots, you are

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,320
paving the way for a vibrant revival of

23
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,320
the orchid.

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,160
After cutting off the damaged roots,

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,559
gently rinse all the remaining roots

26
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,039
under [music] a light stream of water.

27
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,800
This helps remove dirt and bacteria,

28
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,520
leaving the orchid clean and ready for

29
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,520
the next step of revival.

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,280
Next, take [music] a 2.5 mg B1 vitamin

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,560
tablet and dissolve it in 300 ml of

32
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,040
water to create [music] a root

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,880
stimulating solution. This solution will

34
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,159
help awaken the vitality within the

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,040
young roots, promoting [music] their

36
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,040
fast and healthy growth.

37
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,100
[music]

38
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:36,341
[music]

39
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:41,581
[music]

40
00:01:45,456 --> 00:01:47,476
>> [music]

41
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,280
>> After preparing the solution, [music]

42
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,920
soak the orchid roots for about 20 to 30

43
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,439
minutes. This time is enough for the B1

44
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,600
vitamin to penetrate deeply into [music]

45
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:05,799
the roots, stimulating their growth and

46
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,799
preparing them for a strong revival.

47
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,520
After soaking, gently take the [music]

48
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,840
orchid plant out and blot all the water

49
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,520
on the stem. This helps prevent excess

50
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,680
moisture and prepares [music] the plant

51
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,680
for planting.

52
00:02:22,136 --> 00:02:24,156
[music]

53
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,201
Next, I reuse used plastic cups,

54
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,200
recycling them into convenient planting

55
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:41,120
[music] containers. These cups help

56
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,879
create an ideal environment, stimulating

57
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,280
the roots and young shoots to grow

58
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,040
faster from the withered orchid stems.

59
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,280
This way, you save resources while

60
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,640
effectively caring for the plant, giving

61
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,640
each young chute a chance to revive.

62
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,561
>> [music]

63
00:03:36,807 --> 00:03:38,827
[music]

64
00:03:45,322 --> 00:03:47,342
[music]

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,799
>> After placing the orchid stem into the

66
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,560
planting container, add clean water just

67
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,480
enough so that the water level lightly

68
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,480
touches the older part of the plant

69
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,480
stem.

70
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,680
Next, [music]

71
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,840
place the planting pot in a cool, airy

72
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,000
spot with an ideal temperature of 20 to

73
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,359
30° C. [music]

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,120
This environments, the young orchid

75
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,120
grows steadily without heat shock or

76
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,560
wilting. When the plant is cared for

77
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,960
under suitable conditions, [music]

78
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,120
each young root will grow strong, ready

79
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,120
for the next stage of revival.

80
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,800
And here are the results after one month

81
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,800
of recovery.

82
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,759
You can see that from the old withered

83
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,639
orchids, the dormant buds have now

84
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,400
awakened and begun to sprout healthily.

85
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,639
This change shows that with love and

86
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,858
proper care, even stems that seemed

87
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,639
lifeless can miraculously revive.

88
00:04:48,858 --> 00:04:53,360
[music]

89
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,919
Although the shoots are still small, you

90
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,720
can see that their roots are developing

91
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,479
quite strongly. This is a great sign

92
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,479
showing that the orchid is absorbing

93
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,880
nutrients and preparing for the next

94
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,880
stage of growth.

95
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,280
Next, I replace the clean water and

96
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,800
continue planting so that the young

97
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,120
orchid has the best conditions for

98
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,360
growth. Maintaining a [music] clean and

99
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,039
sufficiently moist environment helps the

100
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,120
young roots grow strongly while

101
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,680
stimulating the orchid shoots to expand

102
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,680
and become healthier.

103
00:05:24,883 --> 00:05:26,903
[music]

104
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,840
And here are the results after 2 months

revival.

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,840
What do you think about the way I

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,360
revived this young orchid? Don't

our love for nature together.

197
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:18,640
[music] Orchids are famous for their

198
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,947
lasting beauty. Their blooms can open

199
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,519
and stay on the stem for a long time.

200
00:10:20,947 --> 00:10:23,440

[music] planet grow orchids.

206
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,640
However, many beginners still struggle

orchid growing tips. It's truly

216
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,000
wonderful to have you with me.

217
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,760
Let's get started.

218
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,480
First of all, the placement of the

219
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,959
orchid pot plays a very important role.

220
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,040
A spot with gentle light and good air

221
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:19,240
circulation will help the plant absorb

222
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,240
nutrients better and grow healthily.

223
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,800
Orchids need light for photosynthesis,

224
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,760
but they can't tolerate harsh direct

225
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,160
sunlight. The ideal spot is on a window

226
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,839
sill with a sheer curtain or under a

227
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,079
light shade structure made especially

228
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,079
for orchids.

229
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,920
Next, I'll share [snorts] with you a

230
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,120
simple yet highly effective way to make

231
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,640
organic [music] fertilizer for orchids.

232
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,320
With just a few familiar ingredients,

233
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:50,360
you'll help your plant grow strong roots

234
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,360
and bloom more beautifully.

235
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,279
All you need is three tablespoons of

236
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,640
cooked rice, a familiar ingredient

237
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,800
that's packed with nutrients [music] for

238
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,800
your plant.

239
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,200
Then grind the rice into a fine powder.

240
00:12:28,018 --> 00:12:30,038
>> [music]

241
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,000
>> Next, put the rice. powder into a clean

242
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
jar.

243
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,560
Next, I need to prepare a fresh aloe

244
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,079
vera leaf, an ingredient that helps

245
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,240
boost the plant's resistance.

246
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:09,240
Then, slice the aloe vera leaf into thin

247
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,240
pieces.

248
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,480
Put the aloe vera slices into the jar

249
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,480
with the rice powder you prepared

250
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,480
earlier.

251
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,920
Next, pour one liter of boiling water

252
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:36,040
into the jar to dissolve the nutrients

253
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,040
from the [music] rice and aloe vera.

254
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,440
Wrap a cloth around the jar to retain

255
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,000
heat. Then [music] let it sit until the

256
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,000
water cools completely.

257
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,199
Once the water is cooled, strain out the

258
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,959
residue and keep the clear,

259
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:18,720
nutrient-rich liquid.

260
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,120
In addition to the English voice over,

261
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,519
we have now created versions in French,

262
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,079

audio language.

270
00:14:40,985 --> 00:14:45,279
[music] Then add clean water to the

271
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:49,000
filtered liquid until you have about 3 L

272
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,000
of fertilizer solution.

273
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,720
Leave me a comment and let me know

274
00:14:51,465 --> 00:14:55,199
[music] which country you're watching

275
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:59,440
from. It's wonderful that we can connect

276
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:02,000
and chat uh from all around the world.

277
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,760
Method one, pour the solution into a

278
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,880
spray bottle and mist it directly onto

279
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,880
the orchid's leaves [music] and roots.

280
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,920
Spray the solution evenly on both the

281
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,079
top and underside of the leaves as well

282
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,399
as the roots to help the plant absorb it

283
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,399
most effectively.

284
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,519
About 30 minutes after spraying, if

285
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,680
there's still water on the leaves,

286
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,199
gently blot the excess with a soft cloth

287
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,120
from the surface and [music] between the

288
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,199
leaves.

289
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,680
This helps prevent leaf rot and keeps

290
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,680
the [music] plant healthy.

291
00:16:03,516 --> 00:16:05,536
>> [music]

292
00:16:08,756 --> 00:16:10,776
[music]

293
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,040
>> Just apply this method once every two

294
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,271
weeks and you'll see your orchid stay

295
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,360
lush.

296

>> and full of life like this.

298
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,320
Method two, you use the solution to

299
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,600
water directly onto the roots and

300
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,480
growing medium, [music] helping to

301
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,480
deliver nutrients from below.

302
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,600
Um, this method allows the roots to

303
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,600
naturally absorb nutrients, [music]

304
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,480
stimulating the plant to grow vigorously

305
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,480
from the base to the top.

306
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,800
Rice water is rich in vitamins and

307
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,720
minerals that nourish healthy roots,

308
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,079
while aloe vera has antibacterial

309
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,480
properties [music] and boosts the

310
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,326
plant's resistance.

311
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,480
Combining both helps orchids thrive

312
00:17:10,326 --> 00:17:14,160
[music] overall, encouraging fast root

313
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,799
growth, lush green leaves, and

314
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,799
long-lasting blooms.

315
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,959
You can choose method one, method

316
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:25,760
[music] two, or combine both for the

317
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,760
best results. Just apply it regularly

318
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:31,840
twice a month and your orchid will stay

319
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,520
healthy and bloom [music] beautifully.

320
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,720
And don't forget to place your orchid

321
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,320
pot in a spot with gentle [music]

322
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,320
sunlight so the plant can

323
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,559
photosynthesize and absorb nutrients

324
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,559
more effectively.

325
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,640
Uh and here is the result after 1 month

326
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:50,992
of care. You can see the plant has grown

327
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,992
many new roots full of vitality. [music]

328
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,520
Uh, a healthy root system helps the

329
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,280
plant absorb water and nutrients more

330
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:05,320
efficiently, leading to vigorous growth

331
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,320
and long-lasting blooms.

332
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,440
That's why roots are often compared to

333
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,200
the heart of an orchid. Because if the

334
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,120
roots are healthy, the plant will

335
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,847
thrive, grow strong, and bloom

336
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,847
beautifully. [music]

337
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,840
A healthy root system not only keeps the

338
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,360
plant stable, but is also the key to

339
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,360

Natural fertilizers usually work more

353
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,400
slowly than synthetic ones, but once the

354
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,280
