every leaf and every flower tells you a

gentle story of love and life.

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,599
In this video, I continue sharing with

you how to make natural fertilizer,

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,240
gentle yet highly effective to help

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,920
revive your orchid after it has finished

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,320
blooming so it can keep growing strong

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,320
and bloom again like a radiant gift from

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,320
nature.

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,440
Let's get started. This is an orchid

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,920
that people once thought was dead and

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,440
thrown away, but I picked it up because

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,079
I believe that with just a little hope

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,440
and gentle care, it could come back to

17
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,920
life and bloom once again.

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,399
First, you need to gently remove the

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,399
yellow and damaged leaves because they

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,480
no longer contribute to the plant's life

21
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,590
and only hinder its natural recovery

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:12,610
process.

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,759
Next, trim off the withered flower

25
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,520
spikes because once they've lost their

26
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,520
original beauty, they should be removed

27
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,920
so the plant can focus on nourishing its

28
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:28,280
roots and leaves, preparing for a

29
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,280
vibrant new blooming season.

35
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,520
The damaged roots, the hollow ones that

36
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,240

need to be cut off.

38
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,200
This is like helping the plant let go of

39
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:03,479
its burdens so it can focus its energy

40
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,479
on nurturing the healthy parts.

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,600
Cutting off the damaged roots also helps

42
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,840
the plant avoid the risk of rot

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,680

44
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,340

205
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,480
I continue caring for the plant by

206
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:37,480
applying natural fertilizer made from

211
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,920
moisture and essential nutrients to

212
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:10,519

the aloe vera mixture and wipe it evenly

provide natural moisture to the leaves,

221
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,750

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,880
healthy root system, the orchid will

248
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,399

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,399
