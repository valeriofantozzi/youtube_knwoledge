Hello everyone. Today I'm sharing a way

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,920
to propagate orchids using a simple and

4
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,280
easy method that anyone can

5
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,120
do. Please cut across here to take the

6
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,440
flower spike for propagation using the

7
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,440
cutting method.

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,359
When the petals have just faded, it's

10
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,359
the best time to take cutings for orchid

[Music]

12
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,799
propagation. The parts of the flower

13
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,600
that have already fully bloomed can no

14
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,600
longer be used for

15
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:26,640
propagation. And choose the raised or

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,640
protruding parts of the flower spike.

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,439
a new plant will begin to grow right at

this spot.

25
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,720

growing tips. It's wonderful to have you

32
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:01,920
along. Uh make a diagonal cut here as it

33
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,920
will help with easier water absorption.

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,159
Next, you need to prepare an aloe vera

35
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,480
leaf. Choose a fresh, thick leaf that is

36
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,560
not damaged.

37
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,159
Aloe vera has antibacterial properties

38
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,159
and helps the orchid grow

39
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,640
stronger. Once you have the aloe vera

40
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,640
leaf, cut it into thin

41
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,440
slices. Let me know in the comments

42
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,440
which country you're watching this video

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:52,040

45
00:03:52,270 --> 00:04:03,860
[Laughter]

46
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,159
After cutting the aloe vera into thin

47
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,519
slices, place them in a cup and add

48
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,519
about 500 ml of water.

49
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,160
Um, the water will help dissolve the

50
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,600
nutrients from the aloe vera, creating a

51
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,080
supplement that aids in the healthy

52
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,080
growth of the

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,160
orchid. To enhance the effectiveness,

54
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,880
you can add a little honey to the aloe

55
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,639
vera water

56
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:47,080
solution. Honey helps the orchid fight

57
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,080
bacteria and provides extra nutrients.

58
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,759
Just add about 1 teaspoon of honey to

59
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,759
the cup and stir well to mix the

60
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,759
ingredients.

61
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,160
Leave the cup of water in a cool place

62
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,479
for a few hours so the nutrients from

63
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,720
the aloe vera and honey dissolve into

64
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,720
the

65
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,080
water. After the solution has been

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,800
soaked for a few hours, use a strainer

67
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,800
to filter out the residue.

68
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,280
You only need to keep the clear liquid

69
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,120
which contains the dissolved nutrients

70
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,160
from the aloe vera and honey to nourish

71
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,160
the orchid in the best way.

72
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,759
After filtering out the residue, soak

73
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,280
the orchid cutting you want to propagate

74
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,280
in this aloe vera and honey mixture.

75
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,440
uh soak it for about 20 minutes to allow

76
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,280
the orchid cutting to absorb the

77
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,000
nutrients and boost its ability to

78
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,759
develop strong roots. This is an

79
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,120
important step to ensure the cutting can

80
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,120
thrive during the propagation

81
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:49,120
process. You can use the remaining aloe

82
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,919
vera and honey mixture to water other

83
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,919
orchids in your garden.

84
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,600
[Music]

85
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,199
Uh this solution will provide additional

86
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,880
nutrients for the orchid promoting

87
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,880
healthy growth from the roots to the

88
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,599
leaves. When watering the orchids, just

89
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:15,479
apply about 10 tablespoons of the

90
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,479
solution to each pot.

91
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,280
This amount of water will be enough to

92
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,400
provide nutrients without causing the

93
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,400
plants to become water

94
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:36,319
logged. Make sure to water evenly around

95
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,520
the base of the plant to help it absorb

96
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,520
the nutrients in the best way.

97
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,039
In addition to the English voiceover, we

98
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,160
have now created voiceovers in French,

99
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,560

104
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,160
voiceover, we have created subtitles so

105
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,000
you can read and understand the content.

106
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,000
With the aloe vera and honey nutrient

107
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,039
mixture, you can water the orchid about

108
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,039
one to two times a

109
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:28,300

110
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,960

blooming.

116
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,919
Avoid direct intense sunlight as it can

117
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,919
cause the orchid's leaves to

118
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:59,399
burn. This is the floral foam I will use

119
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,399
to arrange the orchid cutting.

120
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,279
Floral foam helps keep the orchid

121
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,120
cutting in place and retains moisture,

122
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,120
creating favorable conditions for root

123
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,120
development.

124
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,800
After preparing the floral foam, get a

125
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,120
clear glass cup ready for rooting the

126
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,720
orchid

127
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,120

128
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,680
you to easily observe the cutting's

129
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,480

environment for the

131
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,279

132
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,440
in the aloe vera and honey solution for

133
00:09:53,279 --> 00:10:00,040
about 20 minutes, gently remove it and

134
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,040
use a clean paper towel to dry it.

[Music]

141
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,600
This helps protect the cut from bacteria

142
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,839
and fungi while also preventing moisture

143
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,279
from evaporating too quickly through the

144
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,640
cut, helping the cutting retain internal

145
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:50,399
moisture. It's a small but very

146
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:54,040
effective tip to increase the survival

147
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,040
rate of orchid cutings.

149
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,320
Then insert the orchid cutting into the

floral foam, making sure the base is

151
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,680
securely and uprightly positioned.

152
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,079
Next, place the floral foam into the

153
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,079
clear glass container. This method helps

154
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,760
retain moisture for the orchid cutting

After placing the cutting into the

159
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,959
floral foam, add filtered water to the

160
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,320
glass container, ensuring the foam is

161
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,320
moist but not submerged in

162
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,120
water. This helps maintain the necessary

163
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,760
moisture for the cutting without causing

164
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,279
root

165
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,200
rot. Make sure the floral foam doesn't

166
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,839
dry out as orchids need moisture to

167
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,760
develop roots and shoots. Remember to

168
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,000
add water when you notice the foam

169
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,440
getting

170
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,320
dry. Then cover the glass jar to

171
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,680
maintain moisture for the

172
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,440
cutting. After that, place the orchid

173
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,279
cutting in a spot with gentle sunlight,

174
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,880
avoiding direct intense

175
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:46,880
sunlight. Just be patient and the orchid

176
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,920
cutting will gradually develop roots and

177
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,920
grow into a new plant.

179
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,079
Now after 3 weeks you can see that the

orchid cutting has sprouted and

181
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,920
developed

182
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:09,760

183
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,639
process has been successful and the

184
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,639
orchid is growing well.

185
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,079
Since the chute is still small and the

186
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,639
roots are weak, I will continue to root

187
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:33,040
the orchid uh cutting in the glass cup

188
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,279

grow stronger.

190
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,040
After a while of rooting the cutting,

191
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,199
you should change the water in the glass

from impurities.

194
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,760
You can change the water weekly or when

195
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,040
you notice the water in the cup becoming

196
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,959
cloudy. Be sure not to leave the water

197
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,680

198
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,680

201
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,800
After 5 weeks, you'll notice that the

202
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,600
chute has sprouted leaves and the roots

203
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,600
have become stronger.

204
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,440
Since the leaves are still weak and the

205
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,199
roots are young, I've decided to

206
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,920
continue rooting the orchid cutting in

207
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,839
the glass cup for a little longer so the

208
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,839
plant can grow stronger and develop more

209
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,839
steadily.

210
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,480
during this time. Make sure the plant

211
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:44,360
still receives gentle sunlight and that

212
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,360
the water remains clean.

214
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,800
Once the leaves and roots have developed

215
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:09,480
stronger, I will transfer the plant to a

216
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,480
larger pot to continue caring for it.

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,240
orchid cutting process, don't don't

220
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,320
hesitate to leave a comment. I'm always

221

ready to support you so you can

222
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,000
successfully propagate healthy orchids.

223
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,120
After 8 weeks, the new chute is healthy

224
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,560
with vibrant green leaves and strong

225
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,799
roots. Your orchid has successfully

226
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,439
passed through the fragile early stage

227
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,439
and is now thriving.

228
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,240
At this point, you can transfer the

229
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,200
plant to a pot to continue caring for it

230
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,200

232
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,760
When transferring the orchid to a pot,

233
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,080
you can use pine bark chips as the

234
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,080
growing medium.

235
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,440
Pine bark helps with good drainage,

236
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,520
maintains the right level of humidity,

237
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,400
and creates an ideal environment for

238
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,400
orchid roots to

239
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:25,200
grow. Make sure the pot has good

240
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,200
drainage holes to prevent root

241
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:31,840
rot. Before placing the orchid into the

242
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,400
pot, spread a thin layer of moss on the

243
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,320
surface. This moss layer helps retain

244
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,679
moisture in the growing medium, creates

245
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,760
favorable conditions for root

246
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,360

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,360

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,919
of the moss layer and gently pack moss

251
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,919
around the roots to secure the plant in

252
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,919
place.

253
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,200
Uh when the orchid is healthy and has a

254
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,039
strong root system, we can start

255
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,170
fertilizing it after repotting to

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:29,160
500 ml of water and 1 tbsp of rice. Then

260
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,160
let it soak for a few hours.

265
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:58,559

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,000
the rice water and use it to water the

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
orchid.

271
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,400
Rice water contains many natural

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,559
nutrients that help stimulate root

273
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,880

274
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,880
for the plant.

275
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,700
After that, you can water the orchid

276
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:50,200
with rice water about one to two times a

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,120
provide nutrients to the plant without

280
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,120
overwhelming it.

281
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,760
Be sure to observe the condition of the

282
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,760
plant to adjust the amount of water

283
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,720
accordingly. On regular days when the

284
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,200
substrate is dry, you just need to mist

285
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,320
or water the orchid

286
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,919
lightly. This helps maintain the

287
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,559
necessary moisture for the plant without

288
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,760
causing water logging as orchids do not

289
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:30,269
like overly wet soil.
