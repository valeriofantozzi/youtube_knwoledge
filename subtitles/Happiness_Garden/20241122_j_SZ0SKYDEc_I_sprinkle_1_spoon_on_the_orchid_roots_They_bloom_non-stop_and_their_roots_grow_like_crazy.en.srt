16
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,520
uh incubate until the water cools so 
that the nutrients from the garlic and  

17

turmeric starch are completely 
dissolved in the water [Music]

18
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:59,840
after the water cools we 
filter it to remove sediment

00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:18,120
substrate guys please write a 
comment letting me know which

00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,520
country you're watching my video from the of

24
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:29,760
fence it's great to know that 
we can communicate worldwide

00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,080
[Music]

26
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,400
uh to know if it's time to water 
orchids I look at the color of the

27
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:29,720
roots when the Orchid Roots have a light 
silver color it's time to water the Orchid

28
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,800
if the roots are bright green you should 
wait until the roots turn pale silver before

29
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:51,640
watering if you water when the 
roots are still green The Roots  

30
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:59,640
will easily become water logged and cause root rot

31
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,960
My Maids are tired and

32
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:28,760
sleeping and the cat seems to be hunting down the  

33
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:34,480
mice that are destroying my orchids 
orchids grown in pots with drainage

34
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:42,440
holes I water this one to two times a

35
00:05:42,440 --> 00:06:02,880
month soak the roots in the this water for about 
20 minutes to help the roots absorb nutrients

36
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,480
[Music]

37
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:16,720
best um the finished infusion 
for orchids helps strengthen  

38
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:29,560
the immune system promotes the 
development of the root system

39
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,920
this water is also very good when sprayed on

40
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:44,320
Orchids spraying your Orchids 
with garlic and turmeric water  

41
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:59,520
will protect them from diseases 
pests and boost their immune system

42
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,760
spray the entire Orchid from leaves to

43
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:29,520
Roots but you should not water the flowers 
because wet flowers will quickly fall off

44
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,160
do it one to two times a

45
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:51,000
month if you have a very humid climate 
orchids are susceptible to Leaf base rot to  

46
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,440
prevent orchids from rotting at the base of the 
leaves you can use cotton balls to protect them

47
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:24,840
now spray the cotton with garlic and 
turmeric water and spray it on your  

48
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,440
orchids to protect them from diseases 
pests and boost the immune system

49
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:59,440
leave the cotton there for 
20 minutes then remove it

50
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:29,360
then you take the Clear Water above

51
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,280
if you don't have access to spraying orchids you  

52
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,960
can wipe the leaves with a 
cotton pad soaked in this

53
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:44,800
[Music] water will help remove mineral 
salts still attached to the leaf

54
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:59,320
surface helps orchid leaves avoid 
burning when exposed to sunlight

55
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,160
uh this not only clears the dust but also provides  

56
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:18,720
them with nutrients and protects 
them from diseases and [Music]

57
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:29,320
pests thoroughly wipe both 
the top and bottom of the leaf

58
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,120
do this one or two times a

59
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:59,240
month uh it is enough to keep the 
Orchid in this water for 20 minutes

60
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:29,240
soaked in this water The Roots will change 
from Silver to purple blue like this

[Music]

62
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,560
then place the Orchid pot 
in a warm place with lots  

63
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:59,240
of diffused light so the Orchid will grow quickly

64

[Music]  

65
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,680

light

69
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:29,160
result um the leaves are always 
green and shiny like this

70
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,480
the roots are green large and

71
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:49,200
healthy thanks to the clean Leaf 
surface orchid leaves photosynthesize

72
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:59,840
better when orchids have enough light for 
photosynthesis they will always be healthier than

73
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:11,240
usual thanks to this care the Orchid produces many
