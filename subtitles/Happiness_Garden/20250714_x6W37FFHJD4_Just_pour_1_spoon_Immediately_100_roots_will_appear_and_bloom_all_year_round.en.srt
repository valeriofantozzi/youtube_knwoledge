In this video, I will share with you a

completely new way to make organic

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,820
fertilizer that's easy to prepare at

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,000
This fertilizer not only helps orchids

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,079
grow strong from roots to leaves, but

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,920
can also stimulate them to bloom all

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,920
year round naturally and sustainably.

[Music]

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,640
When the orchid has been grown in a pot

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,399
for a long time, its roots become dense

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,360
and no longer have enough space to

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,840
spread. This causes the plant to grow

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,920
slowly, makes it difficult for new roots

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,799
to emerge, and affects the overall

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,560
development of the plant.

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,240
Orchid leaves gradually lose their

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,640
vibrant green color when they are not

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,119
provided with the necessary nutrients.

28
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,320
Instead, they may turn pale yellow,

29
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:20,680
become dull, or develop unusual spots,

30
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,680
indicating that the plant is weakening.

32
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,439
Therefore, after about 1 to two years,

33
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,000
uh we should repot the orchid to allow

34
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,880
the roots to grow more freely and absorb

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,640
nutrients more effectively. This is an

36
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,600
important step to help the plant recover

37
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,600
and continue growing healthily.

39
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,680
As you can see, due to the cramped space

40
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,840
in the pot, many roots have started to

41
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,000
deteriorate. They are pressed tightly

42
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,160
together, unable to breathe properly,

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,680
and gradually rot, directly affecting

44
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,680
the overall health of the plant.

after carefully inspecting the root

48
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,800
the damaged, mushy, or brittle roots.

49
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,599
This will help the plant avoid

232
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,610
