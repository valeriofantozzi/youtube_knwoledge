199
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,490
let the water level cover part of the

200
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:05,580

202
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,920
pot the water will absorb itself helping

203
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,720
to maintain the moisture in the growing

204
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:19,920
medium we will not need to water

206
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,240
anymore when the water in the container

207
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:28,100
is empty remember to add more water to

208
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:31,160
keep the growing medium in a moist state

wellmaintained the roots will grow very

224
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,639
quickly a strong root system will help

225
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:30,120
the plant perform metabolism and absorb

226
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:30,120
organic fertilizer and water very well

227
