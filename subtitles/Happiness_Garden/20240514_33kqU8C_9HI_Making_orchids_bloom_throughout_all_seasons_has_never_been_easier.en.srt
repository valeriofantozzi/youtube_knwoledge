Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:37,493
If you are an orchid grower, when you eat an apple, don't throw away the peel.

3
00:00:37,493 --> 00:00:46,305
Today I will show you how to recycle eggshells into organic fertilizers to help spread more flowers.

4
00:00:46,305 --> 00:00:52,006
Just peel an apple like this and put all the peels in a jar

5
00:00:52,006 --> 00:01:03,078
add 1 small aloe leaf

6
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:15,000
Add 1 liter of boiling water

7
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:25,524
Cover and leave in a cool place for 12 hours to allow the apple and aloe vera to ferment naturally.

8
00:01:26,215 --> 00:01:32,693
and it will make special organic fertilizer for orchids

9
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:45,000
Peel off the protective film of the sleeping sprouts

10
00:01:51,656 --> 00:02:00,000
12 hours after soaking in boiled water

11
00:02:05,736 --> 00:02:11,738
filter out residue

12
00:02:14,942 --> 00:02:20,848
Use cotton to soak this water

13
00:02:23,415 --> 00:02:33,139
then clamp the sprout to sleep to wake up the sprout

14
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:40,164
Do this once a week

15
00:02:46,128 --> 00:02:55,266
when the flower has faded and the flower top has ceased to bloom,

16
00:02:55,266 --> 00:04:04,682
I also put flowers here to spread new flowers

17
00:04:12,575 --> 00:04:24,616
I put a cotton pad soaked in apple juice + aloe vera in between the leaves

18
00:04:31,107 --> 00:04:49,367
When the cotton is dry, on normal days, you just need to mist with water to keep the orchid moist.

19
00:04:56,021 --> 00:05:06,631
Next, I use this water to water my orchid once a week

20
00:05:06,631 --> 00:05:16,099
Apple peel contains a lot of Vitamin A,
vitamin C and rich in Potassium, Calcium, Phosphorus

21
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:27,654
When you do this, it makes it easier for the nutrients to be absorbed.

22
00:05:27,654 --> 00:05:38,317
Please moisten before watering, the effect will be higher

23
00:05:55,377 --> 00:06:06,213
45 days after use

24
00:06:06,213 --> 00:06:14,748
lots of new flowers are growing

25
00:06:14,748 --> 00:06:25,234
This will help your orchid to continuously bloom again and again

26
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:36,621
If you regularly fertilize your orchids with specialized fertilizers,

27
00:06:36,621 --> 00:06:44,604
your orchid will bloom all four seasons of the year.

28
00:06:51,569 --> 00:07:12,600
Withered flowers also grow new flowers after 45 days thanks to recycled apple peel + aloe

29
00:07:18,553 --> 00:07:34,373
In the middle of the leaves also sprout new flowers after 45 days of use

30
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:48,337
New roots also begin to grow after 45 days of use

31
00:07:48,337 --> 00:07:56,079
And with this simple way, the regenerated flower branch will be very big and fat

32
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:03,738
