Hello friends

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,366
Today I will show you how when we need to water the orchid

3
00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:10,771
When the orchid's roots are green like this, the orchid has enough water

4
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:17,238
The leaves will be green and sturdy

5
00:00:26,501 --> 00:00:31,366
But if the roots turn white, the plant is lacking water

6
00:00:31,366 --> 00:00:35,303
check the potting medium you will find it very dry

7
00:00:35,303 --> 00:00:41,917
Leaves will wilt very quickly if we don't water them in time

8
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:50,060
In this case, we need to quickly water the orchid

9
00:00:52,901 --> 00:00:56,444
HOW TO WATER AS FOLLOWING:

10
00:00:56,444 --> 00:01:02,994
Place the orchid pot in a deep dish and water the substrate completely

11
00:01:40,172 --> 00:01:48,768
If the roots are still fresh but the leaves are wilted, we can soak the orchid in water for 20-30 minutes

12
00:01:56,366 --> 00:02:01,343
With pots using moss growing medium, the ability to retain moisture is very good,

13
00:02:01,343 --> 00:02:05,291
so we only need to water enough moisture.

14
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:09,388
and no need to soak.

15
00:02:13,905 --> 00:02:19,073
Eat bananas, don't throw away the peels

16
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:24,404
Banana peel contains a lot of vitamins and minerals:

17
00:02:24,404 --> 00:02:29,020
vitamins A, B, C, E and protein, phosphorus, especially rich in potassium.

18
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:36,334
Potassium resists drought very well, helps the orchid to transport water from the root to the top, so the orchid does not wilt

19
00:02:36,334 --> 00:02:43,062
At the same time, potassium helps to stimulate flower growth and keep flowers fresh for a long time

20
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:04,439
We cut banana peels

21
00:03:08,683 --> 00:03:14,600
Put all banana peels in a jar and pour 500ml of boiled water

22
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,784
Then incubate for 1 day for the nutrients to dissolve into the water

23
00:03:39,272 --> 00:03:45,680
5 vitamin b1 tablets mixed with 500ml of filtered water

24
00:03:46,507 --> 00:03:52,433
B1 helps plants to better absorb nutrients

25
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:56,179
and growth regulator

26
00:03:56,179 --> 00:04:00,888
It also stimulates root growth very well

27
00:04:04,038 --> 00:04:12,649
After 1 day of incubation, we mix banana juice with vitamin B1 water to get 1 liter of synthetic organic fertilizer solution.

28
00:04:36,618 --> 00:04:41,611
Divide into a spray bottle

29
00:04:53,118 --> 00:04:58,108
Spray the top and bottom of the leaves evenly

30
00:04:58,108 --> 00:05:06,763
Orchid plants are provided with a part of nutrients that are supplemented through the leaves

31
00:05:06,763 --> 00:05:15,486
At the same time, it also eliminates insects to help the orchid stay green

32
00:05:22,246 --> 00:05:29,616
You can also use a cotton ball soaked in this synthetic organic fertilizer solution to wipe the leaves

33
00:05:29,616 --> 00:05:37,535
Do this 1-2 times a month, the orchid will always be protected and green

34
00:05:58,147 --> 00:06:05,128
Next, you use this liquid synthetic organic fertilizer solution to irrigate the orchid

35
00:06:05,128 --> 00:06:12,964
do 1-2 times a month and combine with other organic fertilizers that I have shared on the channel

36
00:06:12,964 --> 00:06:21,252
It will help orchids easily absorb nutrients

37
00:06:21,252 --> 00:06:27,026
Vitamin B1 helps stimulate root growth

38
00:06:27,026 --> 00:06:33,489
Potassium in banana juice will stimulate flower growth and help flowers stay fresh for a long time

39
00:06:33,489 --> 00:06:39,574
It is truly the perfect formula for the full development of roots, leaves and flowers

40
00:06:39,574 --> 00:06:46,469
It's very good, but you should not overdo it, it will harm the orchid

41
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:54,170
You should only fertilize according to my instructions so that your orchid garden always blooms without affecting the growth of orchids.

42
00:06:56,774 --> 00:07:02,885
Please comment below about your results

43
00:07:08,267 --> 00:07:14,653

44
00:07:18,213 --> 00:07:24,314
In addition to the English dub, we've now created dubs in French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, 

45
00:07:24,314 --> 00:07:30,614

Hello friends!

49
00:08:04,457 --> 00:08:12,000
When you plant a lot of orchids, you will not be able to avoid rotten orchids.

50
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:20,291
You see my orchid has been infected with a fungus.

51
00:08:24,843 --> 00:08:29,049
If not treated promptly, the orchid may die.

52
00:08:44,335 --> 00:08:48,541
 
Even though it's rotten, it's still fresh when cut across.

53
00:08:55,987 --> 00:09:00,000
It is also a favorable condition for the spread to respawn faster.

54
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:10,742
We need to cut off the branches and remove all the rot.

55
00:09:17,912 --> 00:09:21,980
This will prevent rot from spreading.

56
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:30,875
Then rinse with water.

57
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:45,699
Take 1 cup of room temperature water (about 3000ml).

58
00:09:52,869 --> 00:09:58,454
Mix 1 tablespoon of unsweetened fresh milk into the water.

59
00:10:15,001 --> 00:10:18,380
add 1 vitamin B1 tablet.

60
00:10:28,721 --> 00:10:34,168
Use a cotton ball to absorb the mixture of B1 water and milk.

61
00:10:39,684 --> 00:10:44,442
Then wipe the top and bottom of the leaves.

62
00:10:51,336 --> 00:10:55,956
This water mixture has a disinfecting effect.

63
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:04,600
Helps get rid of fungal diseases.

64
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:15,375
Then use this mixture of water B1 and milk to soak the orchid root for 20 minutes.

65
00:11:35,782 --> 00:11:40,402
The rest is used to spray other normal orchids.

66
00:11:46,607 --> 00:11:50,860
Helps get rid of fungal diseases.

67
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,618
and supplement necessary nutrients for orchids.

68
00:12:11,888 --> 00:12:17,634
After soaking for about 20 minutes, take out the orchid leaves and dry the cut.

69
00:12:53,048 --> 00:13:02,713
use toothpaste Applying it on a cut will help it heal faster will protect orchids from rot.

70
00:13:26,677 --> 00:13:34,667
While waiting for it to dry, I recycle old plastic containers to make tools to revive orchids.

71
00:13:49,335 --> 00:13:55,302
Use industrial cotton to put it in the pot.

72
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:10,899
then let the orchid in.

73
00:14:15,926 --> 00:14:22,897
Next, every 3 days, spray moisturizing mist with normal water.

74
00:14:25,372 --> 00:14:30,362
Then put the orchid pot in a cool place.

75
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:38,899
The most suitable temperature for reviving orchids is from 20-30 degrees Celsius.

76
00:14:41,657 --> 00:14:45,036
1 MONTH LATER.

77
00:14:49,862 --> 00:14:54,206
The orchid has rooted very well.

78
00:15:01,238 --> 00:15:04,617
and grow 1 more young leaf.

79
00:15:08,202 --> 00:15:11,719
B1 stimulates rooting very well.

80
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:21,440
Milk contains natural calcium to help orchids stay strong and increase resistance.

81
00:15:42,135 --> 00:15:49,375
Now I grow orchids in pots with moss so that it adapts to the outside environment.
