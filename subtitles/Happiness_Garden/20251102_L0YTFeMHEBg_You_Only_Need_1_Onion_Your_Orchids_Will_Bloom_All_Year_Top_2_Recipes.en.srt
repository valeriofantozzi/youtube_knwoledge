the mixture and gently wipe both the top

72
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,360
and bottom of the leaves.

73
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,560
Wiping the leaves helps remove dust and

74
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,880
impurities, allowing the plant to absorb

75
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,880

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,400
Wiping the leaves helps create a natural

92
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,240
protective layer, making the leaves

93
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,720
glossy and giving the plant a fresh,

94
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,720
vibrant look.

leaves, especially the underside where

105
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,440
fungi and pests are more likely to

106
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,280
thrive.

107
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,840
Spraying this mixture is like washing

When the roots are healthy and strong,

230
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,800
the plant will have a solid foundation

253
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,000

to revive weak orchids with yellowing or

280
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:11,120
wilting leaves using aloe vera. Because

281
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,440
inside the aloe vera leaf, there is a

282
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,759
natural gel rich in nutrients that helps

283
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,839

284
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,140

For orchids with wrinkled leaves due to

359
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,320
wilting, you just need to water the

you only need to water them with aloe

369
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:15,799
enough for the plant to absorb nutrients

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,400
weeks. This simple method will help

382
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:03,180
orchids grow better and keep the flowers

383
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:14,520
fresh longer with stronger stems.

Now let's take a look at the results

386
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:21,600
after 2 weeks.

387
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,080
You can see a little caterpillar on this

388
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,720
leaf, which shows that the new leaf has

389
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,400
become tender and soft, making it a

390
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,400
favorite spot for the caterpillar to

391
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,400
stay.

392
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,280
I gently guided the caterpillar to

393
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,110
another spot so it would not continue

394
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:45,140
damaging my orchid.

396
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,360
You can see that my wilted orchid has

397
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,200
started to grow many new roots. These

398
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,200
new roots will help the plant absorb

399
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,200
more nutrients and water, allowing the

400
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,200
wilted leaves to quickly regain their

401
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,200
vitality.

403
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,720
These new roots will help the orchid

404
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,120
absorb nutrients and water more

405
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,580
effectively, thereby restoring vitality

406
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:19,000
to the leaves and the entire plant.

408
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:25,120
Therefore, roots are often referred to

409
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,200
as the heart of the orchid because they

410
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,280
play an important role in nourishing and

411
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,670
sustaining the vitality of the entire

412
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,120
plant.

414
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,679
Therefore, to help orchids grow well, we

415
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,600
need to focus on caring for the roots

416
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,780
first, ensuring they are healthy to

417
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,640
nourish the entire plant.

419
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,480
When the roots are healthy, they will

420
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,400
absorb nutrients efficiently, thereby

421
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,280
nourishing the plant and giving us

422
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,280
vibrant flowers.

423
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,520
And when the flowers bloom, they are not

424
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,520
only beautiful, but also fragrant,

425
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,520
bringing joy and relaxation to everyone

426
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,520
around.
