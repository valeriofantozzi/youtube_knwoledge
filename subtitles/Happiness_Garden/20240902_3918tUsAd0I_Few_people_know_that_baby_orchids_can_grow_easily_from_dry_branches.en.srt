Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:16,897
In this video, I share an easy method for propagating Phalaenopsis orchids from cuttings.

3
00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:36,893
when the last flowers are no longer on the branches.

4
00:00:38,893 --> 00:00:48,891
This is a very suitable time for us to propagate orchids

5
00:00:51,890 --> 00:01:05,887
Please choose the parts that contain small sprouts.

6
00:01:19,885 --> 00:01:29,883
When the branches are fresh and have a lot of resin inside, propagation will be faster.

7
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:56,877
Use cinnamon powder sprinkled on cuts to help disinfect and prevent rot.

8
00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:11,874
then wait a day for the cut to dry completely.

9
00:02:14,337 --> 00:02:23,872
And sprinkle cinnamon powder here to help prevent stem rot.

10
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:48,867
Take 1 clove of garlic and cut it into thin slices.

11
00:03:00,898 --> 00:03:09,896
Then pour in 600ml of water.

12
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:28,892
I took 3 spoons of rice.

13
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:46,889
Wait 30 minutes for the nutrients to completely dissolve in the water.

14
00:03:48,707 --> 00:03:52,888
A DAY LATER

15
00:03:54,887 --> 00:04:06,885
Use flower arranging foam and fixed bar.

16
00:04:31,395 --> 00:04:41,878
Filter out residue.

17
00:04:50,876 --> 00:05:00,874
Then soak the orchid branches in this water for about 20 minutes to help stimulate the cuttings to germinate very quickly.

18
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:12,872
After 20 minutes, take the orchid out.

19
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:26,869
Then clamp the orchid branch to the fixed bar.

20
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:52,897
Pour water up to 2/3 of the floral foam board.

21
00:05:56,896 --> 00:06:04,895
Cover with a transparent lid.

22
00:06:04,895 --> 00:06:12,893
Place in a cool place and change the water weekly.

23
00:06:18,892 --> 00:06:22,891
After 3 weeks.

24
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:36,889
The orchid cuttings have grown very healthy sprouts.

25
00:07:34,877 --> 00:07:42,875
Put it here so it can grow further.

26
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:55,873
Continue to place in a cool place with enough light for the orchids to grow.

27
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:06,871
After the next 2 months.

28
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:22,868
Small orchids grow very healthy and have many roots.

29
00:08:36,898 --> 00:08:46,896
With this simple method, you can completely propagate small orchids from branches at home.

30
00:09:12,891 --> 00:09:22,889
Now I plant it in a pot so the orchid can grow and adapt to the outside environment.

31
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:33,887
