00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome to my channel.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,899
If you want orchids to grow well.

3
00:00:09,899 --> 00:00:18,897
and blooms all year round.

4
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:28,895
vibrant flower color.

5
00:00:30,534 --> 00:00:36,423
Roots grow strongly to absorb more nutrients.

6
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:48,524
The flowers bloom for a long time before fading.

7
00:00:56,057 --> 00:01:05,444
Many flowers bloom at the same time on the same branch.

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,447
Let's start exploring.

9
00:01:16,053 --> 00:01:26,883
To make this wonderful fertilizer you need to take about 5 teaspoons of rice.

10
00:01:38,279 --> 00:01:48,246
Then soak the rice in 1.5 liters of water.

11
00:01:50,969 --> 00:02:00,943
Then incubate for 30 minutes to let the nutrients dissolve into the water.

12
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:33,361
After 30 minutes, filter the water.

13
00:02:40,676 --> 00:02:50,700
Next take 1 spoon of yeast (yeast used to make bread).

14
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:18,261
Incubate for 2 hours to increase beneficial microbial biomass in yeast.

15
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:33,458
After 2 hours of composting I had a great amount of fertilizer.

16
00:03:34,112 --> 00:03:38,091
FIRST METHOD.

17
00:03:39,134 --> 00:03:49,132
Wipe the top and bottom of the leaves with this fermented rice water solution

18
00:03:58,142 --> 00:04:08,118
Yeast helps eliminate fungi and harmful microorganisms very effectively.

19
00:04:22,184 --> 00:04:32,180
With this method, you do it 1-2 times/month to protect orchid leaves.

20
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:58,041
SECOND METHOD

21
00:05:00,346 --> 00:05:10,339
Use this liquid fertilizer to water the roots.

22
00:05:16,414 --> 00:05:26,403
Rice water contains many minerals and nutrients that are beneficial to plants such as:

23
00:05:26,403 --> 00:05:36,001
potassium, phosphorus and trace minerals.

24
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:52,597
These nutrients help provide good energy for orchids to grow.

25
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:08,428
The enzymes in rice water help orchids absorb water and nutrients from the substrate better.

26
00:06:22,871 --> 00:06:32,856
Soaking orchid pots in this solution for 30 minutes will be better.

27
00:06:36,775 --> 00:06:39,755
THIRD METHOD.

28
00:06:47,648 --> 00:06:57,618
You can spray this fermented rice water on the entire orchid plant.

29
00:07:05,164 --> 00:07:15,148
Spray thoroughly on both the top and bottom of the leaves.

30
00:07:20,498 --> 00:07:30,478
This method of watering roots and spraying leaves is also applied 1-2 times/month.

31
00:07:39,932 --> 00:07:59,047
But you should not spray it on flowers because wet flowers will quickly fall off.

32
00:07:59,877 --> 00:08:02,872
RESULT

33
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:12,970
 If you regularly apply this method, the orchid will always be green.

34
00:08:35,245 --> 00:08:45,230
Yeast protects and stimulates root growth very well.

35
00:09:05,428 --> 00:09:15,424
When orchids have healthy roots, they will help absorb nutrients best.

36
00:09:21,046 --> 00:09:31,021
If the orchid is nutritious and healthy, the flowers will have more vibrant colors.

37
00:09:36,253 --> 00:09:46,251
The flowers bloom on the branches for a long time before fading.

38
00:09:46,251 --> 00:09:55,882
and bloom continuously from one season to the next.
